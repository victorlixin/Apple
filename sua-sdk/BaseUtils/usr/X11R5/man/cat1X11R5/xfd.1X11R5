    The xxffdd(1X11R5) utility creates a window containing the name of the font
    being displayed, a row of command buttons, several lines of text for
    displaying character metrics, and a grid containing one glyph per cell.
    The characters are shown in increasing order from left to right, top to
    bottom. The first character displayed at the top left will be character
    number 0, unless the --ssttaarrtt option has been supplied, in which case the
    character with the number given in the --ssttaarrtt option will be used.

    The characters are displayed in a grid of boxes, each large enough to hold
    any single character in the font. Each character glyph is drawn using the
    PolyText16 request (used by the Xlib routine _X_D_r_a_w_S_t_r_i_n_g_1_6(3X11R5)). If
    the --bbooxx option is given, a rectangle will be drawn around each character,
    showing where an ImageText16 request (used by the Xlib routine
    _X_D_r_a_w_I_m_a_g_e_S_t_r_i_n_g_1_6(3X11R5)) would cause background color to be displayed.

    The origin of each glyph is normally set so that the character is drawn in
    the upper left-hand corner of the grid cell. However, if a glyph has a
    negative left bearing or an unusually large ascent, descent, or right
    bearing (as is the case with cursor font), some characters might not
    appear in their own grid cells. The --cceenntteerr option can be used to force
    all glyphs to be centered in their respective cells.

    All of the characters in the font might not fit in the window at once. To
    see the next page of glyphs, press the NNeexxtt button at the top of the
    window. To see the previous page, press PPrreevv. To exit xxffdd(1X11R5), press
    QQuuiitt.

    Individual character metrics (index, width, bearings, ascent and descent)
    can be displayed at the top of the window by pressing on the desired
    character.

    The font name displayed at the top of the window is the full name of the
    font, as determined by the server. See xxllssffoonnttss(1X11R5) for ways to
    generate lists of fonts, as well as more detailed summaries of their
    metrics and properties.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The xxffdd(1X11R5) utility accepts all of the standard toolkit command-line
    options, along with the additional following options:
    --ffnn font
        This option specifies the font to be displayed.

    --bbooxx
        This option indicates that a box should be displayed outlining the
        area that would be filled with background color by an ImageText
        request.

    --cceenntteerr
        This option indicates that each glyph should be centered in its grid.
    --ssttaarrtt number
        This option specifies the glyph index of the upper left hand corner of
        the grid. This is used to view characters at arbitrary locations in
        the font. The default is 0.
    --bbcc color
        This option specifies the color to be used if ImageText boxes are
        drawn.
