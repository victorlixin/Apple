  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    This program is used to set various user preference options of the
    display.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    --ddiissppllaayy display
        This option specifies the server to use; see _X(5X11R5).

    --bb
        The bb option controls bell volume, pitch, and duration. This option
        accepts up to three numerical parameters, a preceding dash(--), or a
        'on/off' flag. If no parameters are given, or the 'on' flag is used,
        the system defaults will be used. If the dash or 'off' are given, the
        bell will be turned off. If only one numerical parameter is given, the
        bell volume will be set to that value, as a percentage of its maximum.
        Likewise, the second numerical parameter specifies the bell pitch, in
        hertz, and the third numerical parameter specifies the duration in
        milliseconds. Note that not all hardware can vary the bell
        characteristics. The X server will set the characteristics of the bell
        as closely as it can to the user's specifications.

    bbcc
        The bbcc option controls bug compatibility mode in the server, if
        possible; a preceding dash(--) disables the mode; otherwise, the mode
        is enabled. Various pre-R4 clients pass illegal values in some
        protocol requests, and pre-R4 servers did not correctly generate
        errors in these cases. Such clients, when run against an R4 server,
        will terminate abnormally or otherwise fail to operate correctly. Bug-
        compatibility mode explicitly reintroduces certain bugs into the X
        server, so that many such clients can still be run. This mode should
        be used with care; new application development should be done with
        this mode disabled. The server must support the MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD
        protocol extension in order for this option to work.

    cc
        The cc option controls key click. This option can take an optional
        value, a preceding dash(--), or an 'on/off' flag. If no parameter or
        the 'on' flag is given, the system defaults will be used. If the dash
        or 'off' flag is used, key click will be disabled. A value from 0 to
        100 can be given to indicate volume, as a percentage of the maximum.
        The X server will set the volume to the nearest value that the
        hardware can support.
    ffpp== path,...
        The ffpp== sets the font path to the directories given in the path
        argument. The directories are interpreted by the server, not by the
        client, and are server-dependent. Directories that do not contain font
        databases created by mmkkffoonnttddiirr(1X11R5) will be ignored by the server.

    ffpp ddeeffaauulltt
        The ddeeffaauulltt argument causes the font path to be reset to the server's
        default.

    ffpp rreehhaasshh
        The rreehhaasshh argument causes the server to reread the font databases in
        the current font path. This is usually used only when adding new fonts
        to a font directory (after running mmkkffoonnttddiirr(1X11R5) to recreate the
        font database).

    --ffpp

    ffpp--
        The --ffpp and ffpp-- options remove elements from the current font path.
        They must be followed by a comma-separated list of directories.
    ++ffpp orffpp++
        The ++ffpp and ffpp++ options prepend and append elements to the current
        font path, respectively. They must be followed by a comma-separated
        list of directories.

    lleedd
        The lleedd option controls the keyboard LEDs. This controls the turning
        on or off of one or all of the LEDs. It accepts an optional integer, a
        preceding dash(--) or an 'on/off' flag. If no parameter or the 'on'
        flag is given, all LEDs are turned on. If a preceding dash or the flag
        'off' is given, all LEDs are turned off. If a value between 1 and 32
        is given, that LED will be turned on or off, depending on the
        existence of a preceding dash. A common LED that can be controlled is
        the "Caps Lock" LED. "xset led 3" would turn led #3 on. "xset -led 3"
        would turn it off. The particular LED values may refer to different
        LEDs on different hardware.

    mm
        The mm option controls the mouse parameters. The parameters for the
        mouse are 'acceleration' and 'threshold'. The acceleration can be
        specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction. The mouse, or
        whatever pointer the computer is connected to, will go 'acceleration'
        times as fast when it travels more than 'threshold' pixels in a short
        time. This way, the mouse can be used for precise alignment when it is
        moved slowly, but can also be set to travel across the screen in a
        flick of the wrist. One or both parameters for the mm option can be
        omitted, but if only one is given, it will be interpreted as the
        acceleration. If no parameters are used, or the flag 'default' is
        used, the system defaults will be set.

    pp
        The pp option controls pixel color values. The parameters are the color
        map entry number in decimal, and a color specification. The root
        background colors can be changed on some servers by altering the
        entries for BlackPixel and WhitePixel. Although these are often 0 and
        1, they need not be. Also, a server can choose to allocate those
        colors privately, in which case an error will be generated. The map
        entry must not be a read-only color, or an error will result.

    rr
        The rr option controls the autorepeat. If a preceding dash or the 'off'
        flag is used, autorepeat will be disabled. If no parameters are used,
        or the 'on' flag is used, autorepeat will be enabled.

    ss
        You can use the ss option to set the screen saver parameters. This
        option accepts up to two numerical parameters, a 'blank/noblank' flag,
        an 'expose/noexpose' flag, an 'on/off' flag, or the 'default' flag. If
        no parameters are used, or the 'default' flag is used, the system will
        be set to its default screen saver characteristics. The 'on/off' flags
        simply turn the screen saver functions on or off. The 'blank' flag
        sets the preference to blank the video (if the hardware can do so)
        rather than display a background pattern; 'noblank' sets the
        preference to display a pattern rather than blank the video. The
        'expose' flag sets the preference to allow window exposures (the
        server can freely discard window contents); 'noexpose' sets the
        preference to disable the screen saver unless the server can
        regenerate the screens without causing exposure events. The length and
        period parameters for the screen saver function determine how long the
        server must be inactive for screen saving to activate, and the period
        to change the background pattern to prevent burn in. The arguments are
        specified in seconds. If only one numerical parameter is given, it
        will be used for the length.

    qq
        The qq option gives you information on the current settings.

    These settings will be reset to default values when you log out.

    Note that not all X implementations are guaranteed to honor all of these
    options.
