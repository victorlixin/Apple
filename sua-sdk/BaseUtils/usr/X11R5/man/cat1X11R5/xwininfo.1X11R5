    The xxwwiinniinnffoo(1X11R5) utility displays information about windows. Various
    types of information can be displayed, depending on which options are
    selected. If no options are chosen, --ssttaattss is assumed.

    The user has the option of selecting the target window with the mouse (by
    clicking any mouse button in the desired window) or by specifying its
    window identifier (id) on the command line with the --iidd option. Instead of
    specifying the window by its id number, you can use the --nnaammee option to
    specify the window you want by name. There is also a special --rroooott option
    to quickly obtain information on the screen's root window.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --aallll
        Display all information possible.

    --bbiittss
        Display various attributes pertaining to the selected window's raw
        bits and how the selected window is to be stored. Displayed
        information includes the selected window's bit gravity, window
        gravity, backing-store hint, backing-planes value, backing pixel, and
        whether or not the window has save-under set.

    --cchhiillddrreenn
        Display the root, parent, and children windows' ids and names of the
        selected window.
    --ddiissppllaayy display
        Connect to specified server. See _X(5X11R5).

    --eenngglliisshh
        Display all individual height, width, and x and y positions in inches
        (and feet, yards, and miles if necessary), as well as number of
        pixels. The --mmeettrriicc and --eenngglliisshh options can both be enabled at the
        same time.

    --eevveennttss
        Display the selected window's event masks. Both the event mask of
        events wanted by some client and the event mask of events not to
        propagate are displayed.

    --ffrraammee
        Consider window manager frames when manually selecting windows.

    --hheellpp
        Print out the 'Usage:' command syntax summary.
    --iidd id
        Specify target window id on the command line rather than using the
        mouse to select the target window. This is very useful in debugging X
        applications where the target window is not mapped to the screen, or
        where the use of the mouse might be impossible or interfere with the
        application.

    --iinntt
        Display all X window identifiers as integer decimal values. The
        default is to display them as hexadecimal values.

    --mmeettrriicc
        Display all individual height, width, and x and y positions in
        millimeters as well as number of pixels, based on what the server
        thinks the resolution is. Geometry specifications that are in ++xx++yy
        form are not changed.
    --nnaammee name
        Specify the window named name as the target window on the command line
        rather than using the mouse to select the target window.

    --rroooott
        Use the root window as the target window. This is useful in situations
        where the root window is completely obscured.

    --sshhaappee
        Display the window and border shape extents of the selected window.

    --ssiizzee
        Display the selected window's sizing hints. Displayed information
        includes: for both the normal size hints and the zoom size hints; the
        user supplied location, if any; the program supplied location, if any;
        the user supplied size, if any; the program supplied size, if any; the
        minimum size, if any; the maximum size, if any; the resize increments,
        if any; and the minimum and maximum aspect ratios, if any.

    --ssttaattss
        Display various attributes pertaining to the location and appearance
        of the selected window. Information displayed includes the location of
        the window; its width and height; its depth, border width, class, and
        colormap id, if any; map state; backing-store hint; and location of
        the corners.

    --ttrreeee
        Like --cchhiillddrreenn, but displays all children recursively.

    --wwmm
        Display the selected window's window manager hints. Information
        displayed can include whether or not the application accepts input,
        the window's icon window # and name, where the window's icon should
        go, and what the window's initial state should be.

    DISPLAY
        Contains the default host and display number.

  BBUUGGSS

    Using --ssttaattss --bbiittss shows some redundant information.

    The --ggeeoommeettrryy string displayed must make assumptions about the window's
    border width and the behavior of the application and the window manager.
    As a result, the location given is not always correct.
