    The rreessiizzee(1X11R5) utility prints a shell command for setting the TERM and
    TERMCAP environment variables to indicate the current size of the
    _xx_tt_ee_rr_mm(1X11R5) window from which the command is run. For this output to
    take effect, rreessiizzee must either be evaluated as part of the command line
    (usually done with a shell alias or function) or redirected to a file that
    can then be read in. From the C shell, the following alias could be
    defined in the user's ..ccsshhrrcc file:

    % alias rs 'set noglob; eval `resize`'

    After resizing the window, the user would type:

    % rs

    Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as //bbiinn//sshh) that do
    not have command functions must send the output to a temporary file and
    then read it back in with the "." command:

    $ resize > /tmp/out
    $ . /tmp/out

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The following options can be used with rreessiizzee:

    --uu
        This option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be generated
        even if the user's current shell is not //bbiinn//sshh.

    --cc
        This option indicates that C shell commands should be generated even
        if the user's current shell is not //bbiinn//ccsshh.
    --ss [rows columns]
        This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be used
        instead of the VT100-style xxtteerrmm escape codes. If rows and columns are
        given, rreessiizzee will ask the xxtteerrmm to resize itself. The window manager
        can choose to disallow the change, however.
        The rows and columns arguments must appear last; although they are
        normally associated with the --ss option, they are parsed separately.
