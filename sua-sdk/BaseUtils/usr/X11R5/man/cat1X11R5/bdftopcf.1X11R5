    The bbddffttooppccff(1X11R5) utility is the release 5 font compiler. Fonts in
    Portable Compiled Format can be read by any architecture, although the
    file is structured to allow one particular architecture to read them
    directly without reformatting. This allows fast reading on the appropriate
    computer, but the files are still portable (but read more slowly) on other
    computers.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    --ppn
        Sets the font glyph padding. Each glyph in the font will have each
        scanline padded in to a multiple of n bytes, where n is 1, 2, 4 or 8.
    --uun
        Sets the font scanline unit. When the font bit order is different from
        the font byte order, the scanline unit n describes which unit of data
        (in bytes) is to be swapped; the unit i can be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.

    --mm
        Sets the font bit order to MSB (most significant bit) first. Bits for
        each glyph will be placed in this order; that is, the left most bit on
        the screen will be in the highest valued bit in each unit.

    --ll
        Sets the font bit order to LSB (least significant bit) first. The left
        most bit on the screen will be in the lowest valued bit in each unit.

    --MM
        Sets the font byte order to MSB first. All multibyte data in the file
        (metrics, bitmaps and everything else) will be written most
        significant byte first.

    --LL
        Sets the font byte order to LSB first. All multibyte data in the file
        (metrics, bitmaps, and so on) will be written least significant byte
        first.

    --tt
        When this option is specified, bbddffttooppccff(1X11R5) will convert fonts
        into "terminal" fonts when possible. A terminal font has each glyph
        image padded to the same size; the X server can usually render these
        types of fonts more quickly.

    --ii
        This option inhibits the normal computation of ink metrics. When a
        font has glyph images that do not fill the bitmap image (that is, the
        "on" pixels do not extend to the edges of the metrics)
        bbddffttooppccff(1X11R5) computes the actual ink metrics and places them in
        the .pcf file. The --tt option inhibits this behavior.
    --oooutput-file-name
        By default bbddffttooppccff(1X11R5) writes the pcf file to standard output;
        this option gives the name of a file to be used instead.
