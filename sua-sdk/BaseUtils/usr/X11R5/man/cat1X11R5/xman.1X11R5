    The xxmmaann(1X11R5) utility is a manual page browser. The default size of the
    initial xxmmaann(1X11R5) window is small so that you can leave it running
    throughout your entire login session. In the initial window there are
    three options: HHeellpp will pop up a window with on-line help; QQuuiitt will
    exit; and MMaannuuaall PPaaggee will pop up a window with a manual page browser in
    it. Typing CCTTRRLL++SS will pop up a window prompting for a specific manual
    page to display. You can display more than one manual page browser window
    at a time from a single execution of xxmmaann(1X11R5).

    For further information on using xxmmaann(1X11R5), please read the on-line
    help information. Most of this topic will discuss customization of
    xxmmaann(1X11R5).

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The xxmmaann(1X11R5) utility supports all standard Toolkit command-line
    arguments (see _X(5X11R5)). The following additional arguments are
    supported.

    --bbootthhsshhoowwnn
        Show both the manual page and manual directory to be on the screen at
        the same time.
    --ggeeoommeettrryyWxH++X++Y
        Set the size and location of the Top Menu with the three buttons in
        it.
    --hheellppffiillee filename
        Specify a Help file to use other than the default.

    --nnoottooppbbooxx
        Start without the Top Menu with the three buttons in it.
    --ppaaggeessiizzee WxH++X++Y
        Set the size and location of all the Manual Pages.

  CCUUSSTTOOMMIIZZIINNGG XXMMAANN

    The xxmmaann(1X11R5) utility allows customization of both the directories to
    be searched for manual pages, and the name that each directory will map to
    in the Sections menu. The xxmmaann utility determines which directories it
    will search by reading the MANPATH environment variable. If no MANPATH is
    found, the directory //uussrr//mmaann is searched on POSIX systems. This
    environment is expected to be a colon-separated list of directories for
    xxmmaann(1X11R5) to search.

    setenv MANPATH /mit/kit/man:/usr/man

    By default, xxmmaann(1X11R5) will search each of the following directories (in
    each of the directories specified in the user's MANPATH) for manual pages.
    If manual pages exist in that directory, they are added to list of manual
    pages for the corresponding menu item. A menu item is only displayed for
    those sections that actually contain manual pages.

    Directory      Section Name
    ---------      ------------
    man1           (1) User Commands
    man2           (2) System Calls
    man3           (3) Subroutines
    man4           (4) Devices
    man5           (5) File Formats
    man6           (6) Games
    man7           (7) Miscellaneous
    man8           (8) Sys. Administration
    manl           (l) Local
    mann           (n) New
    mano           (o) Old

    For instance, a user has three directories in her manual path and each
    contains a directory called mmaann33. All of these manual pages will appear,
    alphabetically sorted, when the user selects the menu item called (3)
    Subroutines. If there is no directory called mano in any of the
    directories in the user's MANPATH, or there are no manual pages in any of
    the directories called mano, no menu item will be displayed for the
    section called (o) Old.

  TTHHEE MMAANNDDEESSCC FFIILLEE

    By using the mmaannddeesscc file, a user or system manager can more closely
    control which manual pages will appear in each of the sections represented
    by menu items in the Sections menu. This functionality is only available
    on a section-by-section basis, and individual manual pages cannot be
    handled in this manner.

    The format of the mmaannddeesscc file is a character followed by a label. The
    character determines which of the sections will be added under this label.
    For instance, suppose that you want to create an extra menu item that
    contains all programmer subroutines. This label should contain all manual
    pages in both sections two and three. The mmaannddeesscc file would look like
    this:

    2Programmer Subroutines
    3Programmer Subroutines

    This will add a menu item to the Sections menu that would bring up a
    listing of all manual pages in sections two and three of the Programmers
    Manual. Because the label names are exactly the same, they will be added
    to the same section. Note, however, that the original sections still
    exist.

    If you want to completely ignore the default sections in a manual
    directory, add the line:

    no default sections

    anywhere in your mmaannddeesscc file. This keeps xxmmaann(1X11R5) from searching the
    default manual sections In that directory only. For example, suppose you
    want to do the same thing as above, but you do not think that it is still
    useful to have the System Calls or Subroutines sections. You would need to
    duplicate the default entries, as well as adding your new one.

    no default sections
    1(1) User Commands
    2Programmer Subroutines
    3Programmer Subroutines
    4(4) Devices
    5(5) File Formats
    6(6) Games
    7(7) Miscellaneous
    8(8) Sys. Administration
    l(l) Local
    n(n) New
    o(o) Old

    The xxmmaann utility will read any section that is of the form man<character>,
    where <character> is an uppercase or lowercase letter (they are treated
    distinctly) or a numeral (0-9). Be warned, however, that mmaann(1) and ccaattmmaann
    will not search directories that are non-standard.

  WWIIDDGGEETTSS

    In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the
    widgets which compose xxmmaann(1X11R5). In the notation below, indentation
    indicates hierarchical structure. The widget class name is given first,
    followed by the widget instance name.

  GGLLOOBBAALL AACCTTIIOONNSS

    The xxmmaann(1X11R5) utility defines all user interaction through global
    actions. This allows the user to modify the translation table of any
    widget, and bind any event to the new user action. The list of actions
    supported by xxmmaann(1X11R5) are as follows:
    GGoottooPPaaggee((page))
        When used in a manual page display window, this will allow the user to
        move between a directory and manual page display. The page argument
        can be either DDiirreeccttoorryy or MMaannuuaallPPaaggee.

    QQuuiitt(())
        This action can be used anywhere, and will exit xxmmaann(1X11R5).
    SSeeaarrcchh((type,,action))
        Only useful when used in a search popup, this action will cause the
        search widget to perform the named search type on the string in the
        search popup's value widget. This action will also pop down the search
        widget. The type argument can be either AApprrooppooss, MMaannppaaggee or CCaanncceell. If
        an action of OOppeenn is specified, xxmmaann(1X11R5) will open a new manual
        page to display the results of the search; otherwise, xxmmaann(1X11R5)
        will attempt to display the results in the parent of the search popup.

    PPooppuuppHHeellpp(())
        This action can be used anywhere, and will popup the Help widget.

    PPooppuuppSSeeaarrcchh(())
        This action can be used anywhere except in a Help window. It will
        cause the search popup to become active and visible on the screen,
        allowing the user search for a manual page.

    CCrreeaatteeNNeewwMMaannppaaggee(())
        This action can be used anywhere, and will create a new manual page
        display window.

    RReemmoovveeTThhiissMMaannppaaggee(())
        This action can be used in any manual page or help display window.
        When called, it will remove the window and clean up all resources
        associated with it.
    SSaavveeFFoorrmmaatttteeddPPaaggee((action))
        This action can only be used in the lliikkeeTTooSSaavvee popup widget, and tells
        xxmmaann(1X11R5) whether to SSaavvee or CCaanncceell a save of the manual page that
        has just been formatted.

    SShhoowwVVeerrssiioonn(())
        This action can be called from any manual page or help display window,
        and will cause the informational display line to show the current
        version of xxmmaann(1X11R5).

    DISPLAY
        Contains the default host and display to use.

    MANPATH
        Contains the search path for manual pages. Directories are separated
        by colons; for example:
        //uussrr//mmaann:://mmiitt//kkiitt//mmaann:://ccaatt//ddoogg//mmaann

    XENVIRONMENT
        Contains the name of a resource file that overrides the global
        resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

    XAPPLRESDIR
        A string that will have "Xman" appended to it. This string will be the
        full path name of a user app-defaults file to be merged into the
        resource database after the system app-defaults file, and before the
        resources that are attached to the display.
