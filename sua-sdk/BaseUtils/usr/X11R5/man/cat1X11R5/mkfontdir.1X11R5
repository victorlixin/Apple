    For each directory argument, mmkkffoonnttddiirr(1X11R5) reads all of the font files
    in the directory searching for properties named "FONT", or (failing that)
    the name of the file stripped of its suffix. These are used as font names,
    which are written out to the file "fonts.dir" in the directory along with
    the name of the font file.

    The kinds of font files read by mmkkffoonnttddiirr(1X11R5) depends on configuration
    parameters, but typically include PCF (suffix ".pcf"), SNF (suffix ".snf")
    and BDF (suffix ".bdf"). If a font exists in multiple formats,
    mmkkffoonnttddiirr(1X11R5) will first choose PCF, then SNF and finally BDF.

    Because scalable font files do not usually include the X font name, the
    fonts.dir file in directories containing such fonts must be edited by hand
    to include the appropriate entries for those fonts. Be aware, however,
    that when mmkkffoonnttddiirr(1X11R5) is run, all of those additions will be lost,
    so be careful.

    The file ffoonnttss..aalliiaass, which can be put in any directory of the font-path,
    is used to map new names to existing fonts, and should be edited by hand.
    The format is straightforward: two white-space separated columns, the
    first containing aliases, and the second containing font-name patterns.

    When a font alias is used, the name it references is searched for in the
    normal manner; each font directory is scrutinized in turn. This means that
    the aliases need not mention fonts in the same directory as the alias
    file.

    To embed white space in either name, simply enclose the name in double
    quotation marks (""). To embed quotation marks (or any other character),
    precede them with backslash (\\):

    "magic-alias with spaces"     "\"font\name\" with quotes"
    regular-alias            fixed

    If the string "FILE_NAMES_ALIASES" stands alone on a line, each file-name
    in the directory (stripped of its suffix) will be used as an alias for
    that font.

    Both the XX sseerrvveerr and the FFoonntt SSeerrvveerr look for ffoonnttss..ddiirr and ffoonnttss..aalliiaass
    files in each directory in the font path each time it is set (see
    xxsseett(1X11R5)).
