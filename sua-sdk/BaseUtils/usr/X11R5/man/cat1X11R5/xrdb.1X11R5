    The xxrrddbb(1X11R5) utility is used to get or set the contents of the
    RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of screen 0, or the
    SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of any or all screens, or
    everything combined. You would normally run this program from your X
    startup file.

    Most X clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to
    get user preferences about such things as colors, fonts, and so on for
    applications. Having this information in the server (where it is available
    to all clients) instead of on disk solves the problem in previous versions
    of X that required you to maintain defaults files on every computer that
    you might use. It also allows for dynamic changing of defaults without
    editing files.

    The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is used for resources that apply to all
    screens of the display. The SCREEN_RESOURCES property on each screen
    specifies additional (or overriding) resources to be used for that screen.
    (When there is only one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally not used, all
    resources are just placed in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.)

    The file specified by filename (or the contents from standard input if --
    or no file name is given) is optionally passed through the C preprocessor
    with the following symbols defined, based on the capabilities of the
    server being used:
    BBIITTSS__PPEERR__RRGGBB==num
        The number of significant bits in an red-green-blue (RGB) color
        specification. This is the log base 2 of the number of distinct shades
        of each primary that the hardware can generate. Note that it usually
        is not related to PLANES.
    CCLLAASSSS==visualclass
        One of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor,
        DirectColor. This is the visual class of the root window of the
        default screen.

    CCOOLLOORR
        Defined only if CLASS is one of StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor,
        or DirectColor.
    HHEEIIGGHHTT==num
        The height of the default screen in pixels.
    SSEERRVVEERRHHOOSSTT==hostname
        The host-name portion of the display to which you are connected.
    HHOOSSTT==hostname
        The same as SSEERRVVEERRHHOOSSTT.
    CCLLIIEENNTTHHOOSSTT==hostname
        The name of the host on which xxrrddbb(1X11R5) is running.
    PPLLAANNEESS==num
        The number of bit planes (the depth) of the root window of the default
        screen.
    RREELLEEAASSEE==num
        The vendor release number for the server. The interpretation of this
        number will vary depending on VENDOR.
    RREEVVIISSIIOONN==num
        The X protocol minor version supported by this server (currently 0).
    VVEERRSSIIOONN==num
        The X protocol major version supported by this server (should always
        be 11).
    VVEENNDDOORR==vendor
        A string specifying the vendor of the server.
    WWIIDDTTHH==num
        The width of the default screen in pixels.
    XX__RREESSOOLLUUTTIIOONN==num
        The x resolution of the default screen in pixels per meter.
    YY__RREESSOOLLUUTTIIOONN==num
        The y resolution of the default screen in pixels per meter.

    Lines that begin with an exclamation mark (!!) are ignored and can be used
    as comments.

    Note that since xxrrddbb(1X11R5) can read from standard input, it can be used
    to the change the contents of properties directly from a terminal or from
    a shell script.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The xxrrddbb(1X11R5) program accepts the following options:

    --aallll
        Perform the operation on the screen-independent resource property
        (RESOURCE_MANAGER), as well as the screen-specific property
        (SCREEN_RESOURCES) on every screen of the display. For example, when
        used in conjunction with --qquueerryy, the contents of all properties are
        output. For --llooaadd and --mmeerrggee, the input file is processed once for
        each screen. The resources that occur in common in the output for
        every screen are collected, and these are applied as the screen-
        independent resources. The remaining resources are applied for each
        individual per-screen property. This the default mode of operation.
    --bbaacckkuupp string
        Generate a backup file with --eeddiitt, using string as a suffix appended
        to the file name used with --eeddiitt.
    --ccpppp filename
        Use filename as the C preprocessor program( CPP) to be used. Although
        xxrrddbb(1X11R5) was designed to use CPP, any program that acts as a
        filter and accepts the --DD, --II, and --UU options can be used.
    --DDname[==value]
        Define symbols for use with conditionals such as ##iiffddeeff; this option
        is passed through to the preprocessor.
    --ddiissppllaayy display
        Use the X server specified by display; XX(5X11R5). It also specifies
        the screen to use for the --ssccrreeeenn option, and it specifies the screen
        from which preprocessor symbols are derived for the --gglloobbaall option.
    --eeddiitt filename
        Edit the contents of the specified properties into the given file,
        replacing any values already listed there. This allows you to put
        changes that you have made to your defaults back into your resource
        file, preserving any comments or preprocessor lines.

    --gglloobbaall
        Perform the operation only on the screen-independent RESOURCE_MANAGER
        property.

    --hheellpp
        Print a brief description of the allowable options and parameters to
        be printed; any unsupported option causes the message to be printed.

    --llooaadd
        Load the input as the new value of the specified properties, replacing
        whatever was there (that is, removing the old contents). This is the
        default action.

    --mmeerrggee
        Instead of replacing the current contents of the specified properties,
        merge the input with it. This option does a lexicographic sorted merge
        of the two inputs, which is almost certainly not what you want, but
        remains for backward compatibility.

    --nn
        Display the result of the command without really doing it. Changes to
        the specified properties (when used with --llooaadd or --mmeerrggee) or to the
        resource file (when used with --eeddiitt) are shown on the standard output
        but not performed.

    --nnooccpppp
        Do not run the input file through a preprocessor before loading it
        into properties.

    --qquueerryy
        Print the current contents of the specified properties onto standard
        output. Since preprocessor commands in the input resource file are
        part of the input file, not part of the property, they will not appear
        in the output from this option. The --eeddiitt option can be used to merge
        the contents of properties back into the input resource file without
        damaging preprocessor commands.

    --qquuiieett
        Do not display warnings about duplicate entries.

    --rreemmoovvee
        Remove the specified properties from the server.

    --rreettaaiinn
        Do not reset the server if xxrrddbb(1X11R5) is the first client. This
        should never be necessary under normal conditions, since xxddmm and xxiinniitt
        always act as the first client.

    --ssccrreeeenn
        Perform the operation only on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of the
        default screen of the display.

    --ssccrreeeennss
        Perform the operation only on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of each
        screen of the display. For --llooaadd and --mmeerrggee, the input file is
        processed for each screen.

    --ssyymmbboollss
        Print onto the standard output the symbols that are defined for the
        preprocessor.

  FFIILLEESS

    Generalizes ~~//..XXddeeffaauullttss files.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS

    DISPLAY
        Contains which display to use.

  BBUUGGSS

    The default for no arguments should be to query, not to overwrite, so that
    it is consistent with other programs.
