    The xxsseettrroooott(1X11R5) program allows you to tailor the appearance of the
    background ("root") window on a workstation display running X. You can
    experiment with xxsseettrroooott(1X11R5) until you find an appearance you like,
    then put the xxsseettrroooott(1X11R5) command that produces it into your X startup
    file. If no options are specified, or if --ddeeff is specified, the window is
    reset to its default state. The --ddeeff option can be specified along with
    other options and only the unspecified characteristics will be reset to
    the default state.

    Only one of the background color/tiling changing options (--ssoolliidd, --ggrraayy, --
    ggrreeyy, --bbiittmmaapp, or --mmoodd) can be specified at a time.

    The options are as follows:
    --bbgg color
        Use color as the background color.
    --bbiittmmaapp filename
        Use the bitmap specified in the file to set the window pattern. You
        can make your own bitmap files (little pictures) using the
        bbiittmmaapp(1X11R5) program. The entire background will be made up of
        repeated "tiles" of the bitmap.
    --ccuurrssoorr cursorfile maskfile
        This lets you change the pointer cursor to whatever you want when the
        pointer cursor is outside of any window. Cursor and mask files are
        bitmaps (little pictures), and can be made with the bbiittmmaapp(1X11R5)
        program. You probably want the mask file to be all black until you get
        accustomed to the way masks work.
    --ccuurrssoorr__nnaammee cursorname
        This lets you change the pointer cursor to one of the standard cursors
        from the cursor font. Refer to appendix B of the X protocol for the
        names (except that the XC_ prefix is elided for this option).

    --ddeeff
        Reset unspecified attributes to the default values. (Restores the
        background to the familiar gray mesh and the cursor to the hollow x
        shape.)
    --ddiissppllaayy display
        Specifies the server to connect to; see XX(5X11R5).
    --ffgg color
        Use color as the foreground color. Foreground and background colors
        are meaningful only in combination with --ccuurrssoorr, --bbiittmmaapp, and --mmoodd.

    --ggrraayy
        Make the entire background gray. (Easier on the eyes.)

    --ggrreeyy
        Make the entire background grey.

    --hheellpp
        Print a usage message and exit.
    --mmoodd x y
        This is used if you want a plaid-like grid pattern on your screen. x
        and y are integers ranging from 1 to 16. Try the different
        combinations. Zero and negative numbers are taken as 1.
    --nnaammee string
        Set the name of the root window to string. There is no default value.
        Usually, a name is assigned to a window so that the window manager can
        use a text representation when the window is iconified. This option is
        unused since you cannot iconify the background.

    --rrvv
        This exchanges the foreground and background colors. Normally, the
        foreground color is black and the background color is white.
    --ssoolliidd color
        This sets the background of the root window to the specified color.
        This option is only useful on color servers.
