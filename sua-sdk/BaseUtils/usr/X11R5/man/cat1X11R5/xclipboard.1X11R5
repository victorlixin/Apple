    The xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5) program is used to collect and display text
    selections that are sent to the CLIPBOARD by other clients. It is
    typically used to save CLIPBOARD selections for later use. It stores each
    CLIPBOARD selection as a separate string, each of which can be selected.
    Each time CLIPBOARD is asserted by another application, xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5)
    transfers the contents of that selection to a new buffer and displays it
    in the text window. Buffers are never automatically deleted, so you should
    use the delete button to get rid of useless items.

    Because xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5) uses a Text Widget to display the contents of
    the clipboard, text sent to the CLIPBOARD can be reselected for use in
    other applications. The xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5) utility also responds to
    requests for the CLIPBOARD selection from other clients by sending the
    entire contents of the currently displayed buffer.

    The xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5) window displays the following buttons across the
    top:

    quit
        When this button is pressed, xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5) exits.

    delete
        When this button is pressed, the current buffer is deleted and the
        next one displayed.

    new
        Creates a new buffer with no contents. Useful in constructing a new
        CLIPBOARD selection by hand.

    next
        Displays the next buffer in the list.

    previous
        Displays the previous buffer.

    The xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5) program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit
    command-line options, as well as the following:

    --nnww
        This option indicates that long lines of text should not wrap around.
        This is the default behavior.

    --ww
        This option indicates that lines of text that are too long to be
        displayed on one line in the clipboard should wrap around to the
        following lines.

    In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the
    widgets which compose xxcclliippbbooaarrdd(1X11R5). In the following notation,
    indentation indicates hierarchical structure. The widget class name is
    given first, followed by the widget instance name.

    Text is copied to the clipboard whenever a client asserts ownership of the
    CCLLIIPPBBOOAARRDD selection. Text is copied from the clipboard whenever a client
    requests the contents of the CCLLIIPPBBOOAARRDD selection. Examples of event
    bindings that a user might want to include in a resource configuration
    file to use the clipboard are as follows:

    *VT100.Translations: #override \
      <Btn3Up>:select-end(CLIPBOARD) \n\
      <Btn2Up>:insert-selection(PRIMARY,CLIPBOARD) \n\
