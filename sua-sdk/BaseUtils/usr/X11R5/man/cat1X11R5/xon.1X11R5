  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The xxoonn(1X11R5) utility runs the specified command (default xxtteerrmm --llss) on
    the remote computer using rrsshh(1). The xxoonn(1X11R5) utility passes the
    DISPLAY, XAUTHORITY and XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variables to the
    remote command.

    When no command is specified, xxoonn(1X11R5) runs xxtteerrmm --llss. It additionally
    specifies the application name to be xxtteerrmm--remote-host and the window
    title to be --ffIIrreemmoottee--hhoosstt..

    The xxoonn(1X11R5) utility can only work when the remote host will allow you
    to use rrsshh, by having an entry in the ..rrhhoossttss file permitting access.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    Note that the options follow the remote host name (as they do with
    rrllooggiinn(1)).

    --aacccceessss
        Run xxhhoosstt locally to add the remote host to the host access list in
        the X server. This will not work unless xxhhoosstt has permission to modify
        the access list.

    --ddeebbuugg
        Normally, xxoonn(1X11R5) disconnects the remote process from stdin,
        stdout and stderr to eliminate the daemon processes that usually
        connect them across the network. Specifying the --ddeebbuugg option leaves
        them connected so that error messages from the remote execution are
        sent back to the originating host.
    --nnaammee window-name
        Set the application name and window title for the default command
        (_xx_tt_ee_rr_mm(1X11R5)).

    --nnoollss
        Normally xxoonn(1X11R5) passes the --llss option to the remote
        xxtteerrmm(1X11R5); this option suspends that behavior.
    --ssccrreeeenn screen-no
        Change the screen number of the DISPLAY variable passed to the remote
        command.
    --uusseerr user-name
        By default, xxoonn(1X11R5) simply uses rrsshh to connect to the remote
        computer using the same user name as on the local computer. This
        option causes xxoonn(1X11R5) to specify an alternative user name. This
        will not work unless you are authorized to access the remote account
        through rrsshh by placing an appropriate entry in the remote user's
        ..rrhhoossttss file.

  BBUUGGSS

    The xxoonn(1X11R5) utility can get easily confused when the remote-host,
    user-name or various environment variable values contain white space.

    The xxoonn(1X11R5) utility has no way to send the appropriate X authorization
    information to the remote host.
