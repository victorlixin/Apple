    The xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) program is used to copy the current selection into a
    cut buffer and to make a selection that contains the current contents of
    the cut buffer. It acts as a bridge between applications that do not
    support selections and those that do.

    By default, xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) will use the selection named PRIMARY and the
    cut buffer CUT_BUFFER0. Either or both of these can be overridden by
    command-line arguments or by resources.

    An xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) window has the following buttons:

    quit
        When this button is pressed, xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) exits. Any selections
        held by xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) are automatically released.

    copy PRIMARY to 0
        When this button is pressed, xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) copies the current
        selection into the cut buffer.

    copy 0 to PRIMARY
        When this button is pressed, xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) converts the current
        contents of the cut buffer into the selection.

    The button labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer selected by command-
    line options or through the resource database.

    When the copy 0 to PRIMARY button is activated, the button will remain
    inverted as long as xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) remains the owner of the selection.
    This serves to remind you which client owns the current selection. Note
    that the value of the selection remains constant; if the cutbuffer is
    changed, you must reactivate the copy button to retrieve the new value.

    The xxccuuttsseell(1X11R5) utility accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command-
    line options, as well as the following:
    --ccuuttbbuuffffeerr number
        Use cut buffer number. The default is cut buffer 0.
    --sseelleeccttiioonn name
        Use selection name. The default is PRIMARY. The only supported
        abbreviations for this option are --sseelleecctt, --sseell and --ss, because the
        standard toolkit option --sseelleeccttiioonnTTiimmeeoouutt has a similar name.

  XX DDEEFFAAUULLTTSS

    This program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit resource names and
    classes as well as the following:
    sseelleeccttiioonn (classSSeelleeccttiioonn)
        This resource specifies the name of the selection to use. The default
        is PRIMARY.
    ccuuttBBuuffffeerr (classCCuuttBBuuffffeerr)
        This resource specifies the number of the cut buffer to use. The
        default is 0.

  WWIIDDGGEETT NNAAMMEESS

    The following instance names can be used when user configuration of the
    labels in them is desired:
    sseell--ccuutt (classCCoommmmaanndd)
        This is the copy SELECTION to BUFFER button.
    ccuutt--sseell (classCCoommmmaanndd)
        This is the copy BUFFER to SELECTION button.
    qquuiitt (classCCoommmmaanndd)
        This is the quit button.

  BBUUGGSS

    There is no way to change the name of the selection or the number of the
    cut buffer while the program is running.
