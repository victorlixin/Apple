    The xxbbiiffff(1X11R5) program displays a little image of a mailbox. When there
    is no mail, the flag on the mailbox is down. When mail arrives, the flag
    goes up and the mailbox beeps. By default, pressing any mouse button in
    the image forces xxbbiiffff(1X11R5) to remember the current size of the mail
    file as being the "empty" size and to lower the flag.

    This program is nothing more than a wrapper around the Athena Mailbox
    widget.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The xxbbiiffff(1X11R5) program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command-
    line options along with the additional following options:
    --ffiillee filename
        This option specifies the name of the file that should be monitored.
        By default, it watches //uussrr//ssppooooll//mmaaiill//username, where username is
        your login name.

    --hheellpp
        This option indicates that a brief summary of the allowed options
        should be printed on the standard error.

    --sshhaappee
        This option indicates that the mailbox window should be shaped if
        masks for the empty or full images are given.
    --uuppddaattee seconds
        This option specifies the frequency in seconds at which xxbbiiffff(1X11R5)
        should update its display. If the mailbox is obscured and then
        exposed, it will be updated immediately. The default is 30 seconds.
    --vvoolluummee percentage
        This option specifies how loud the bell should be rung when new mail
        comes in.

    The following standard X Toolkit command-line arguments are commonly used
    with xxbbiiffff(1X11R5):
    --ddiissppllaayy display
        This option specifies the X server to contact.
    --ggeeoommeettrryy geometry
        This option specifies the preferred size and position of the mailbox
        window. The mailbox is 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels high and will be
        centered in the window.
    --bbgg color
        This option specifies the color to use for the background of the
        window.
    --bbdd color
        This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window.
    --bbww number
        This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding
        the window.
    --ffgg color
        This option specifies the color to use for the foreground of the
        window.

    --rrvv
        This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by
        swapping the foreground and background colors.
    --xxrrmm resourcestring
        This option specifies a resource string to be used. This is especially
        useful for setting resources that do not have separate command-line
        options.

  XX DDEEFFAAUULLTTSS

    The application class name is XBiff. This program uses the Mailbox widget
    in the Athena widget set. It understands all of the core resource names
    and classes as well as the following:
    cchheecckkCCoommmmaanndd (class CChheecckkCCoommmmaanndd)
        Specifies a shell command to be executed to check for new mail rather
        than examining the size of file. The specified string value is used as
        the argument to a _s_y_s_t_e_m(3) call and can therefore contain input/
        output (I/O) redirection. An exit status of 0 indicates that new mail
        is waiting, 1 indicates that there has been no change in size, and 2
        indicates that the mail has been cleared. By default, no shell command
        is provided.
    ffiillee (class FFiillee)
        Specifies the name of the file to monitor. The default is to watch //
        uussrr//ssppooooll//mmaaiill//username, where username is your login name.
    oonncceeOOnnllyy (class BBoooolleeaann)
        Specifies that the bell is only rung the first time new mail is found
        and is not rung again until at least one interval has passed with no
        mail waiting. The window will continue to indicate the presence of new
        mail until it has been retrieved. The default is false.
    wwiiddtthh (class WWiiddtthh)
        Specifies the width of the mailbox.
    hheeiigghhtt (class HHeeiigghhtt)
        Specifies the height of the mailbox.
    uuppddaattee (class IInntteerrvvaall)
        Specifies the frequency in seconds at which the mail should be
        checked. The default is 30.
    vvoolluummee (class VVoolluummee)
        Specifies how loud the bell should ring. The default is 33 percent.
    ffoorreeggrroouunndd (class FFoorreeggrroouunndd)
        Specifies the color for the foreground.
    rreevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo (classRReevveerrsseeVViiddeeoo)
        Specifies that the foreground and background should be reversed.
    fflliipp (class FFlliipp)
        Specifies whether the image that shows when mail has arrived should be
        inverted. The default is "true."
    ffuullllPPiixxmmaapp (class PPiixxmmaapp)
        Specifies a bitmap to be shown when new mail has arrived. The default
        is flagup.
    eemmppttyyPPiixxmmaapp (class PPiixxmmaapp)
        Specifies a bitmap to be shown when no new mail is present. The
        default is flagdown.
    sshhaappeeWWiinnddooww (class SShhaappeeWWiinnddooww)
        Specifies whether the mailbox window should be shaped to the given
        fullPixmapMask and emptyPixmapMask. The default is false.
    ffuullllPPiixxmmaappMMaasskk (class PPiixxmmaappMMaasskk)
        Specifies a mask for the bitmap to be shown when new mail has arrived.
        The default is none.
    eemmppttyyPPiixxmmaappMMaasskk (class PPiixxmmaappMMaasskk)
        Specifies a mask for the bitmap to be shown when no new mail is
        present. The default is none.

  AACCTTIIOONNSS

    The Mailbox widget provides the following actions for use in event
    translations:
    cchheecckk()
        This action causes the widget to check for new mail and display the
        flag appropriately.
    uunnsseett()
        This action causes the widget to lower the flag until new mail comes
        in.
    sseett()
        This action causes the widget to raise the flag until the user resets
        it.

    The default translation is

    <ButtonPress>:  unset()
