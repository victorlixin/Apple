    The xxmmaagg(1X11R5) program allows you to magnify portions of an X screen. If
    no explicit region is specified, a square with the pointer in the upper-
    left corner is displayed indicating the area to be enlarged. The area can
    be dragged out to the size you want by pressing Button 2. After a region
    has been selected, a window pops up showing a blown-up version of the
    region in which each pixel in the source image is represented by a small
    square of the same color. Pressing Button 1 in the enlargement window
    shows the position and red-green-blue (RGB) value of the pixel under the
    pointer until the button is released. Typing QQ or ^^CC in the enlargement
    window exits the program.

    The application has the following five buttons across the top:

    Close
        Delete this particular magnification instance.

    Replace
        Bring up the rubber-band selector again to select another region for
        this magnification instance.

    New
        Bring up the rubber-band selector to create a new magnification
        instance.

    Cut
        Put the magnification image into the primary selection.

    Paste
        Copy the primary selection buffer into xxmmaagg(1X11R5).

    You can cut and paste between xxmmaagg(1X11R5) and the bbiittmmaapp(1X11R5) program.
    Resizing xxmmaagg(1X11R5) resizes the magnification area. The xxmmaagg(1X11R5)
    utility preserves the colormap, visual, and window depth of the source.

    The xxmmaagg(1X11R5) utility uses the X Toolkit and the Athena Widget Set. The
    magnified image is displayed in the Scale widget. For more information,
    see the Athena Widget Set documentation.

    Below is the widget structure of the xxmmaagg(1X11R5) application. Indentation
    indicates hierarchical structure. The widget class name is given first,
    followed by the widget instance name.
