  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The lliissttrreess(1X11R5) program generates a list of a widget's resource
    database. The list includes the class in which each resource is first
    defined, the instance and class name, and the type of each resource. If no
    specific widgets or the --aallll switch is given, a two-column list of widget
    names and their class hierarchies is printed.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The lliissttrreess(1X11R5) utility accepts all of the standard toolkit command-
    line options. It also accepts those provided in the following list:

    --aallll
        This option indicates that lliissttrreess(1X11R5) should print information
        for all known widgets and objects.

    --nnoossuuppeerr
        This option indicates that resources inherited from a superclass
        should not be listed. This is useful for determining which resources
        are new to a subclass.

    --vvaarriiaabbllee
        This option indicates that widgets should be identified by the names
        of the class record variables rather than the class name given in the
        variable. This is useful for distinguishing subclasses that have the
        same class name as their superclasses.
    --ttoopp name
        This option specifies the name of the widget to be treated as the top
        of the hierarchy. Case is not significant, and the name can match
        either the class variable name or the class name. The default is
        "core".
    --ffoorrmmaatt printf-string
        This option specifies the _pp_rr_ii_nn_tt_ff(3)-style format string to be used to
        print out the name, instance, class, and type of each resource.

  BBUUGGSS

    On operating systems that do not support dynamic linking of run-time
    routines, this program must have all of its known widgets compiled in. The
    sources provide several tools for automating this process for various
    widget sets.
