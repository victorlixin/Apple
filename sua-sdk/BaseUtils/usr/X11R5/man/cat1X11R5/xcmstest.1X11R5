    The xxccmmsstteesstt(1X11R5) utility was developed as a simple test interface for
    testing the XCMS application programming interface (API) library during
    its development.

    Insure that the Screen Color Characterization Data has been placed in the
    appropriate properties on the screen's root window. To load these
    properties, refer to the xxccmmssddbb utility provided with this release.

    In order to convert color names using a client-side color name database,
    the database file must be specified by using the XCMSDB environment
    variable.

    To use the sample database provided with this release set XCMSDB as
    follows:

    $$ setenv XCMSDB 'pwd'/Xcms.txt

    Upon invoking xxccmmsstteesstt(1X11R5), you should receive the "XCMS >" prompt. At
    this point, you can begin entering commands.

    To list the commands currently available enter lliisstt:

    XCMS >  list

    To receive help for a specific command enter the command name followed by
    --hheellpp. For example:

    XCMS >  LookupColor -help

    The --eecchhoo option provides a more readable output, echoing the command from
    the cmdfile. At some point, you might want to try using some simple test
    cases provided with the release (in the ttcc directory; for instance, tteesstt11,
    tteesstt22, AAllllooccNNCCoolloorr, ggaammuuttqquueerryy). For file tteesstt11, invoke xxccmmsstteesstt(1X11R5)
    as follows:

    $$ xcmstest -echo < tc/test1

    Color name strings passed to xxccmmsstteesstt(1X11R5) commands cannot contain a
    space. Because spaces are ignored by the XCMS API library, however, you
    can pass a color name with the spaces eliminated. For example:

    XCMS >  LookupColor cornflowerblue UNDEFINED RGB
