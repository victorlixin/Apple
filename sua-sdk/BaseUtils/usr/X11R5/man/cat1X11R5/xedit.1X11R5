    The xxeeddiitt(1X11R5) utility provides a window consisting of the following
    four areas:

    Commands Section
        A set of commands you can use to exit xxeeddiitt(1X11R5), save the file, or
        load a new file into the edit window.

    Message Window
        Displays xxeeddiitt(1X11R5) messages. In addition, this window can be used
        as a scratch pad.

    Filename Display
        Displays the name of the file currently being edited, and whether this
        file is Read-Write or Read Only.

    Edit Window
        Displays the text of the file that you are editing or creating.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The xxeeddiitt(1X11R5) utility accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command-
    line options (see _X(5X11R5)). The order of the command-line options is not
    important.

    filename
        Specifies the file to be loaded during start-up. This is the file that
        will be edited. If a file is not specified, xxeeddiitt(1X11R5) lets you
        load a file or create a new file after it has started up.

    The Athena Text widget is used for the three sections of this application
    that allow text input. The characters typed will go to the Text widget
    that the pointer cursor is currently over. If the pointer cursor is not
    over a text widget, the key presses will have no effect on the
    application. This is also true for the special key sequences that pop-up
    dialog widgets, so typing Ctrl-s in the file name widget will enable
    searching in that widget, not the edit widget.

    Both the message window and the edit window will create a scrollbar if the
    text to display is too large to fit in that window. Horizontal scrolling
    is not allowed by default, but can be turned on through the Text widget's
    resources, see Athena Widget Set for the exact resource definition.

    The following keystroke combinations are defined:

    Ctrl-a                   Beginning Of Line

    Ctrl-b                   Backward Character

  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS

    QQuuiitt
        Quits the current editing session. If any changes have not been saved,
        xxeeddiitt(1X11R5) displays a warning message allowing the user to save the
        file.

    SSaavvee
        If file backups are enabled (see RESOURCES, below) xxeeddiitt(1X11R5)
        stores a copy of the original, unedited file in <prefix>file<suffix>,
        then overwrites the file with the contents of the edit window. The
        file name is retrieved from the Text widget directly to the right of
        the Load button.

    LLooaadd
        Loads the file named in the text widget immediately to the right of
        the this button and displays it in the Edit window. If the currently
        displayed file has been modified, a warning message asks the user to
        save the changes or press Load again.

    For xxeeddiitt(1X11R5) the available resources are:
    eennaabblleeBBaacckkuuppss (ClassEEnnaabblleeBBaacckkuuppss)
        Specifies that, when edits made to an existing file are saved,
        xxeeddiitt(1X11R5) is to copy the original version of that file to
        <prefix>file<suffix> before it saves the changes. The default value
        for this resource is "off," stating that no backups should be created.
    bbaacckkuuppNNaammeePPrreeffiixx (ClassBBaacckkuuppNNaammeePPrreeffiixx)

    In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the
    widgets that compose xxeeddiitt(1X11R5). In the notation below, indentation
    indicates hierarchical structure. The widget class name is given first,
    followed by the widget instance name.
