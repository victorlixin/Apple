    The xxkkiillll(1X11R5) utility forces the X server to close connections to
    clients. This program is very dangerous, but is useful for aborting
    programs that have displayed undesired windows on a user's screen. If no
    resource identifier is given with --iidd, xxkkiillll(1X11R5) will display a
    special cursor as a prompt for the user to select a window to be killed.
    If a pointer button is pressed over a non-root window, the server will
    close its connection to the client that created the window.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --aallll
        This option indicates that all clients with top-level windows on the
        screen should be killed. The xxkkiillll(1X11R5) utility will ask you to
        select the root window with each of the currently defined buttons to
        give you several chances to abort. Use of this option is highly
        discouraged.
    --bbuuttttoonn number
        This option specifies the number of pointer button that should be used
        in selecting a window to kill. If the word "any" is specified, any
        button on the pointer can be used. By default, the first button in the
        pointer map (which is usually the leftmost button) is used.
    --ddiissppllaayy displayname
        This option specifies the name of the X server to contact.

    --ffrraammee
        This option indicates that xxkkiillll should ignore the standard
        conventions for finding top-level client windows (which are typically
        nested inside a window manager window), and simply believe that you
        want to kill direct children of the root.
    --iidd resource
        This option specifies the X identifier for the resource whose creator
        is to be aborted. If no resource is specified, xxkkiillll(1X11R5) will
        display a special cursor with which you should select a window to be
        kill.
