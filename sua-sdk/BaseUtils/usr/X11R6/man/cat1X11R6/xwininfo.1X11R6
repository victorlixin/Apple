    Xwininfo is a utility for displaying information about windows. Various
    information is displayed depending on which options are selected. If no
    options are chosen, --ssttaattss is assumed.

    The user has the option of selecting the target window with the mouse (by
    clicking any mouse button in the desired window) or by specifying its
    window id on the command line with the --iidd option. Or instead of
    specifying the window by its id number, the --nnaammee option may be used to
    specify which window is desired by name. There is also a special --rroooott
    option to quickly obtain information on the screen's root window.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --hheellpp
        Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.

    --iidd id
        This option allows the user to specify a target window id on the
        command line rather than using the mouse to select the target window.
        This is very useful in debugging X applications where the target
        window is not mapped to the screen or where the use of the mouse might
        be impossible or interfere with the application.

    --nnaammee name
        This option allows the user to specify that the window named name is
        the target window on the command line rather than using the mouse to
        select the target window.

    --rroooott
        This option specifies that X's root window is the target window. This
        is useful in situations where the root window is completely obscured.

    --iinntt
        This option specifies that all X window ids should be displayed as
        integer values. The default is to display them as hexadecimal values.

    --cchhiillddrreenn
        This option causes the root, parent, and children windows' ids and
        names of the selected window to be displayed.

    --ttrreeee
        This option is like --cchhiillddrreenn but displays all children recursively.

    --ssttaattss
        This option causes the display of various attributes pertaining to the
        location and appearance of the selected window. Information displayed
        includes the location of the window, its width and height, its depth,
        border width, class, colormap id if any, map state, backing-store
        hint, and location of the corners.

    --bbiittss
        This option causes the display of various attributes pertaining to the
        selected window's raw bits and how the selected window is to be
        stored. Displayed information includes the selected window's bit
        gravity, window gravity, backing-store hint, backing-planes value,
        backing pixel, and whether or not the window has save-under set.

    --eevveennttss
        This option causes the selected window's event masks to be displayed.
        Both the event mask of events wanted by some client and the event mask
        of events not to propagate are displayed.

    --ssiizzee
        This option causes the selected window's sizing hints to be displayed.
        Displayed information includes: for both the normal size hints and the
        zoom size hints, the user supplied location if any; the program
        supplied location if any; the user supplied size if any; the program
        supplied size if any; the minimum size if any; the maximum size if
        any; the resize increments if any; and the minimum and maximum aspect
        ratios if any.

    --wwmm
        This option causes the selected window's window manager hints to be
        displayed. Information displayed may include whether or not the
        application accepts input, what the window's icon window # and name
        is, where the window's icon should go, and what the window's initial
        state should be.

    --sshhaappee
        This option causes the selected window's window and border shape
        extents to be displayed.

    --ffrraammee
        This option causes window manager frames to be considered when
        manually selecting windows.

    --mmeettrriicc
        This option causes all individual height, width, and x and y positions
        to be displayed in millimeters as well as number of pixels, based on
        what the server thinks the resolution is. Geometry specifications that
        are in ++xx++yy form are not changed.

    --eenngglliisshh
        This option causes all individual height, width, and x and y positions
        to be displayed in inches (and feet, yards, and miles if necessary) as
        well as number of pixels. --mmeettrriicc and --eenngglliisshh may both be enabled at
        the same time.

    --aallll
        This option is a quick way to ask for all information possible.

    --ddiissppllaayy display
        This option allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
        _X(5X11R5).

  BBUUGGSS

    Using --ssttaattss --bbiittss shows some redundant information.

    The -geometry string displayed must make assumptions about the window's
    border width and the behavior of the application and the window manager.
    As a result, the location given is not always correct.
