    The xhost program is used to add and delete host names or user names to
    the list allowed to make connections to the X server. In the case of
    hosts, this provides a rudimentary form of privacy control and security.
    It is only sufficient for a workstation (single user) environment,
    although it does limit the worst abuses. Environments which require more
    sophisticated measures should implement the user-based mechanism or use
    the hooks in the protocol for passing other authentication data to the
    server.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    Xhost accepts the following command line options described below. For
    security, the options that effect access control may only be run from the
    "controlling host". For workstations, this is the same machine as the
    server. For X terminals, it is the login host.

    --hheellpp
        Prints a usage message.
    [[++]]name
        The given name (the plus sign is optional) is added to the list
        allowed to connect to the X server. The name can be a host name or a
        user name.
    --name
        The given name is removed from the list of allowed to connect to the
        server. The name can be a host name or a user name. Existing
        connections are not broken, but new connection attempts will be
        denied. Note that the current machine is allowed to be removed;
        however, further connections (including attempts to add it back) will
        not be permitted. Resetting the server (thereby breaking all
        connections) is the only way to allow local connections again.

    ++
        Access is granted to everyone, even if they aren't on the list (i.e.,
        access control is turned off).

    --
        Access is restricted to only those on the list (i.e., access control
        is turned on).

    nothing
        If no command line arguments are given, a message indicating whether
        or not access control is currently enabled is printed, followed by the
        list of those allowed to connect. This is the only option that may be
        used from machines other than the controlling host.

  NNAAMMEESS

    A complete name has the syntax "family:name" where the families are as
    follows:

    inet      Internet host
    dnet      DECnet host
    nis       Secure RPC network name
    krb       Kerberos V5 principal
    local     contains only one name, the empty string

    The family is case insensitive. The format of the name varies with the
    family.

    When Secure RPC is being used, the network independent netname (e.g.,
    "nis:unix.uid@domainname") can be specified, or a local user can be
    specified with just the username and a trailing at-sign (e.g., "nis:
    pat@").

    For backward compatibility with pre-R6 xhost, names that contain an at-
    sign (@) are assumed to be in the nis family. Otherwise the inet family is
    assumed.

    For each name added to the access control list, a line of the form "name
    being added to access control list" is printed. For each name removed from
    the access control list, a line of the form "name being removed from
    access control list" is printed.

  BBUUGGSS

    You can't specify a display on the command line because --ddiissppllaayy is a
    valid command line argument (indicating that you want to remove the
    machine named "display" from the access list).

    The X server stores network addresses, not host names. This is not really
    a bug. If somehow you change a host's network address while the server is
    still running, xhost must be used to add the new address and/or remove the
    old address.
