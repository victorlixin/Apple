    Xkill is a utility for forcing the X server to close connections to
    clients. This program is very dangerous, but is useful for aborting
    programs that have displayed undesired windows on a user's screen. If no
    resource identifier is given with -id, xkill will display a special cursor
    as a prompt for the user to select a window to be killed. If a pointer
    button is pressed over a non-root window, the server will close its
    connection to the client that created the window.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    --ddiissppllaayy displayname
        This option specifies the name of the X server to contact.
    --iidd resource
        This option specifies the X identifier for the resource whose creator
        is to be aborted. If no resource is specified, xkill will display a
        special cursor with which you should select a window to be kill.
    --bbuuttttoonn number
        This option specifies the number of pointer button that should be used
        in selecting a window to kill. If the word "any" is specified, any
        button on the pointer may be used. By default, the first button in the
        pointer map (which is usually the leftmost button) is used.

    --aallll
        This option indicates that all clients with top-level windows on the
        screen should be killed. Xkill will ask you to select the root window
        with each of the currently defined buttons to give you several chances
        to abort. Use of this option is highly discouraged.

    --ffrraammee
        This option indicates that xkill should ignore the standard
        conventions for finding top-level client windows (which are typically
        nested inside a window manager window), and simply believe that you
        want to kill direct children of the root.

    BBuuttttoonn
        Specifies a specific pointer button number or the word "any" to use
        when selecting windows.
