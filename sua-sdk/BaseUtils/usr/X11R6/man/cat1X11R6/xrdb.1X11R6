    Xrdb is used to get or set the contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER property
    on the root window of screen 0, or the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the
    root window of any or all screens, or everything combined. You would
    normally run this program from your X startup file.

    Most X clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to
    get user preferences about color, fonts, and so on for applications.
    Having this information in the server (where it is available to all
    clients) instead of on disk, solves the problem in previous versions of X
    that required you to maintain defaults files on every machine that you
    might use. It also allows for dynamic changing of defaults without editing
    files.

    The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is used for resources that apply to all
    screens of the display. The SCREEN_RESOURCES property on each screen
    specifies additional (or overriding) resources to be used for that screen.
    (When there is only one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally not used, all
    resources are just placed in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.)

    The file specified by filename (or the contents from standard input if -
    or no filename is given) is optionally passed through the C preprocessor
    with the following symbols defined, based on the capabilities of the
    server being used:
    SSEERRVVEERRHHOOSSTT==hostname
        the hostname portion of the display to which you are connected.
    SSRRVVRR__name
        the SERVERHOST hostname string turned into a legal identifier. For
        example, "my-dpy.lcs.mit.edu" becomes SRVR_my_dpy_lcs_mit_edu.
    HHOOSSTT==hostname
        the same as SSEERRVVEERRHHOOSSTT.
    DDIISSPPLLAAYY__NNUUMM==num
        the number of the display on the server host.
    CCLLIIEENNTTHHOOSSTT==hostname
        the name of the host on which xrdb is running.
    CCLLNNTT__name
        the CLIENTHOST hostname string turned into a legal identifier. For
        example, "expo.lcs.mit.edu" becomes CLNT_expo_lcs_mit_edu.
    RREELLEEAASSEE==num
        the vendor release number for the server. The interpretation of this
        number will vary depending on VENDOR.
    RREEVVIISSIIOONN==num
        the X protocol minor version supported by this server (currently 0).
    VVEERRSSIIOONN==num
        the X protocol major version supported by this server (should always
        be 11).
    VVEENNDDOORR==vendor
        a string literal specifying the vendor of the server.
    VVNNDDRR__name
        the VENDOR name string turned into a legal identifier. For example,
        "MIT X Consortium" becomes VNDR_MIT_X_Consortium.
    EEXXTT__name
        A symbol is defined for each protocol extension supported by the
        server. Each extension string name is turned into a legal identifier.
        For example, "X3D-PEX" becomes EXT_X3D_PEX.
    NNUUMM__SSCCRREEEENNSS==num
        the total number of screens.
    SSCCRREEEENN__NNUUMM==num
        the number of the current screen (from zero).
    BBIITTSS__PPEERR__RRGGBB==num
        the number of significant bits in an RGB color specification. This is
        the log base 2 of the number of distinct shades of each primary that
        the hardware can generate. Note that it usually is not related to
        PLANES.
    CCLLAASSSS==visualclass
        one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor,
        DirectColor. This is the visual class of the root window.
    CCLLAASSSS__visualclass=visualid
        the visual class of the root window in a form you can #ifdef on. The
        value is the numeric id of the visual.

    CCOOLLOORR
        defined only if CLASS is one of StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor,
        or DirectColor.
    CCLLAASSSS__visualclass_depth=num
        A symbol is defined for each visual supported for the screen. The
        symbol includes the class of the visual and its depth; the value is
        the numeric id of the visual. (If more than one visual has the same
        class and depth, the numeric id of the first one reported by the
        server is used.)
    HHEEIIGGHHTT==num
        the height of the root window in pixels.
    WWIIDDTTHH==num
        the width of the root window in pixels.
    PPLLAANNEESS==num
        the number of bit planes (the depth) of the root window.
    XX__RREESSOOLLUUTTIIOONN==num
        the x resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.
    YY__RREESSOOLLUUTTIIOONN==num
        the y resolution of the screen in pixels per meter.

    SRVR_name, CLNT_name, VNDR_name, and EXT_name identifiers are formed by
    changing all characters other than letters and digits into underscores
    (_).

    Lines that begin with an exclamation mark (!) are ignored and may be used
    as comments.

    Note that since xrdb can read from standard input, it can be used to the
    change the contents of properties directly from a terminal or from a shell
    script.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    xrdb program accepts the following options:

    --hheellpp
        This option (or any unsupported option) will cause a brief description
        of the allowable options and parameters to be printed.
    --ddiissppllaayy display
        This option specifies the X server to be used; see _X(5X11R5). It also
        specifies the screen to use for the -screen option, and it specifies
        the screen from which preprocessor symbols are derived for the -global
        option.

    --aallll
        This option indicates that operation should be performed on the
        screen-independent resource property (RESOURCE_MANAGER), as well as
        the screen-specific property (SCREEN_RESOURCES) on every screen of the
        display. For example, when used in conjunction with -query, the
        contents of all properties are output. For -load, -override and -
        merge, the input file is processed once for each screen. The resources
        which occur in common in the output for every screen are collected,
        and these are applied as the screen-independent resources. The
        remaining resources are applied for each individual per-screen
        property. This the default mode of operation.

    --gglloobbaall
        This option indicates that the operation should only be performed on
        the screen-independent RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

    --ssccrreeeenn
        This option indicates that the operation should only be performed on
        the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of the default screen of the display.

    --ssccrreeeennss
        This option indicates that the operation should be performed on the
        SCREEN_RESOURCES property of each screen of the display. For -load, -
        override and -merge, the input file is processed for each screen.

    --nn
        This option indicates that changes to the specified properties (when
        used with -load, -override or -merge) or to the resource file (when
        used with -edit) should be shown on the standard output, but should
        not be performed.

    --qquuiieett
        This option indicates that warning about duplicate entries should not
        be displayed.
    --ccpppp filename
        This option specifies the pathname of the C preprocessor program to be
        used. Although xrdb was designed to use CPP, any program that acts as
        a filter and accepts the -D, -I, and -U options may be used.

    --nnooccpppp
        This option indicates that xrdb should not run the input file through
        a preprocessor before loading it into properties.

    --ssyymmbboollss
        This option indicates that the symbols that are defined for the
        preprocessor should be printed onto the standard output.

    --qquueerryy
        This option indicates that the current contents of the specified
        properties should be printed onto the standard output. Note that since
        preprocessor commands in the input resource file are part of the input
        file, not part of the property, they won't appear in the output from
        this option. The --eeddiitt option can be used to merge the contents of
        properties back into the input resource file without damaging
        preprocessor commands.

    --llooaadd
        This option indicates that the input should be loaded as the new value
        of the specified properties, replacing whatever was there (i.e. the
        old contents are removed). This is the default action.

    --oovveerrrriiddee
        This option indicates that the input should be added to, instead of
        replacing, the current contents of the specified properties. New
        entries override previous entries.

    --mmeerrggee
        This option indicates that the input should be merged and
        lexicographically sorted with, instead of replacing, the current
        contents of the specified properties.

    --rreemmoovvee
        This option indicates that the specified properties should be removed
        from the server.

    --rreettaaiinn
        This option indicates that the server should be instructed not to
        reset if xrdb is the first client. This never be necessary under
        normal conditions, since xdm and xinit always act as the first client.
    --eeddiitt filename
        This option indicates that the contents of the specified properties
        should be edited into the given file, replacing any values already
        listed there. This allows you to put changes that you have made to
        your defaults back into your resource file, preserving any comments or
        preprocessor lines.
    --bbaacckkuupp string
        This option specifies a suffix to be appended to the filename used
        with --eeddiitt to generate a backup file.
    --DDname[=value]
        This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to
        define symbols for use with conditionals such as
    --UUname
        This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to
        remove any definitions of this symbol.
    --IIdirectory
        This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to
        specify a directory to search for files that are referenced with
        #include.
