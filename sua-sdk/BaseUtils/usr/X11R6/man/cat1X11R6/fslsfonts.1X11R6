    fslsfonts - list fonts served by X font server

    fslsfonts [[-options......]] [[-fn pattern]]

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    Fslsfonts lists the fonts that match the given pattern. The wildcard
    character "*" may be used to match any sequence of characters (including
    none), and "?" to match any single character. If no pattern is given, "*"
    is assumed.

    The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted to prevent them from being
    expanded by the shell.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --sseerrvveerr host:port
        This option specifies the X font server to contact.

    --ll
        Lists some attributes of the font on one line in addition to its name.

    --llll
        Lists font properties in addition to --ll output.

    --llllll
        Supported for compatibility with xlsfonts, but output is the same as
        for --llll.

    --mm
        This option indicates that long listings should also print the minimum
        and maximum bounds of each font.

    --CC
        This option indicates that listings should use multiple columns. This
        is the same as --nn 00.

    --11
        This option indicates that listings should use a single column. This
        is the same as --nn 11.
    --ww width
        This option specifies the width in characters that should be used in
        figuring out how many columns to print. The default is 79.
    --nn columns
        This option specifies the number of columns to use in displaying the
        output. The default is 0, which will attempt to fit as many columns of
        font names into the number of character specified by --ww width.

    --uu
        This option indicates that the output should be left unsorted.

  BBUUGGSS

    Doing "fslsfonts -l" can tie up your server for a very long time. This is
    really a bug with single-threaded non-preemptable servers, not with this
    program.
