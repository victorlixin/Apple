    Xwd is an X Window System window dumping utility. Xwd allows X users to
    store window images in a specially formatted dump file. This file can then
    be read by various other X utilities for redisplay, printing, editing,
    formatting, archiving, image processing, etc. The target window is
    selected by clicking the pointer in the desired window. The keyboard bell
    is rung once at the beginning of the dump and twice when the dump is
    completed.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --ddiissppllaayy display
        This argument allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
        _X(5X11R5).

    --hheellpp
        Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.

    --nnoobbddrrss
        This argument specifies that the window dump should not include the
        pixels that compose the X window border. This is useful in situations
        where you may wish to include the window contents in a document as an
        illustration.

    --oouutt file
        This argument allows the user to explicitly specify the output file on
        the command line. The default is to output to standard out.

    --xxyy
        This option applies to color displays only. It selects `XY' format
        dumping instead of the default `Z' format.

    --aadddd value
        This option specifies an signed value to be added to every pixel.

    --ffrraammee
        This option indicates that the window manager frame should be included
        when manually selecting a window.

    --rroooott
        This option indicates that the root window should be selected for the
        window dump, without requiring the user to select a window with the
        pointer.

    --iidd id
        This option indicates that the window with the specified resource id
        should be selected for the window dump, without requiring the user to
        select a window with the pointer.

    --nnaammee name
        This option indicates that the window with the specified WM_NAME
        property should be selected for the window dump, without requiring the
        user to select a window with the pointer.

    --iiccmmaapp
        Normally the colormap of the chosen window is used to obtain RGB
        values. This option forces the first installed colormap of the screen
        to be used instead.

    --ssccrreeeenn
        This option indicates that the GetImage request used to obtain the
        image should be done on the root window, rather than directly on the
        specified window. In this way, you can obtain pieces of other windows
        that overlap the specified window, and more importantly, you can
        capture menus or other popups that are independent windows but appear
        over the specified window.

    --ssiilleenntt
        Operate silently, i.e. don't ring any bells before and after dumping
        the window.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    DDIISSPPLLAAYY
        To get default host and display number.

  FFIILLEESS
