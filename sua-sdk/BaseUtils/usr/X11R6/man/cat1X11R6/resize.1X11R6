    Resize prints a shell command for setting the TERM and TERMCAP environment
    variables to indicate the current size of xterm window from which the
    command is run. For this output to take effect, resize must either be
    evaluated as part of the command line (usually done with a shell alias or
    function) or else redirected to a file which can then be read in. From the
    C shell (usually known as /bin/csh), the following alias could be defined
    in the user's .cshrc:

            %  alias rs 'set noglob; eval `resize`'

    After resizing the window, the user would type:

            %  rs

    Users of versions of the Bourne shell (usually known as /bin/sh) that
    don't have command functions will need to send the output to a temporary
    file and the read it back in with the "." command:

            $  resize > /tmp/out
            $  . /tmp/out

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The following options may be used with resize:

    --uu
        This option indicates that Bourne shell commands should be generated
        even if the user's current shell isn't /bin/sh.

    --cc
        This option indicates that C shell commands should be generated even
        if the user's current shell isn't /bin/csh.
    --ss [rows columns]
        This option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be used
        instead of the special xterm escape code. If rows and columns are
        given, resize will ask the xterm to resize itself. However, the window
        manager may choose to disallow the change.
