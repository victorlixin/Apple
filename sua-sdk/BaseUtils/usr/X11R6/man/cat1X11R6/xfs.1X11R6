    Xfs is the X Window System font server. It supplies fonts to X Window
    System display servers.

    The server is usually run by a system administrator, and started via boot
    files like /etc/rc.local. Users may also wish to start private font
    servers for specific sets of fonts.

    --ccoonnffiigg ccoonnffiigguurraattiioonn__ffiillee
        Specifies the configuration file the font server will use.

    --llss lliisstteenn--ssoocckkeett
        Specifies a file descriptor which is already set up to be used as the
        listen socket. This option is only intended to be used by the font
        server itself when automatically spawning another copy of itself to
        handle additional connections.

    --ppoorrtt ttccpp__ppoorrtt
        Specifies the TCP port number on which the server will listen for
        connections. The default port number is 7100.

    SIGTERM
        This causes the font server to exit cleanly.

    SIGUSR1
        This signal is used to cause the server to re-read its configuration
        file.

    SIGUSR2
        This signal is used to cause the server to flush any cached data it
        may have.

    SIGHUP
        This signal is used to cause the server to reset, closing all active
        connections and re-reading the configuration file.

    The configuration language is a list of keyword and value pairs. Each
    keyword is followed by an '=' and then the desired value.

    Recognized keywords include:

    catalogue (list of string)
        Ordered list of font path element names. Use of the keyword
        "catalogue" is very misleading at present, the current implementation
        only supports a single catalogue ("all"), containing all of the
        specified fonts.

    alternate-servers (list of string)
        List of alternate servers for this font server.

    client-limit (cardinal)
        Number of clients this font server will support before refusing
        service. This is useful for tuning the load on each individual font
        server.

    clone-self (boolean)
        Whether this font server should attempt to clone itself when it reachs
        the client-limit.

    default-point-size (cardinal)
        The default pointsize (in decipoints) for fonts that don't specify.
        The default is 120.

    default-resolutions (list of resolutions)
        Resolutions the server supports by default. This information may be
        used as a hint for pre-rendering, and substituted for scaled fonts
        which do not specify a resolution. A resolution is a comma-separated
        pair of x and y resolutions in pixels per inch. Multiple resolutions
        are separated by commas.

    error-file (string)
        Filename of the error file. All warnings and errors will be logged
        here.

    port (cardinal)
        TCP port on which the server will listen for connections.

    use-syslog (boolean)
        Whether _ss_yy_ss_ll_oo_gg(3) (on supported systems) is to be used for errors.

    deferglyphs (string)
        Set the mode for delayed fetching and caching of glyphs. Value is
        "none", meaning deferred glyphs is disabled, "all", meaning it is
        enabled for all fonts, and "16", meaning it is enabled only for 16-
        bits fonts.

    One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that accepts
    TCP connections:

        tcp/hostname:port
        tcp/hostname:port/cataloguelist

    The hostname specifies the name (or decimal numeric address) of the
    machine on which the font server is running. The port is the decimal TCP
    port on which the font server is listening for connections. The
    cataloguelist specifies a list of catalogue names, with '+' as a
    separator.

    Examples: tcp/fs.x.org:7100, tcp/18.30.0.212:7101/all.

    One of the following forms can be used to name a font server that accepts
    DECnet connections:

        decnet/nodename::font$objname
        decnet/nodename::font$objname/cataloguelist

    The nodename specifies the name (or decimal numeric address) of the
    machine on which the font server is running. The objname is a normal,
    case-insensitive DECnet object name. The cataloguelist specifies a list of
    catalogue names, with '+' as a separator.

    Examples: DECnet/SRVNOD::FONT$DEFAULT, decnet/44.70::font$special/symbols.
