    xcmsdb is used to load, query, or remove Device Color Characterization
    data stored in properties on the root window of the screen as specified in
    section 7, Device Color Characterization, of the ICCCM. Device Color
    Characterization data (also called the Device Profile) is an integral part
    of Xlib's X Color Management System (Xcms), necessary for proper
    conversion of color specification between device-independent and device-
    dependent forms. Xcms uses 3x3 matrices stored in the
    XDCCC_LINEAR_RGB_MATRICES property to convert color specifications between
    CIEXYZ and RGB Intensity (XcmsRGBi, also referred to as linear RGB). Xcms
    then uses display gamma information stored in the
    XDCCC_LINEAR_RGB_CORRECTION property to convert color specifications
    between RGBi and RGB device (XcmsRGB, also referred to as device RGB).

    Note that Xcms allows clients to register function sets in addition to its
    built-in function set for CRT color monitors. Additional function sets may
    store their device profile information in other properties in function set
    specific format. This utility is unaware of these non-standard properties.

    The ASCII readable contents of filename (or the standard input if no input
    file is given) are appropriately transformed for storage in properties,
    provided the --qquueerryy or --rreemmoovvee options are not specified.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    xcmsdb program accepts the following options:

    --qquueerryy
        This option attempts to read the XDCCC properties off the screen's
        root window. If successful, it transforms the data into a more
        readable format, then sends the data to standard out.

    --rreemmoovvee
        This option attempts to remove the XDCCC properties on the screen's
        root window.
    --ffoorrmmaatt 3322|1166|88
        Specifies the property format (32, 16, or 8 bits per entry) for the
        XDCCC_LINEAR_RGB_CORRECTION property. Precision of encoded floating
        point values increases with the increase in bits per entry. The
        default is 32 bits per entry.
