    The iceauth program is used to edit and display the authorization
    information used in connecting with ICE. This program is usually used to
    extract authorization records from one machine and merge them in on
    another (as is the case when using remote logins or granting access to
    other users). Commands (described below) may be entered interactively, on
    the iceauth command line, or in scripts.
