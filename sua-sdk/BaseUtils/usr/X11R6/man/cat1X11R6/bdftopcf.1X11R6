    Bdftopcf

    is a font compiler for the X server and font server. Fonts in Portable
    Compiled Format can be read by any architecture, although the file is
    structured to allow one particular architecture to read them directly
    without reformatting. This allows fast reading on the appropriate machine,
    but the files are still portable (but read more slowly) on other machines.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    --ppn
        Sets the font glyph padding. Each glyph in the font will have each
        scanline padded in to a multiple of n bytes, where n is 1, 2, 4 or 8.
    --uun
        Sets the font scanline unit. When the font bit order is different from
        the font byte order, the scanline unit n describes what unit of data
        (in bytes) are to be swapped; the unit i can be 1, 2 or 4 bytes.

    --mm
        Sets the font bit order to MSB (most significant bit) first. Bits for
        each glyph will be placed in this order; i.e., the left most bit on
        the screen will be in the highest valued bit in each unit.

    --ll
        Sets the font bit order to LSB (least significant bit) first. The left
        most bit on the screen will be in the lowest valued bit in each unit.

    --MM
        Sets the font byte order to MSB first. All multi-byte data in the file
        (metrics, bitmaps and everything else) will be written most
        significant byte first.

    --LL
        Sets the font byte order to LSB first. All multi-byte data in the file
        (metrics, bitmaps and everything else) will be written least
        significant byte first.

    --tt
        When this option is specified, bdftopcf will convert fonts into
        "terminal" fonts when possible. A terminal font has each glyph image
        padded to the same size; the X server can usually render these types
        of fonts more quickly.

    --ii
        This option inhibits the normal computation of ink metrics. When a
        font has glyph images which do not fill the bitmap image (i.e., the
        "on" pixels don't extend to the edges of the metrics) bdftopcf
        computes the actual ink metrics and places them in the .pcf file; the
        -t option inhibits this behaviour.
    --oo output-file-name
        By default bdftopcf writes the pcf file to standard output; this
        option gives the name of a file to be used instead.
