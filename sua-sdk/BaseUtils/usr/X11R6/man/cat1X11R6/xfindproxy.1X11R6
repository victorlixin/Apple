    xxffiinnddpprrooxxyy is a program used to locate available proxy services. It
    utilizes the Proxy Management Protocol to communicate with a proxy
    manager. The proxy manager keeps track of all available proxy services,
    starts new proxies when necessary, and makes sure that proxies are shared
    whenever possible.

    The --mmaannaaggeerr argument is required, and it specifies the network address of
    the proxy manager. The format of the address is a standard ICE network id
    (for example, "tcp/blah.x.org:6500").

    The --nnaammee argument is required, and it specifies the name of the desired
    proxy service (for example, "LBX"). The name is case insensitive.

    The --sseerrvveerr argument is also required, and it specifies the address of the
    target server. The format of the address is specific to the proxy service
    specified with the -name argument. For example, for a proxy service of
    "LBX", the address would be an X display address (e.g, "blah.x.org:0").

    The --aauutthh argument is optional. If specified, xfindproxy will read 2 lines
    from standard input. The first line is an authorization/authentication
    name. The second line is the authorization/authentication data in
    hexadecimal format (the same format used by xauth). xfindproxy will pass
    this auth data to the proxy, and in most cases, will be used by the proxy
    to authorize/authenticate itself to the target server.

    The --hhoosstt argument is optional. If xfindproxy starts a new proxy service,
    it will pass the host specified. The proxy may choose to restrict all
    connections to this host. In the event that xfindproxy locates an already
    existing proxy, the host will be passed, but the semantics of how the
    proxy uses this host are undefined.

    The --ooppttiioonnss argument is optional. If xfindproxy starts a new proxy
    service, it will pass any options specified. The semantics of the options
    are specific to each proxy server and are not defined here. In the event
    that xfindproxy locates an already existing proxy, the options will be
    passed, but the semantics of how the proxy uses these options are
    undefined.

    If xfindproxy is successful in obtaining a proxy address, it will print it
    to stdout. The format of the proxy address is specific to the proxy
    service being used. For example, for a proxy service of "LBX", the proxy
    address would be the X display address of the proxy (e.g, "blah.x.org:
    63").

    If xfindproxy is unsuccessful in obtaining a proxy address, it will print
    an error to stderr.
