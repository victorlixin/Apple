    The xcutsel program is used to copy the current selection into a cut
    buffer and to make a selection that contains the current contents of the
    cut buffer. It acts as a bridge between applications that don't support
    selections and those that do.

    By default, xcutsel will use the selection named PRIMARY and the cut
    buffer CUT_BUFFER0. Either or both of these can be overridden by command
    line arguments or by resources.

    An xcutsel window has the following buttons:

    quit
        When this button is pressed, xcutsel exits. Any selections held by
        xcutsel are automatically released.

    copy PRIMARY to 0
        When this button is pressed, xcutsel copies the current selection into
        the cut buffer.

    copy 0 to PRIMARY
        When this button is pressed, xcutsel converts the current contents of
        the cut buffer into the selection.

    The button labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer selected by command
    line options or through the resource database.

    When the "copy 0 to PRIMARY" button is activated, the button will remain
    inverted as long as xcutsel remains the owner of the selection. This
    serves to remind you which client owns the current selection. Note that
    the value of the selection remains constant; if the cutbuffer is changed,
    you must again activate the copy button to retrieve the new value when
    desired.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    Xcutsel accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options as well
    as the following:
    --sseelleeccttiioonn name
        This option specifies the name of the selection to use. The default is
        PRIMARY. The only supported abbreviations for this option are "-
        select", "-sel" and "-s", as the standard toolkit option "-
        selectionTimeout" has a similar name.
    --ccuuttbbuuffffeerr number
        This option specifies the cut buffer to use. The default is cut buffer
        0.

  XX DDEEFFAAUULLTTSS

    This program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit resource names and
    classes as well as:
    sseelleeccttiioonn ((class SSeelleeccttiioonn))
        This resource specifies the name of the selection to use. The default
        is PRIMARY.
    ccuuttBBuuffffeerr ((class CCuuttBBuuffffeerr))
        This resource specifies the number of the cut buffer to use. The
        default is 0.

  WWIIDDGGEETT NNAAMMEESS

    The following instance names may be used when user configuration of the
    labels in them is desired:
    sseell--ccuutt ((class CCoommmmaanndd))
        This is the "copy SELECTION to BUFFER" button.
    ccuutt--sseell ((class CCoommmmaanndd))
        This is the "copy BUFFER to SELECTION" button.
    qquuiitt ((class CCoommmmaanndd))
        This is the "quit" button.

    There is no way to change the name of the selection or the number of the
    cut buffer while the program is running.
