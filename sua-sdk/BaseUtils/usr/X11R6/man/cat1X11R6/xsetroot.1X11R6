    The setroot program allows you to tailor the appearance of the background
    ("root") window on a workstation display running X. Normally, you
    experiment with xsetroot until you find a personalized look that you like,
    then put the xsetroot command that produces it into your X startup file.
    If no options are specified, or if -def is specified, the window is reset
    to its default state. The -def option can be specified along with other
    options and only the non-specified characteristics will be reset to the
    default state.

    Only one of the background color/tiling changing options (-solid, -gray, -
    grey, -bitmap, and -mod) may be specified at a time.

    The various options are as follows:

    --hheellpp
        Print a usage message and exit.

    --ddeeff
        Reset unspecified attributes to the default values. (Restores the
        background to the familiar gray mesh and the cursor to the hollow x
        shape.)
    --ccuurrssoorr cursorfile maskfile
        This lets you change the pointer cursor to whatever you want when the
        pointer cursor is outside of any window. Cursor and mask files are
        bitmaps (little pictures), and can be made with the _bb_ii_tt_mm_aa_pp(1X11R6)
        program. You probably want the mask file to be all black until you get
        used to the way masks work.
    --ccuurrssoorr__nnaammee cursorname
        This lets you change the pointer cursor to one of the standard cursors
        from the cursor font. Refer to appendix B of the X protocol for the
        names (except that the XC_ prefix is elided for this option).
    --bbiittmmaapp filename
        Use the bitmap specified in the file to set the window pattern. You
        can make your own bitmap files (little pictures) using the
        _bb_ii_tt_mm_aa_pp(1X11R6) program. The entire background will be made up of
        repeated "tiles" of the bitmap.
    --mmoodd x y
        This is used if you want a plaid-like grid pattern on your screen. x
        and y are integers ranging from 1 to 16. Try the different
        combinations. Zero and negative numbers are taken as 1.

    --ggrraayy
        Make the entire background gray. (Easier on the eyes.)

    --ggrreeyy
        Make the entire background grey.
    --ffgg color
        Use "color" as the foreground color. Foreground and background colors
        are meaningful only in combination with -cursor, -bitmap, or -mod.
    --bbgg color
        Use "color" as the background color.

    --rrvv
        This exchanges the foreground and background colors. Normally the
        foreground color is black and the background color is white.
    --ssoolliidd color
        This sets the background of the root window to the specified color.
        This option is only useful on color servers.
    --nnaammee string
        Set the name of the root window to "string". There is no default
        value. Usually a name is assigned to a window so that the window
        manager can use a text representation when the window is iconified.
        This option is unused since you can't iconify the background.
    --ddiissppllaayy display
        Specifies the server to connect to; see _X(5X11R5).
