    Applications that would like to take advantage of the Low Bandwidth
    extension to X (LBX) must make their connections to an lbxproxy. These
    applications need to know nothing about LBX, they simply connect to the
    lbxproxy as if were a regular server. The lbxproxy accepts client
    connections, multiplexes them over a single connection to the X server,
    and performs various optimizations on the X protocol to make it faster
    over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections.

    With regard to authentication/authorization, lbxproxy simply passes along
    to the server the credentials presented by the client. Since X clients
    will connect to lbxproxy, it is important that the user's .Xauthority file
    contain entries with valid keys associated with the network ID of the
    proxy. lbxproxy does not get involved with how these entries are added to
    the .Xauthority file. The user is responsible for setting it up.

    The lbxproxy program has various options, all of which are optional.

    If ::ll is specified, the proxy will use the given display port when
    listening for connections. The display port is an offset from port 6000,
    identical to the way in which regular X display connections are specified.
    If no port is specified on the command line option, lbxproxy will default
    to port 63. If the port number that the proxy tries to listen on is in
    use, the proxy will attempt to use another port number. If the proxy is
    not using the Proxy Manager and the default port number cannot be used,
    the port number that is used will be written to stderr.

    The other command line options that can be specified are:

    --hheellpp
        Prints a brief help message about the command line options.
    --ddiissppllaayy dpy
        Specifies the address of the X server supporting the LBX extension. If
        this option is not specified, the display is obtained by the DISPLAY
        environment variable.
    --mmoottiioonn count
        A limited number of pointer motion events are allowed to be in flight
        between the server and the proxy at any given time. The maximimum
        number of motion events that can be in flight is set with this option;
        the default is 8.
    --mmaaxxsseerrvveerrss number
        The default behavior of lbxproxy is to manage a single server.
        However, lbxproxy can manage more than one server. The default maximum
        number of servers is 20. The number of servers can be overridden by
        setting the environment variable LBXPROXY_MAXSERVERS to the desired
        number. The order of precedence from highest to lowest: command line,
        environment variable, default number.

    --[[tteerrmmiinnaattee||rreesseett]]
        The default behavior of lbxproxy is to continue running as usual when
        it's last client exits. The --tteerrmmiinnaattee option will cause lbxproxy to
        exit when the last client exits. The --rreesseett option will cause lbxproxy
        to reset itself when the last client exits. Resetting causes lbxproxy
        to clean up it's state and reconnect to the server.

    --rreeccoonnnneecctt
        The default behavior of lbxproxy is to exit when its connection to the
        server is broken. The --rreeccoonnnneecctt option will cause lbxproxy to just
        reset instead (see --rreesseett above) and attempt to reconnect to the
        server.

    --II
        Causes all remaining arguments to be ignored.

    --nnoollbbxx
        Disables all LBX optimizations.

    --nnooccoommpp
        Disables stream compression.

    --nnooddeellttaa
        Disables delta request substitutions.

    --nnoottaaggss
        Disables usage of tags.

    --nnooggffxx
        Disables reencoding of graphics requests (not including image related
        requests).

    --nnooiimmaaggee
        Disables image compression.

    --nnoossqquuiisshh
        Disables squishing of X events.

    --nnooiinntteerrnnsscc
        Disables short circuiting of InternAtom requests.

    --nnooaattoommssffiillee
        Disables reading of the atoms control file. See the section on "Atom
        Control" for more details.
    --aattoommssffiillee file
        Overrides the default AtomControl file. See the section on "Atom
        Control" for more details.

    --nnoowwiinnaattttrr
        Disables GetWindowAttributes/GetGeometry grouping into one round trip.

    --nnooggrraabbccmmaapp
        Disables colormap grabbing.

    --nnoorrggbbffiillee
        Disables color name to RGB resolution in proxy.
    --rrggbbffiillee path
        Specifies an alternate RGB database for color name to RGB resolution.

    --ttaaggccaacchheessiizzee
        Set the size of the proxy's tag cache (in bytes).
    --zzlleevveell level
        Set the Zlib compression level (used for stream compression).
        default is 6
        1 = worst compression, fastest
        9 = best compression, slowest

    --ccoommppssttaattss
        Report stream compression statistics every time the proxy resets or
        receives a SIGHUP signal.

    --nnoozzeerrooppaadd
        Don't zero out unused pad bytes in X requests, replies, and events.

    --cchheeaatteerrrroorrss
        Allows cheating on X protocol for the sake of improved performance.
        The X protocol guarantees that any replies, events or errors generated
        by a previous request will be sent before those of a later request.
        This puts substantial restrictions on when lbxproxy can short circuit
        a request. The -cheaterrors option allows lbxproxy to violate X
        protocol rules with respect to errors. Use at your own risk.

    --cchheeaatteevveennttss
        The -cheatevents option allows lbxproxy to violate X protocol rules
        with respect to events as well as errors. Use at your own risk.

  AATTOOMM CCOONNTTRROOLL

    At startup, lbxproxy "pre-interns" a configurable list of atoms. This
    allows lbxproxy to intern a group of atoms in a single round trip and
    immediately store the results in its cache.

    While running, lbxproxy uses heuristics to decide when to delay sending
    window property data to the server. The heuristics depend on the size of
    the data, the name of the property, and whether a window manager is
    running through the same lbxproxy.

    Atom control is specified in the "AtomControl" file, set up during
    installation of lbxproxy, with command line overrides.

    The file is a simple text file. There are three forms of lines: comments,
    length control, and name control. Lines starting with a '!' are treated as
    comments. A line of the form

    z length

    specifies the minimum length in bytes before property data will be
    delayed. A line of the form

    options atomname

    controls the given atom, where options is any combination of the following
    characters: 'i' means the atom should be pre-interned; and 'w' means data
    for properties with this name should be delayed only if a window manager
    is also running through the same lbxproxy.

  BBUUGGSS

    When the authorization protocol XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 is used:

    A client must be on the same host as lbxproxy for the client to be
    authorized to connect to the server.

    If a client is not on the same host as lbxproxy, the client will not be
    authorized to connect to the server.
