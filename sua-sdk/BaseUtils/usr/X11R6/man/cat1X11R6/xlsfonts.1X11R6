    xlsfonts - server font list displayer for X

    xlsfonts [[-options ......]] [-fn pattern]]

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    Xlsfonts lists the fonts that match the given pattern. The wildcard
    character "*" may be used to match any sequence of characters (including
    none), and "?" to match any single character. If no pattern is given, "*"
    is assumed.

    The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted to prevent them from being
    expanded by the shell.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --ddiissppllaayy host:dpy
        This option specifies the X server to contact.

    --ll
        Lists some attributes of the font on one line in addition to its name.

    --llll
        Lists font properties in addition to --ll output.

    --llllll
        Lists character metrics in addition to --llll output.

    --mm
        This option indicates that long listings should also print the minimum
        and maximum bounds of each font.

    --CC
        This option indicates that listings should use multiple columns. This
        is the same as --nn 00.

    --11
        This option indicates that listings should use a single column. This
        is the same as --nn 11.
    --ww width
        This option specifies the width in characters that should be used in
        figuring out how many columns to print. The default is 79.
    --nn columns
        This option specifies the number of columns to use in displaying the
        output. By default, it will attempt to fit as many columns of font
        names into the number of character specified by --ww width.

    --uu
        This option indicates that the output should be left unsorted.

    --oo
        This option indicates that xlsfonts should do an OOppeennFFoonntt (and
        QQuueerryyFFoonntt, if appropriate) rather than a LLiissttFFoonnttss. This is useful if
        LLiissttFFoonnttss or LLiissttFFoonnttssWWiitthhIInnffoo fail to list a known font (as is the
        case with some scaled font systems).
    --ffnn pattern
        This option specifies the font name pattern to match.

  BBUUGGSS

    Doing "xlsfonts -l" can tie up your server for a very long time. This is
    really a bug with single-threaded non-preemptable servers, not with this
    program.
