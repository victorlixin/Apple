    NOTE: The startx script supplied with the X11 distribution is a sample
    designed more as a base for customization than as a finished product. Site
    administrators are urged to customize it for their site. And to update
    this manual page when they do!

    The startx script is a front end to xinit that provides a somewhat nicer
    user interface for running a single session of the X Window System. It is
    typically run with no arguments.

    To determine the client to run, startx first looks for a file called
    .xinitrc in the user's home directory. If that is not found, it uses the
    file xinitrc in the xinit library directory. If command line client
    options are given, they override this behavior. To determine the server to
    run, startx first looks for a file called .xserverrc in the user's home
    directory. If that is not found, it uses the file xserverrc in the xinit
    library directory. If command line server options are given, they override
    this behavior. Users rarely need to provide a .xserverrc file. See the
    xxiinniitt manual page for more details on the arguments.

    The .xinitrc is typically a shell script which starts many clients
    according to the user's preference. When this shell script exits, startx
    kills the server and performs any other session shutdown needed. Most of
    the clients started by .xinitrc should be run in the background. The last
    client should run in the foreground; when it exits, the session will exit.
    People often choose a session manager, window manager, or xterm as the
    "magic" client.

    Below is a sample .xinitrc that starts several applications and leaves the
    window manager running as the "last" application. Assuming that the window
    manager has been configured properly, the user then chooses the "Exit"
    menu item to shut down X.

    DISPLAY
        This variable gets set to the name of the display to which clients
        should connect. Note that this gets set, not read.

  FFIILLEESS

    $(HOME)/.xinitrc
        Client to run. Typically a shell script which runs many programs in
        the background.

    $(HOME)/.xserverrc
        Server to run. The default is X.

    <XRoot>/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc
        Client to run if the user has no .xinitrc file. <XRoot> refers to the
        root of the X11 install tree.

    <XRoot>/lib/X11/xinit/xserverrc
        Client to run if the user has no .xserverrc file. This is only needed
        if the server needs special arguments or is not named. <XRoot> refers
        to the root of the X11 install tree.
