    Xon runs the specified command (default xterm -ls) on the remote machine
    using rsh, remsh, or rcmd. Xon passes the DISPLAY, XAUTHORITY and
    XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variables to the remote command.

    When no command is specified, xon runs 'xterm -ls'. It additionally
    specifies the application name to be 'xterm-remote-host' and the window
    title to be '-fIremote-host'.

    Xon can only work when the remote host will allow you to log in without a
    password, by having an entry in the .rhosts file permitting access.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    Note that the options follow the remote host name (as they do with
    rlogin).

    --aacccceessss
        Runs xhost locally to add the remote host to the host access list in
        the X server. This won't work unless xhost is given permission to
        modify the access list.

    --ddeebbuugg
        Normally, xon disconnects the remote process from stdin, stdout and
        stderr to eliminate the daemon processes which usually connect them
        across the network. Specifying the --ddeebbuugg option leaves them connected
        so that error messages from the remote execution are sent back to the
        originating host.
    --nnaammee window-name
        This specifies a different application name and window title for the
        default command (xterm).

    --nnoollss
        Normally xon passes the -ls option to the remote xterm; this option
        suspends that behaviour.
    --ssccrreeeenn screen-no
        This changes the screen number of the DISPLAY variable passed to the
        remote command.
    --uusseerr user-name
        By default, xon simply uses rsh/remsh/rcmd to connect to the remote
        machine using the same user name as on the local machine. This option
        cause xon to specify an alternative user name. This will not work
        unless you have authorization to access the remote account, by placing
        an appropriate entry in the remote users .rhosts file.

  BBUUGGSS

    Xon can get easily confused when the remote-host, user-name or various
    environment variable values contain white space.

    Xon has no way to send the appropriate X authorization information to the
    remote host.
