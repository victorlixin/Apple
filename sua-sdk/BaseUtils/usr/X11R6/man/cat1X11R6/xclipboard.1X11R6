    The xclipboard program is used to collect and display text selections that
    are sent to the CLIPBOARD by other clients. It is typically used to save
    CLIPBOARD selections for later use. It stores each CLIPBOARD selection as
    a separate string, each of which can be selected. Each time CLIPBOARD is
    asserted by another application, xclipboard transfers the contents of that
    selection to a new buffer and displays it in the text window. Buffers are
    never automatically deleted, so you'll want to use the delete button to
    get rid of useless items.

    Since xclipboard uses a Text Widget to display the contents of the
    clipboard, text sent to the CLIPBOARD may be re-selected for use in other
    applications. xclipboard also responds to requests for the CLIPBOARD
    selection from other clients by sending the entire contents of the
    currently displayed buffer.

    An xclipboard window has the following buttons across the top:

    quit
        When this button is pressed, xclipboard exits.

    delete
        When this button is pressed, the current buffer is deleted and the
        next one displayed.

    new
        Creates a new buffer with no contents. Useful in constructing a new
        CLIPBOARD selection by hand.

    save
        Displays a File Save dialog box. Pressing the Accept button saves the
        currently displayed buffer to the file specified in the text field.

    next
        Displays the next buffer in the list.

    previous
        Displays the previous buffer.

    The xclipboard program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
    options as well as the following:

    --ww
        This option indicates that lines of text that are too long to be
        displayed on one line in the clipboard should wrap around to the
        following lines.

    --nnww
        This option indicates that long lines of text should not wrap around.
        This is the default behavior.

    In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the
    widgets which compose xclipboard. In the notation below, indentation
    indicates hierarchical structure. The widget class name is given first,
    followed by the widget instance name.

    Text is copied to the clipboard whenever a client asserts ownership of the
    CCLLIIPPBBOOAARRDD selection. Text is copied from the clipboard whenever a client
    requests the contents of the CCLLIIPPBBOOAARRDD selection. Examples of event
    bindings that a user may wish to include in a resource configuration file
    to use the clipboard are:

    *VT100.Translations: #override \
         <Btn3Up>:                select-end(CLIPBOARD) \n\
         <Btn2Up>:                insert-selection(PRIMARY,CLIPBOARD) \n\
         <Btn2Down>:              ignore ()
