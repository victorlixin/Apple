  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    This program is used to set various user preference options of the
    display.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --ddiissppllaayy display
        This option specifies the server to use; see _X(5X11R5).

    bb
        The bb option controls bell volume, pitch and duration. This option
        accepts up to three numerical parameters, a preceding dash(-), or a
        'on/off' flag. If no parameters are given, or the 'on' flag is used,
        the system defaults will be used. If the dash or 'off' are given, the
        bell will be turned off. If only one numerical parameter is given, the
        bell volume will be set to that value, as a percentage of its maximum.
        Likewise, the second numerical parameter specifies the bell pitch, in
        hertz, and the third numerical parameter specifies the duration in
        milliseconds. Note that not all hardware can vary the bell
        characteristics. The X server will set the characteristics of the bell
        as closely as it can to the user's specifications.

    bbcc
        The bbcc option controls bug compatibility mode in the server, if
        possible; a preceding dash(-) disables the mode, otherwise the mode is
        enabled. Various pre-R4 clients pass illegal values in some protocol
        requests, and pre-R4 servers did not correctly generate errors in
        these cases. Such clients, when run against an R4 server, will
        terminate abnormally or otherwise fail to operate correctly. Bug
        compatibility mode explicitly reintroduces certain bugs into the X
        server, so that many such clients can still be run. This mode should
        be used with care; new application development should be done with
        this mode disabled. The server must support the MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD
        protocol extension in order for this option to work.

    cc
        The cc option controls key click. This option can take an optional
        value, a preceding dash(-), or an 'on/off' flag. If no parameter or
        the 'on' flag is given, the system defaults will be used. If the dash
        or 'off' flag is used, keyclick will be disabled. If a value from 0 to
        100 is given, it is used to indicate volume, as a percentage of the
        maximum. The X server will set the volume to the nearest value that
        the hardware can support.

    ffpp== path,...
        The ffpp== sets the font path to the entries given in the path argument.
        The entries are interpreted by the server, not by the client.
        Typically they are directory names or font server names, but the
        interpretation is server-dependent.

    ffpp ddeeffaauulltt
        The ddeeffaauulltt argument causes the font path to be reset to the server's
        default.

    ffpp rreehhaasshh
        The rreehhaasshh argument resets the font path to its current value, causing
        the server to reread the font databases in the current font path. This
        is generally only used when adding new fonts to a font directory
        (after running mkfontdir to recreate the font database).

    --ffpp or fp-
        The --ffpp and ffpp-- options remove elements from the current font path.
        They must be followed by a comma-separated list of entries.

    ++ffpp or fp+
        This ++ffpp and ffpp++ options prepend and append elements to the current
        font path, respectively. They must be followed by a comma-separated
        list of entries.

    lleedd
        The lleedd option controls the keyboard LEDs. This controls the turning
        on or off of one or all of the LEDs. It accepts an optional integer, a
        preceding dash(-) or an 'on/off' flag. If no parameter or the 'on'
        flag is given, all LEDs are turned on. If a preceding dash or the flag
        'off' is given, all LEDs are turned off. If a value between 1 and 32
        is given, that LED will be turned on or off depending on the existence
        of a preceding dash. A common LED which can be controlled is the "Caps
        Lock" LED. "xset led 3" would turn led #3 on. "xset -led 3" would turn
        it off. The particular LED values may refer to different LEDs on
        different hardware.

    mm
        The mm option controls the mouse parameters. The parameters for the
        mouse are `acceleration' and `threshold'. The acceleration can be
        specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction. The mouse, or
        whatever pointer the machine is connected to, will go `acceleration'
        times as fast when it travels more than `threshold' pixels in a short
        time. This way, the mouse can be used for precise alignment when it is
        moved slowly, yet it can be set to travel across the screen in a flick
        of the wrist when desired. One or both parameters for the mm option can
        be omitted, but if only one is given, it will be interpreted as the
        acceleration. If no parameters or the flag 'default' is used, the
        system defaults will be set.

    pp
        The pp option controls pixel color values. The parameters are the color
        map entry number in decimal, and a color specification. The root
        background colors may be changed on some servers by altering the
        entries for BlackPixel and WhitePixel. Although these are often 0 and
        1, they need not be. Also, a server may choose to allocate those
        colors privately, in which case an error will be generated. The map
        entry must not be a read-only color, or an error will result.

    rr
        The rr option controls the autorepeat. If a preceding dash or the 'off'
        flag is used, autorepeat will be disabled. If no parameters or the
        'on' flag is used, autorepeat will be enabled. If a specific keycode
        is specified as a parameter, autorepeat for that keycode is enabled or
        disabled.

    ss
        The ss option lets you set the screen saver parameters. This option
        accepts up to two numerical parameters, a 'blank/noblank' flag, an
        'expose/noexpose' flag, an 'on/off' flag, an 'activate/reset' flag, or
        the 'default' flag. If no parameters or the 'default' flag is used,
        the system will be set to its default screen saver characteristics.
        The 'on/off' flags simply turn the screen saver functions on or off.
        The 'activate' flag forces activation of screen saver even if the
        screen saver had been turned off. The 'reset' flag forces deactivation
        of screen saver if it is active. The 'blank' flag sets the preference
        to blank the video (if the hardware can do so) rather than display a
        background pattern, while 'noblank' sets the preference to display a
        pattern rather than blank the video. The 'expose' flag sets the
        preference to allow window exposures (the server can freely discard
        window contents), while 'noexpose' sets the preference to disable
        screen saver unless the server can regenerate the screens without
        causing exposure events. The length and period parameters for the
        screen saver function determines how long the server must be inactive
        for screen saving to activate, and the period to change the background
        pattern to avoid burn in. The arguments are specified in seconds. If
        only one numerical parameter is given, it will be used for the length.

    qq
        The qq option gives you information on the current settings.

    These settings will be reset to default values when you log out.

    Note that not all X implementations are guaranteed to honor all of these
    options.
