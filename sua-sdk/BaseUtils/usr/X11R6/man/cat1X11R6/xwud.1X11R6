    Xwud is an X Window System image undumping utility. Xwud allows X users to
    display in a window an image saved in a specially formatted dump file,
    such as produced by _xx_ww_dd(1X11R6).

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --bbgg color
        If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed, this
        option can be used to specify the color to display for the "0" bits in
        the image.

    --ddiissppllaayy display
        This option allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
        _X(5X11R5).

    --ffgg color
        If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed, this
        option can be used to specify the color to display for the "1" bits in
        the image.

    --ggeeoommeettrryy geom
        This option allows you to specify the size and position of the window.
        Typically you will only want to specify the position, and let the size
        default to the actual size of the image.

    --hheellpp
        Print out a short description of the allowable options.

    --iinn file
        This option allows the user to explicitly specify the input file on
        the command line. If no input file is given, the standard input is
        assumed.

    --nneeww
        This option forces creation of a new colormap for displaying the
        image. If the image characteristics happen to match those of the
        display, this can get the image on the screen faster, but at the cost
        of using a new colormap (which on most displays will cause other
        windows to go technicolor).

    --nnoocclliicckk
        Clicking any button in the window will terminate the application,
        unless this option is specified. Termination can always be achieved by
        typing 'q', 'Q', or ctrl-c.

    --ppllaannee number
        You can select a single bit plane of the image to display with this
        option. Planes are numbered with zero being the least significant bit.
        This option can be used to figure out which plane to pass to xpr for
        printing.

    --rraaww
        This option forces the image to be displayed with whatever color
        values happen to currently exist on the screen. This option is mostly
        useful when undumping an image back onto the same screen that the
        image originally came from, while the original windows are still on
        the screen, and results in getting the image on the screen faster.

    --rrvv
        If a bitmap image (or a single plane of an image) is displayed, this
        option forces the foreground and background colors to be swapped. This
        may be needed when displaying a bitmap image which has the color sense
        of pixel values "0" and "1" reversed from what they are on your
        display.

    --ssccaallee
        Allow the window to be resized, and scale the image to the size of the
        window.

    --ssttdd maptype
        This option causes the image to be displayed using the specified
        Standard Colormap. The property name is obtained by converting the
        type to upper case, prepending "RGB_", and appending "_MAP". Typical
        types are "best", "default", and "gray". See _xx_ss_tt_dd_cc_mm_aa_pp(1X11R6) for one
        way of creating Standard Colormaps.

    --vviiss vis-type-or-id
        This option allows you to specify a particular visual or visual class.
        The default is to pick the "best" one. A particular class can be
        specified: "StaticGray", "GrayScale", "StaticColor", "PseudoColor",
        "DirectColor", or "TrueColor". Or "Match" can be specified, meaning
        use the same class as the source image. Alternatively, an exact visual
        id (specific to the server) can be specified, either as a hexadecimal
        number (prefixed with "0x") or as a decimal number. Finally, "default"
        can be specified, meaning to use the same class as the colormap of the
        root window. Case is not significant in any of these strings.
