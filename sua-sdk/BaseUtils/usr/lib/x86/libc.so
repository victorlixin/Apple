/*
 * libc.so:  (first released - SFU 3.0 JPN)
 *
 *   This file uses ld(1)'s internal language to specify which 
 *   archives are to be used  for 'libc.so'.  
 *
 *   libcompat30.a contains special code for backward compatibility.
 *
 *   Old Interix 3.0 (and Interix 2.2?) object files 
 *   (built using the old non-i18n SDK support)
 *   may have a dependancy on code which this compat library provides.
 *   So this allows new dynamic binaries to be built while still allowing
 *   old archive/object files to be linked in.
 *   
 *   NOTE: This support may be deprecated in the next release.
 *   We recommend recompiling all old archives/object files
 *   before the next release of SFU
