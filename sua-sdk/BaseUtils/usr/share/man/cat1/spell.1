  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The ssppeellll(1) utility compares words from one or more files specified in
    file (or standard input if no files are named) with those in a spelling
    list. It writes to standard output all words that were not found on the
    list.

    The ssppeellll(1) utility takes the following options:

    --bb
        Check against a British dictionary. The default dictionary is American
        English. The British dictionary contains spellings such as colour,
        behaviour, and recognise.

    --vv
        Write all words not in the spelling list. This is the default
        behavior. Some implementations of ssppeellll(1) also check against possible
        permutations of the words in the spelling list; for those systems,
        this option turns off that behavior.

    ++local_dict
        Treat the words in the file local_dict as correctly spelled. They will
        not appear in the ssppeellll(1) output. These words are checked in addition
        to the usual dictionary file.

    The ssppeellll(1) command exits with a status of 0 on success, and >0 if an
    error occurred.

  FFIILLEESS

    The ssppeellll(1) command makes use of the following files:

    //uussrr//sshhaarree//ssppeellll//bbrriittiisshh..hhaasshh
        British English dictionary extensions.

        American english dictionary file (the default).

    The ssppeellll(1) command is a wrapper around the iissppeellll(1) command. For
    information on dictionary files, formats, and other options that might be
    supported, see the reference page for iissppeellll(1).
