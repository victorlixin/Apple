    The ccaall(1) utility displays a simple calendar. If arguments are not
    specified, the current month is displayed.

    --jj
        Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

    --yy
        Display a calendar for the current year.

    A single parameter specifies the year (1 - 9999) to be displayed; the year
    must be fully specified: ccaall 8899 will not display a calendar for 1989. Two
    parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year. If no parameters are
    specified, the calendar for the current month is displayed.

    A year starts on Jan 1.

    The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on September
    3. By this time, most countries/regions had recognized the reformation
    (although a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.) Ten days
    following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the calendar
    for that month is a bit unusual.
