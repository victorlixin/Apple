    The nnll(1) utility reads lines from standard input or from ffiillee and writes
    those lines to standard output, with configurable line numbers.

    The nnll utility treats the text in terms of logical pages.

    Line numbers restart at the beginning of each logical page. A logical page
    contains a header, a body, and a footer, any of which can be empty. Each
    section of a logical page can have its own numbering. For instance,
    headers can have no numbers; blank lines, however, are numbered in the
    body, but not in the footer. Different line numbering options are
    independently available for header, body and footer sections

    The sections of a logical page are indicated by the following delimiters,
    which occur alone on an input line:
    LLiinnee       SSttaarrtt ooff

    \\::\\::\\::     header

    \\::\\::       body

    \\::         footer
    By default, a file contains only one logical page body.

    The nnll(1) utility takes the following options:

    --bb type
        Specify the logical body lines to be numbered. Values for type are:

        aa
            All lines are numbered.

        nn
            No line numbering.

        ppregexp
            Number only the lines containing the basic regular expression
            regexp.

        tt
            Number only lines consisting entirely of text characters
            classified as ggrraapphh characters in the current locale.

    --dd delim
        Set the delimiter characters from \\:: to the one or two characters
        specified by delim. If only one character is specified, the second is
        a colon (::).

    --ff type
        Specify the logical footer to be numbered. The values of type are the
        same as for --bb.

    --hh type
        Specify numbering for the logical header section. The values of type
        are the same as for --bb.

    --ii incr
        Increment the numbers of the logical page lines by incr. The default
        is 1.

    --ll num
        Treat num blank lines as 1. The default is 1. A value of --ll 33 means
        that only the third adjacent blank line is numbered if the logical
        section has numbering turned on.

    --nn format
        Number the lines in the specified format. Values for format are:

        llnn
            Left justified with leading zeroes suppressed.

        rrnn
            Right justified with leading zeroes suppressed. This is the
            default.

        rrzz
            Right justified with leading zeroes retained.

    --pp
        Preserve numbering; do not restart it at logical page delimiters.

    --ss sep
        Separate the line number and the text characters by the characters in
        the string sep. The default value of sep is a tab character.

    --vv startnum
        Begin numbering logical page lines with the value startnum. The
        default is 1.

    --ww width
        Use width characters for the line number. The default is 6.
