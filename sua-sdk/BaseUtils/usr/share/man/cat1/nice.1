    The nniiccee(1) command runs the specified utility with one or more given
    argument using a different scheduling priority. The increment is used to
    specify the change in priority. It can only be run successfully by a user
    with the appropriate privileges.

    To give a command a higher priority use a negative increment.

    If you do not specify an increment, the command runs at a slightly reduced
    priority.

    To change the priority of a running process, use the rreenniiccee(1) command.

    The nniiccee(1) utility takes the following options:

    increment
    --nn increment
        Alter the utility's status by increment. A negative increment gives
        the command a higher priority, so it runs at the expense of other
        processes. A positive increment gives the command a lower priority, so
        other processes receive precedence of utility.

    If nniiccee(1) succeeds in running utility, it returns the exit status of
    utility. Otherwise, it returns one of the following values:

    1-125
        An error occurred in nniiccee(1) itself.

    126
        The utility could not be invoked.

    127
        The utility could not be found.
