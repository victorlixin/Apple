    The ccuutt(1) utility selects portions of each line (as specified by list)
    from each file and writes them to the standard output. If no file is
    specified, or if the file is specified as a hyphen (--), the standard input
    is used. The items specified by list can be indicated in terms of column
    position or fields delimited by a special character. Column numbering
    starts from 1.

    List is a comma-separated or white space-separated set of increasing
    numbers, number ranges, or both. Each number range consists of a number, a
    hyphen (--), and a second number. The number range selects a set of fields
    or columns ranging from the column or field specified by the first number
    to the column or field specified by the second number. Numbers or number
    ranges may be preceded by a hyphen (--), which selects all fields or
    columns from 1 to the first number. Numbers or number ranges may also be
    followed by a hyphen (--), which selects all fields or columns from the
    last number to the end of the line. Numbers and number ranges may repeat,
    overlap, and occur in any order. It is not an error to select fields or
    columns not present in the input line.

    --bb list, --bytes list
        Cut based on a list of bytes. Each selected byte will be output unless
        the --nn option is also specified. It is not an error to select bytes
        not present in the input line.
    --cc list, --characters list
        The list specifies character positions.

    --dd string, --delimiter string
        Use the first character of string as the field delimiter character
        instead of the tab character.

    --ff list, --fields list
        The list specifies fields, delimited in the input by a single tab
        character. Output fields are separated by a single tab character.

    --nn
        Do not split characters. When specified with the --bb option, each
        element in list of the form low-high (hyphen-separated numbers) will
        be modified as follows:
        If the byte selected by low is not the first byte of a character, low
        will be decremented to select the first byte of the character
        originally selected by low. If the byte selected by high is not the
        last byte of a character, high will be decremented to select the last
        byte of the character prior to the character originally selected by
        high, or zero if there is no prior character. If the resulting range
        element has high equal to zero or low greater than high, the list
        element will be dropped from list for that input line without causing
        an error.
        Each element in list of the form low- will be treated as above with
        high set to the number of bytes in the current line, not including the
        terminating newline character. Each element in list of the form -high
        will be treated as above with low set to 1. Each element in list of
        the form num (a single number) will be treated as above with low set
        to num and high set to num.

    --ss, --only-delimited
        Suppresses lines with no field delimiter characters. Unless specified,
        lines with no delimiters are passed through unmodified.

    If file is specified on the command line by --, standard input is used. If
    no file is specified, standard input is used.
