    This command is a built-in command in the C Shell and the Korn Shell.

  CC sshheellll

    The ttiimmee(1) command executes command (which must be a simple command, not
    an alias, a pipeline, a command list, or a parenthesized command list) and
    prints a time summary as described in _tt_cc_ss_hh(1) under the time variable. If
    necessary, an extra shell is created to print the time statistic when the
    command completes. Without command, prints a time summary for the current
    shell and its children.

  KKoorrnn sshheellll

    The shell executes the pipeline and writes to standard error the elapsed
    time, the user time, and the system time for the command.

    Redirections after pipeline affect the last command in the pipeline, not
    the ttiimmee(1) command.
