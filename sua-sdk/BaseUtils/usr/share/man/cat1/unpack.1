    The uunnppaacckk(1) utility uncompresses files compressed with ppaacckk(1). It
    replaces the compressed files with their unpacked form. The specified file
    might or might not have the ..zz extension.

    The file cannot be unpacked for one of the following reasons:
    *     It cannot be opened.
    *     It does not appear to have been compressed by ppaacckk(1).
    *     A file with the unpacked name already exists.
    *     The file name without the ..zz extension is more than {NAME_MAX} bytes
          long. This is possible if the packed file was brought from another
          system.
