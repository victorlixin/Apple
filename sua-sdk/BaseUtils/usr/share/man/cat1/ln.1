    The llnn(1) utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) that has the
    same modes as the original file. It is useful for maintaining multiple
    copies of a file in many places at once without using up storage for the
    "copies"; instead, a link "points" to the original copy. There are two
    types of links: hard links and symbolic links. How a link points to a file
    is one of the differences between a hard or symbolic link.

    The options are as follows:

    --ff
        Unlink any already existing file, permitting the link to occur.

    --hh
        If the target is a symlink to a directory, do not descend into it.

    --nn
        An alias for -h for compatibility with other operating systems.

    --ss
        Create a symbolic link.

    By default, the llnn(1) utility makes hard links. A hard link to a file is
    indistinguishable from the original directory entry; changes to a file
    take effect regardless of the name used to refer to the file. Hard links
    cannot normally refer to directories or span file systems.

    A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked. The
    referenced file is used when an _oo_pp_ee_nn(2) operation is performed on the
    link. A _ss_tt_aa_tt(2) on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file. To
    obtain information about the links, use _ll_ss_tt_aa_tt(2). Unlike hard links,
    symbolic links can refer to directories and span file systems.

    Given one or two arguments, llnn(1) creates a link to an existing file
    source_file. If target_file is given, the link has that name; target_file
    can also be a directory in which the link is placed; otherwise, it is
    placed in the current directory. If only the directory is specified, the
    link will be made to the last component of source_file.

    Given more than two arguments, llnn(1) makes links in target_dir to all the
    named source files. The links will have the same name as the files to
    which they are linking. One cannot hard link a directory.
