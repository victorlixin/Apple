    The mmaaiillxx(1) utility is an electronic mail processing utility that is
    similar to a line editor for mail, except that lines are replaced by
    messages. The mmaaiillxx(1) utility has two basic modes of operation: reading
    mail and sending mail. Each mode has its own commands and options. The
    first synopsis line above is for sending mail.

    To send mail, give the command mmaaiillxx(1) and one or more login names (for
    users on the same computer) or e-mail addresses. The mmaaiillxx(1) utility
    prompts for a message (unless one has been supplied with the --ss option),
    and then enters input mode. All text typed into mmaaiillxx(1) form part of the
    message until you enter the end-of-file character or the command ~~... See
    "Sending and replying to mail" for a longer discussion; see Tilde/Escapes
    for a list of the commands used in input mode.

    To read mail, give the command mmaaiillxx(1). The mmaaiillxx(1) utility displays a
    list of message headers, each representing a message in your system
    mailbox. In this mode, you can read, save, and delete mail messages. You
    can also reply or send mail (dropping into input mode to do so), and set
    options to control the behavior of mmaaiillxx(1).

    The mmaaiillxx(1) utility takes the following options:
    --bblist
        Send blind carbon copies to list. List should be a comma-separated
        list of names. Normally, all recipients can see who was sent a copy of
        the message. That information is suppressed in a blind carbon copy,
        however, so that only the sender and the blind carbon-copy recipient
        know about the copy.
    --cclist
        Send carbon copies to list of users.

    --ee
        Check for mail in the system mailbox and exit without printing a
        message. If there is mail in the system mailbox, mmaaiillxx(1) returns an
        exit status of 0; otherwise, it returns an exit status of 1. In a
        shell script or a startup file such as ..pprrooffiillee, this is useful for
        checking for the presence of mail.
    --ff[[mbox]]
        Read in the contents of your mmbbooxx (or the specified file) for
        processing; when you qquuiitt, mmaaiillxx(1) writes undeleted messages back to
        this file.

    --HH
        Write a header summary only; this is only the first set of 18
        messages, starting with the first unread message.

    --ii
        Ignore tty interrupt signals. This is particularly useful when using
        mmaaiillxx(1) on noisy phone lines. You can also set this behavior inside
        mmaaiillxx(1) with the ignore option.

    --II
        Run mmaaiillxx(1) in interactive mode even when input is not a terminal. In
        particular, the tilde (~~) special character, when sending mail, is
        only active in interactive mode.

    --nn
        Inhibits reading the system startup files //eettcc//mmaaiill..rrcc and //eettcc//
        mmaaiillxx..rrcc upon startup.

    --NN
        Inhibit the initial display of message headers when reading mail or
        editing a mail folder.
    --sssubject
        Specify subject on command line. (Only the first argument after the --
        ss flag is used as a subject; be sure to quote subjects containing
        spaces.)
    --uuuser
        Is equivalent to:
        mailx -f /var/mail/user
        You must have the appropriate permissions to read mail for user.

    --vv
        Verbose mode. The details of delivery are displayed on the user's
        terminal.

  SSeennddiinngg mmaaiill

    To send a message to one or more people, mmaaiillxx(1) can be invoked with
    arguments that are the names of people to whom the mail will be sent. You
    are then expected to type in your message, followed by a CTRL+D at the
    beginning of a line. The section "Replying to or originating mail"
    describes some features of mmaaiillxx(1) you can use to compose messages.

    An e-mail address can be either a local address or an Internet-style
    address. Internet-style addresses are of the form name@domain; all other
    addresses are taken as local addresses. (The mmaaiillxx(1) utility does not
    recognize UNIX-to-UNIX [UUCP]-style bang addresses or the %-hack.)

  RReeaaddiinngg mmaaiill

    To read mail, give mmaaiillxx(1) no arguments. It checks your mail out of the
    post office, then prints out a one-line header for each message found.
    Each message is numbered, and the message your commands affect is called
    the current message. When you start mmaaiillxx(1), the current message is the
    first message, message 1. You can display the message using the pprriinntt
    command (which can be abbreviated pp). To make a new message the current
    message, use the commands ++ and -- to move backwards and forwards in the
    list, or specify a message by number. There are other ways of specifying
    which messages your commands will act on; see "Specifying messages."

  DDiissppoossiinngg ooff mmaaiill

    After you examine a message, you can ddeelleettee (dd the message or rreeppllyy (rr) to
    it. Deletion causes the mmaaiillxx(1) program to forget about the message. This
    is not irreversible; the message can be uunnddeelleetteedd (uu) by giving its
    number; or the mmaaiillxx(1) session can be aborted by giving the eexxiitt (xx)
    command (rather than the usual qquuiitt command). Usually, deleted messages
    completely disappear.

  SSppeecciiffyyiinngg mmeessssaaggeess

    Commands such as pprriinntt and ddeelleettee can be given a list of message numbers
    as arguments to apply to a number of messages at once. Thus, ddeelleettee 11 22
    deletes messages 1 and 2; ddeelleettee 11--55 deletes messages 1 through 5. The
    special name ** addresses all messages, and $$ addresses the last message.
    The command ttoopp, which prints the first few lines of a message, could be
    used in ttoopp ** to print the first few lines of all messages.

    Following is a list of message specifications and their explanations:

    num
        Message number num
    n--m
        Messages number n through m

    **
        All messages

    ..
        The current message

    ++
        The following appropriate message

    --
        The previous appropriate message

    ^^
        The first appropriate message in the list

    $$
        The last message in the list

    address
        All messages from address (as shown in the header)
    //string
        All messages with string in the subject line (case is ignored)
    ::c
        All messages of type c, where c is one of the following:

        dd
            Deleted messages

        nn
            New messages

        oo
            Old messages (messages that are unread or new)

        rr
            Read messages

        uu
            Unread messages

    The word "appropriate" is needed because although most commands work only
    on undeleted commands, the uunnddeelleettee command only works on deleted
    commands. So pprriinntt ^^ prints the first undeleted message in the list;
    uunnddeelleettee ^^ undeletes the first deleted message in the list.

  SSeennddiinngg nneeww mmaaiill oorr rreeppllyyiinngg ttoo mmaaiill

    You can use the rreeppllyy command to set up a response to a message, sending
    it back to the person who sent it to you. The text you then type in, up to
    an end-of-file, defines the contents of the message. While you are
    composing a message, mmaaiillxx(1) treats lines beginning with the tilde
    character (~~) specially. For instance, typing ~~mm (alone on a line) will
    place a copy of the current message into the response, right shifting it
    by a tab stop (see indentprefix variable later in this topic). Other
    escapes will set up subject fields, add and delete recipients to the
    message, and allow you to escape to an editor to revise the message or to
    a shell to run some commands. (These options are given in the summary that
    follows.)

  EEnnddiinngg aa mmaaiill--pprroocceessssiinngg sseessssiioonn

    You can end a mmaaiillxx(1) session with the qquuiitt (qq) command. Messages that
    have been examined go to your mbox file unless they have been deleted, in
    which case they are discarded. Unexamined messages go back to the post
    office. (See the --ff option discussed previously in this topic.)

  PPeerrssoonnaall aanndd ssyysstteemm--wwiiddee ddiissttrriibbuuttiioonn lliissttss

    It is also possible to create a personal distribution lists so that, for
    instance, you can send mail to cohorts or a defined group of people. Such
    lists can be defined by placing a line such as the following:

    alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark kridle@ucbcory

    in the file ..mmaaiillrrcc in your home directory. The current list of such
    aliases can be displayed with the aalliiaass command in mmaaiillxx(1). In mail you
    send, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent to others so that
    they will be able to rreeppllyy to the recipients.

    The mmaaiillxx(1) utility includes a number of options that can be set in the
    ..mmaaiillrrcc file to alter its behavior; thus set askcc enables the askcc
    feature. (These options are summarized later in this topic.)

  CCOOMMMMAANNDD SSUUMMMMAARRYY

    Each command is typed on a line by itself, and take arguments following
    the command word. The general syntax is:

    command [[ msg-list ]] [[ arguments ]]

    The command need not be typed in its entirety; the first command that
    matches the typed prefix is used. For commands that take message lists as
    arguments, if no message list is given, mmaaiillxx(1) uses the next message
    forward that satisfies the command's requirements. If there are no
    messages forward of the current message, the search proceeds backwards. If
    there are no good messages at all, mmaaiillxx(1) types "No applicable messages"
    and aborts the command.

    --
        Print out the preceding message. If given a numeric argument n, goes
        to the occurrence of the previous message specified by n and prints
        it.

    ??
        Print a brief summary of commands.

    !!
        Execute the shell (see sshh(1) and ccsshh(1)) command that follows.

    PPrriinntt
        (PP) Like pprriinntt but also print out ignored header fields. (See also
        pprriinntt, iiggnnoorree and rreettaaiinn.)

    RReeppllyy
        (RR) Reply to sender. Does not reply to other recipients of the
        original message.

    TTyyppee
        (TT) Identical to the PPrriinntt command.

    aalliiaass
        (aa) With no arguments, print out all currently defined aliases. With
        one argument, print out that alias. With more than one argument,
        create a new alias or change an old one.

    aalltteerrnnaatteess
        (aalltt) The aalltteerrnnaatteess command is useful if you have accounts on several
        computers. It can be used to inform mmaaiillxx(1) that the listed addresses
        are really you. When you rreeppllyy to messages, mmaaiillxx(1) will not send a
        copy of the message to any of the addresses listed on the aalltteerrnnaatteess
        list. If the aalltteerrnnaatteess command is given with no argument, the current
        set of alternate names is displayed.

    cchhddiirr
        (cc) Changes the user's working directory to that specified, if given.
        If no directory is given, then changes to the directory specified in
        HOME.

    ccooppyy
        (ccoo) Like ssaavvee, the ccooppyy command saves a file except that it does not
        mark the saved messages for deletion when you quit.

    ddeelleettee
        (dd) Mark the messages in the list as deleted. Deleted messages will
        not be saved in mbox, nor will they be available for most other
        commands. They are not actually deleted until you qquuiitt mmaaiillxx(1). See
        uunnddeelleettee.

    ddpp
        (also ddtt) Delete the current message and print the next message. If
        there is no next message, mmaaiillxx(1) says at end-of-file (EOF).

    eeddiitt
        (ee) Edit each message in the supplied message list using the editor
        specified in the EDITOR environment variable. On return from the
        editor, the message is read back in.

    eexxiitt
        (eexx or xx) Effects an immediate return to the shell without modifying
        the user's system mailbox, mbox file, or edit file in --ff.

    ffiillee
        (ffii) The same as ffoollddeerr.

    ffoollddeerrss
        List the names of the folders in your folder directory.

    ffoollddeerr
        (ffoo) The ffoollddeerr command switches to a new mail file or folder. With no
        arguments, it tells you which file you are currently reading. If you
        give it an argument, it will write out changes (such as deletions) you
        have made in the current file and read in the new file. Some special
        conventions are recognized for the name.

        ##
            The previous file

        %%
            Your system mailbox
        %%user
            The user's system mailbox

        &&
            Your mbox file
        ++file
            The named file in your folder directory (see the folder option)

    ffrroomm
        (ff) Print the message headers of the messages in a list.

    hheeaaddeerrss
        (hh) List the current range of headers, which is an 18-message group.
        The argument ++ displays the next 18-message group, and the argument --
        displays the previous 18-message group.

    hheellpp
        A synonym for ??

    hhoolldd
        (bb and pprreesseerrvvee) Marks each message in a supplied list to be saved in
        your system mailbox instead of in mbox. Does not override the ddeelleettee
        command.

    iiggnnoorree
        Add the supplied list of header fields to the ignored list. Header
        fields in the ignore list are not printed on your terminal when you
        print a message. This command is very handy for suppression of certain
        machine-generated header fields. The commands TTyyppee and PPrriinntt display a
        message in its entirety, including ignored fields. If no arguments are
        given, iiggnnoorree lists the current set of ignored fields.

    mmaaiill
        (mm) Send mail to the names specified as arguments; the names can be
        login names or distribution group names.

    mmbbooxx
        Indicate that a list of messages be sent to mmbbooxx in your home
        directory when you quit. This is the default action for messages if
        you do not have the hhoolldd option set.

    nneexxtt
        (nn, like ++ or pressing ENTER). Goes to the next message in sequence
        and types it. With an argument list, types the next matching message.

    pprreesseerrvvee
        (pprree) A synonym for hhoolldd.

    pprriinntt
        (pp) Display on the user's terminal each message in the message list.

    qquuiitt
        (qq) Terminate the session, saving all undeleted, unsaved messages in
        the user's mbox file in his or her login directory, preserving all
        messages marked with hhoolldd or pprreesseerrvvee or never referenced in the
        user's system mailbox, and removing all other messages from the user's
        system mailbox. If new mail has arrived during the session, the
        message "You have new mail" is given. If you qquuiitt while editing a
        mailbox file with the --ff flag, mmaaiillxx(1) rewrites file you are editing,
        and returns you to the shell, unless the file rewrite fails. If it
        fails, you can escape mmaaiillxx(1) with the eexxiitt command.

    rreeppllyy
        (rr) Reply to a message (or message list); the reply is sent to the
        sender and all recipients of one or more specified messages. The
        default message must not be deleted.

    rreessppoonndd
        A synonym for rreeppllyy.

    rreettaaiinn
        Add the list of header fields named to the retained list. Only the
        header fields in the retain list are shown on your terminal when you
        print a message. All other header fields are suppressed. The TTyyppee and
        PPrriinntt commands can be used to print a message in its entirety. If
        rreettaaiinn is executed with no arguments, it lists the current set of
        retained fields.

    ssaavvee
        (ss) Append each message in a message list to the end of a specified
        file. The mmaaiillxx(1) utility echoes to the terminal the file name, the
        line count, and the character count.

    sseett
        (ssee) With no arguments, prints all variable values. Otherwise, sets
        option. Arguments are of the form option=value (no space before or
        after =) or option. Quotation marks can be placed around any part of
        the assignment statement to quote blanks or tabs; that is,
        set indentprefix=->

    ssaavveeiiggnnoorree
        The ssaavveeiiggnnoorree command is to ssaavvee as iiggnnoorree is to pprriinntt and ttyyppee.
        Header fields thus marked are filtered out when saving a message by
        ssaavvee or when automatically saving to mbox.

    ssaavveerreettaaiinn
        The ssaavveerreettaaiinn command is to ssaavvee as rreettaaiinn is to pprriinntt and ttyyppee.
        Header fields thus marked are the only ones saved with a message when
        saving by ssaavvee or when automatically saving to mbox. The ssaavveerreettaaiinn
        command overrides ssaavveeiiggnnoorree.

    sshheellll
        (sshh) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.

    ssiizzee
        Takes a message list and prints out the size in characters of each
        message.

    ssoouurrccee
        The ssoouurrccee command reads commands from a file.

    ttoopp
        Takes a message list and prints the top few lines of each. The number
        of lines printed is controlled by the variable ttoopplliinneess and defaults
        to five.

    ttyyppee
        (tt)A synonym for pprriinntt.

    uunnaalliiaass
        Takes a list of names defined by aalliiaass commands and discards the
        remembered groups of users. The group names no longer have any
        significance.

    uunnddeelleettee
        (uu) Takes a message list and marks each message as nnoott being deleted.

    uunnrreeaadd
        (UU) Takes a message list and marks each message as nnoott having been
        read.

    uunnsseett
        Takes a list of option names and discards their remembered values; the
        inverse of sseett.

    vviissuuaall
        (vv) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor on each
        message.

    wwrriittee
        (ww) Similar to ssaavvee, except that only the message body (without the
        header) is saved. Extremely useful for such tasks as sending and
        receiving source program text over the message system.

    xxiitt
        (xx) A synonym for eexxiitt.

    zz
        The mmaaiillxx(1) utility presents message headers in windowfuls as
        described under the hheeaaddeerrss command. You can move forward to the next
        window with the zz command. Also, you can move back to the previous
        window by using zz--.

  TTiillddee eessccaappeess

    Here is a summary of the tilde escapes, which are used when composing
    messages to perform special functions. Tilde escapes are only recognized
    at the beginning of lines. The name tilde escape is something of a
    misnomer because the actual escape character can be set by the option
    eessccaappee.
    ~~!! command
        Execute the indicated shell command, then return to the message.
    ~~bb name ...
        Add the given names to the list of carbon-copy recipients, but do not
        make the names visible in the Cc: line ("blind" carbon copy).
    ~~cc name ...
        Add the given names to the list of carbon-copy recipients.

    ~~dd
        Read the file ddeeaadd..lleetttteerr from your home directory into the message.

    ~~ee
        Invoke the text editor on the message collected so far. After the
        editing session is finished, you can continue appending text to the
        message.
    ~~ff messages
        Read the named messages into the message being sent. If no messages
        are specified, read in the current message. Message headers currently
        being ignored (by the iiggnnoorree or rreettaaiinn command) are not included.
    ~~FF messages
        Identical to ~~ff, except all message headers are included.

    ~~hh
        Edit the message header fields by typing each one in turn and allowing
        the user to append text to the end or modify the field by using the
        current terminal-erase and kill characters.
    ~~mm messages
        Read the named messages into the message being sent, indented by a tab
        or by the value of indentprefix. If no messages are specified, read
        the current message. Message headers currently being ignored (by the
        iiggnnoorree or rreettaaiinn commands) are not included.
    ~~MM messages
        Identical to ~~mm, except all message headers are included.

    ~~pp
        Print out the message collected so far, prefaced by the message header
        fields.

    ~~qq
        Abort the message being sent, copying the message to ddeeaadd..lleetttteerr in
        your home directory if ssaavvee is set.
    ~~rr filename
        Read the named file into the message.
    ~~ss string
        Cause the named string to become the current subject field.
    ~~tt name ...
        Add the given names to the direct recipient list.

    ~~vv
        Invoke an alternate editor (defined by the VISUAL option) on the
        message collected so far. Usually, the alternate editor will be a
        screen editor. After you quit the editor, you can resume appending
        text to the end of your message.
    ~~ww filename
        Write the message onto the named file.
    ~~|| command
        Pipe the message through the command as a filter. If the command gives
        no output or terminates abnormally, retain the original text of the
        message. The command ffmmtt(1) is often used as ccoommmmaanndd to rejustify the
        message.
    ~~:: mail-command
        Execute the given mail command. Not all commands, however, are
        allowed.
    ~~~~ string
        Insert the string of text in the message prefaced by a single ~~. If
        you have changed the escape character, you should double that
        character to send it.

  MMaaiill ooppttiioonnss

    Options are controlled with sseett and uunnsseett commands. Options can be either
    binary or string. If they are binary, it is only significant to determine
    whether they are set or not. If they are string, the actual value is of
    interest. The binary options include the following:

    aappppeenndd
        Causes messages saved in mbox to be appended to the end rather than
        prepended. This should always be set (perhaps in //eettcc//mmaaiill..rrcc or //eettcc//
        mmaaiillxx..rrcc).

    aasskk
        Causes mmaaiillxx(1) to prompt you for the subject of each message you send
        (unless a message has been specified with --ss). If you respond with
        simply a newline, no subject field will be sent. This is synonymous
        with aasskkssuubb.

    aasskkbbcccc
        Causes mmaaiillxx(1) to prompt you for the blind copy list.

    aasskkcccc
        Causes you to be prompted for additional carbon-copy recipients at the
        end of each message. Responding with a newline indicates your
        satisfaction with the current list.

    aasskkssuubb
        Causes mmaaiillxx(1) to prompt you for the subject of each message you send
        (unless a message has been specified with --ss). If you respond with
        simply a newline, no subject field will be sent. This is synonymous
        with aasskk.

    aauuttoopprriinntt
        Causes the ddeelleettee command to behave like ddpp; thus, after deleting a
        message, the next one will be typed automatically.

    bbaanngg
        Causes mmaaiillxx(1) to treat specially exclamation marks in escape command
        lines. (See the eessccaappee command.) The default is off.
    ccmmdd==command
        Sets a command as the default command invoked by the ppiippee command.

    ddeebbuugg
        Setting the binary option ddeebbuugg is the same as specifying --dd on the
        command line and causes mmaaiillxx(1) to output various information useful
        for debugging mmaaiillxx(1).

    ddoott
        The binary option ddoott causes mmaaiillxx(1) to interpret a period alone on a
        line as the terminator of a message you are sending.

    flipr
        Reverses the meaning of the RR and rr commands.

    header
        Causes mmaaiillxx(1) to display a header summary when entered in read mode.
        The default is hheeaaddeerr.

    hhoolldd
        This option is used to hold messages in the system mailbox by default.

    iiggnnoorree
        Causes interrupt signals from your terminal to be ignored and echoed
        as @@ characters.

    iiggnnoorreeeeooff
        An option related to ddoott is iiggnnoorreeeeooff that makes mmaaiillxx(1) refuse to
        accept a CONTROL+D as the end of a message. The iiggnnoorreeeeooff option also
        applies to mmaaiillxx(1) command mode.

    kkeeeepp
        Causes mmaaiillxx(1) to truncate an empty mailbox, system mailbox, or mmbbooxx
        to zero length instead of removing it.

    kkeeeeppssaavvee
        Keep messages in the system mailbox even if they have already been
        saved in other files. The default is nnookkeeeeppssaavvee.

    mmeettoooo
        Usually, when a group is expanded that contains the sender, the sender
        is removed from the expansion. Setting this option causes the sender
        to be included in the group.

    nnoohheeaaddeerr
        Setting the option nnoohheeaaddeerr is the same as giving the --NN flag on the
        command line.

    nnoossaavvee
        Usually, when you abort a message with two RUBOUT characters (erase or
        delete), mmaaiillxx(1) copies the partial letter to the file ddeeaadd..lleetttteerr in
        your home directory. Setting the binary option nnoossaavvee prevents this.

    oonneeiinnttrr
        Abort letter on one interrupt instead of two. See also the iiggnnoorree
        option and the --ii option.

    oouuttffoollddeerr
        Causes mmaaiillxx(1) to store the files of outgoing messages in the
        relative directory specified by the ffoollddeerr variable. This has no
        effect if the value of ffoollddeerr is an absolute path name.

    ppaaggee
        Inserts a form-feed after each message sent through the pipe created
        by the ppiippee command.
    pprroommpptt==string
        Sets the command-mode prompt to string. The default is "? ". If the
        string is null, or nnoopprroommpptt is set, mmaaiillxx(1) does not prompt.

    qquuiieett
        Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.
    rreeccoorrdd==file
        Records all outgoing mail in file; the default is nnoorreeccoorrdd. If
        oouuttffoollddeerr is set, file is treated as a directory that will contain
        files with outgoing mail.

    rreeppllaacceeddeeaaddlleetttteerr
        If set, the existing dead-letter file is replaced by the cancelled
        mail rather than appending the cancelled mail to the existing dead-
        letter file.

    RReeppllyyaallll
        Reverses the sense of rreeppllyy and RReeppllyy commands.

    ssaavvee
        Forces mmaaiillxx(1) to save messages in the dead-letter file (specified by
        DEAD) if they are interrupted or there are delivery errors.

    ssaavveellooccaall
        If set, mmaaiillxx(1) tries to save the dead-letter file in the current
        directory instead of in the home directory.
    ssccrreeeenn==number
        Sets the number of lines in a screen of headers. This value is used by
        the hheeaaddeerrss and zz commands in mail-reading mode. If not set, mmaaiillxx(1)
        determines the current window size.

    sseeaarrcchhhheeaaddeerrss
        If this option is set, a message-list specifier in the form "/x:y"
        will expand to all messages containing the substring "y" in the header
        field "x". The string search is case insensitive.
    sseennddmmaaiill==command
        Specifies that command be used as the command for delivering mail
        messages. For local delivery (useful for automatic mail generated by
        utilities such as aatt(1)), set this value to //bbiinn//ssssiimmddaa. (It is
        automatically prefixed with the value of SUA_ROOT.) For external
        delivery, a package including sseennddmmaaiill(1) will be available in the
        future.

    sshhooww--rrccpptt
        Specifies that the recipient, not the sender, is displayed in header
        summaries.

    sshhoowwttoo
        When displaying a header summary, displays the recipient instead of
        the sender for any messages that you sent.

    SSiiggnn
        Contains a string that is inserted into the message when you give the
        ~~AA command.

    ssiiggnn
        Contains a string that is inserted into the message when you give the
        ~~aa command.

    vveerrbboossee
        Setting the option vveerrbboossee is the same as using the --vv flag on the
        command line. When mail runs in verbose mode, the actual delivery of
        messages is displayed on the user's terminal.

  OOppttiioonn ssttrriinngg vvaalluueess

    EEDDIITTOORR
        Path name of the text editor to use in the eeddiitt command and ~~ee escape.
        If not defined, a default editor is used.

    LLIISSTTEERR
        Path name of the directory lister to use in the ffoollddeerrss command.
        Default is //bbiinn//llss.

    PPAAGGEERR
        Path name of the program to use in the mmoorree command or when the ccrrtt
        variable is set. If this option is not defined, mmoorree(1) is used.

    SSHHEELLLL
        Path name of the shell to use in the !! command and the ~~!! escape. A
        default shell is used if this option is not defined.

    VVIISSUUAALL
        Path name of the text editor to use in the vviissuuaall command and ~~vv
        escape.

    ccrrtt
        The valued option ccrrtt is used as a threshold to determine how long a
        message must be before ppaaggeerr is used to read it. If ccrrtt is set without
        a value, then the height of the terminal screen stored in the system
        is used to compute the threshold (see ssttttyy(1)).
    eessccaappee==c
        If defined, the character c is used in place of the tilde character
        (~~) to denote escapes.

    ffoollddeerr
        The name of the directory to use for storing folders of messages. If
        this name begins with a forward slash (//), mmaaiillxx(1) considers it to be
        an absolute path name; otherwise, the folder directory is found
        relative to your home directory.

    MMBBOOXX
        The name of the mbox file. It can be the name of a folder. The default
        is mmbbooxx in the user's home directory.

    rreeccoorrdd
        If defined, gives the path name of the file used to record all
        outgoing mail. If not defined, outgoing mail is not so saved.

    iinnddeennttpprreeffiixx
        String used by the ~~mm tilde escape in place of the default tab
        character (^^II) for indenting messages. Be sure to quote the value if
        it contains spaces or tabs.

    ttoopplliinneess
        The number of lines to be printed with the ttoopp command; usually, the
        first five lines are printed.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS

    The mmaaiillxx(1) utility uses the following environment variables:

    DEAD
        The name of the file in which to save interrupted or cancelled mail.
        The default is $$HHOOMMEE//ddeeaadd..lleetttteerr.

    EDITOR
        The editor to use when the eeddiitt or ~~ee commands are given.Default is
        vvii(1).

    HOME
        The user's home directory.

    LISTER
        The command used for listing the contents of the folder directory when
        the ffoollddeerrss command is given. Defaults to llss(1).

    MAILRC
        The personal startup file to use. Defaults to $$HHOOMMEE//..mmaaiillrrcc.

    MBOX
        The file used to save read messages. Defaults to $$HHOOMMEE//mmbbooxx.

    PAGER
        The command used to display a mail message if the number of lines in
        the message is greater than the value of the ccrrtt variable.

    SHELL
        The command interpreter to use for the !! command. Defaults to sshh(1).

    TERM
        The name of the terminal type. If the variable screen has not been
        set, mmaaiillxx(1) uses the description of the terminal to determine the
        number of lines on the screen.

    VISUAL
        The name of the editor to use when the vviissuuaall or ~~vv commands are
        given. Defaults to vvii(1).

    USER
