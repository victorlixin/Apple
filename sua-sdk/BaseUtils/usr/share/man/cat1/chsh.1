        Be verbose with information during the change.

    The cchhsshh(1) utility changes a user's default login shell. In the desktop
    SUA environment, this is not important: a user selects his or her
    shell using a desktop shortcut or a menu entry. However, this is important
    connecting remotely using a utility such as rrllooggiinn(1) or tteellnneett(1).

    The newshellpath is the path to the new shell (for example, /bin/tcsh or /
    bin/bash). The cchhsshh(1) utility first checks that the file named by
    newshellpath exists and that it is executable, and then checks to see if
    the file is in the list of approved shells (/etc/shells).

    After all of those conditions are satisfied, the utility changes the
    user's default shell.
