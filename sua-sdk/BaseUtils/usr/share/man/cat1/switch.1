    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    Each case label is successively matched, against the specified string that
    is first command and file-name expanded. The file metacharacters **, ??, and
    [......] can be used in the case labels, which are variable expanded. If none
    of the labels match before a 'default' label is found, the execution
    begins after the default label. Each case label and the default label must
    appear at the beginning of a line. The command bbrreeaakkssww causes execution to
    continue after the eennddssww. Otherwise, control can fall through case labels
    and default labels, as in C. If no label matches, and there is no default,
    execution continues after the eennddssww.
