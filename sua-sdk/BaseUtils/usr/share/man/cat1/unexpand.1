    The uunneexxppaanndd(1) utility converts spaces into tabs in the data from the
    standard input or the named files, and then writes the result on the
    standard output. Backspace characters are preserved into the output and
    decrement the column count for tab calculations. Without options,
    uunneexxppaanndd(1) only converts leading blank characters, those at the
    beginnings of lines.

    The uunneexxppaanndd(1) utility takes these options:

    --aa
        By default, only leading blanks and tabs are reconverted to maximal
        strings of tabs. If the --aa option is given, then tabs are inserted
        whenever they would compress the resultant file by replacing two or
        more characters.
    --tt tablist
        Specify tab stops according to tablist. The tablist is one or more
        positive decimal integers. If there is only one number, tabs are set
        tablist columns apart instead of 8 (the default).
        If more than one number is specified, they are taken as the positions
        of the tabstops. The numbers must be in ascending order.

    If --tt is specified, --aa is ignored.

    The uunneexxppaanndd(1) utility exits with status 0 on success and >0 if an error,
    such as a problem opening a file, occurred.
