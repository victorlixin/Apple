    A program to help generate bug reports about perl or the modules that come
    with it, and mail them.

    If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not part of
    the standard distribution), a binary distribution, or a non-standard
    module (such as Tk, and CGI), please see the documentation that came with
    that distribution to determine the correct place to report bugs.

    The ppeerrllbbuugg(1) utility is designed to be used interactively. Normally no
    arguments will be needed. Simply run it and follow the prompts.

    If you are unable to run ppeerrllbbuugg(1) (most likely because you do not have a
    working setup to send mail that ppeerrllbbuugg(1) recognizes), you might have to
    compose your own report, and email it to perlbug@perl.com. In such a case,
    you might find the --dd option useful to get summary information.

    Whenever reporting a bug, please include answers to the following
    questions:
    Can you use ppeerrllbbuugg(1) to submit the report?
        Among other things,
        ppeerrllbbuugg(1) will ensure your report includes crucial information about
        your version of perl. If ppeerrllbbuugg(1) is unable to mail your report
        after you have typed it in, you might have to compose the message
        yourself, add the output produced by ppeerrllbbuugg --dd and email it to
        perlbug@perl.com. If, for some reason, you cannot run perlbug at all
        on your system, be sure to include the entire output produced by
        running ppeerrll --VV (note the uppercase VV).
        Whether you use ppeerrllbbuugg(1) or send the email manually, please make
        your subject informative. Comments like "a bug" are not informative.
        Neither are "perl crashes" or "HELP!!!," these all are null
        information. A compact description of what is wrong is fine.

    Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the bug is in
    your code, or even to get no reply at all. The perl maintainers are busy
    folks, so if your problem is a small one or if it is difficult to
    understand or already known, they might not respond with a personal reply.
    If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, monitor the "Changes"
    file in any development releases that have occurred since the time you
    submitted the bug, and encourage the maintainers with kind words (but
    never any flames!). Feel free to resend your bug report if the next
    released version of perl comes out and your bug is still present.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --aa
        Address to send the report to. Defaults to perlbug@perl.com.

    --bb
        Body of the report. If not included on the command line or in a file
        with --ff, you will get a chance to edit the message.

    --CC
        Do not send copy to administrator.

    --cc
        Address to which copy of report should be sent. Defaults to the
        address of the local perl administrator (recorded when perl was
        built).

    --dd
        Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe output). This prints
        out your configuration data, without mailing anything. You can use
        this with --vv to get more complete data.

    --ee
        Editor to use.

    --ff
        File containing the body of the report. Use this to send a prepared
        message quickly.

    --FF
        File to output the results to instead of sending as an email. Useful
        when running ppeerrllbbuugg(1) on a computer with no direct Internet
        connection.

    --hh
        Prints a brief summary of the options.

    --ookk
        Report successful build on this system to perl porters. Forces --SS and
        --CC. Forces and supplies values for --ss and --bb. Only prompts for a
        return address if it cannot guess it (for use with _m_a_k_e(1)). Honors
        return address specified with --rr. You can use this with --vv to get more
        complete data. Only makes a report if this system is less than 60 days
        old.

    --ookkaayy
        As --ookk except it will report on older systems.

    --nnookk
        Report unsuccessful build on this system. Forces --CC. Forces and
        supplies a value for --ss, then requires you to edit the report and
        explain what went wrong. Alternatively, a prepared report might be
        supplied using --ff. Only prompts for a return address if it cannot
        guess it (for use with _m_a_k_e(1)). Honors return address specified with
        --rr. You can use this with --vv to get more complete data. Only makes a
        report if this system is less than 60 days old.

    --nnookkaayy
        As --nnookk except it will report on older systems.

    --rr
        Your return address. The program will ask you to confirm its default
        if you do not use this option.

    --SS
        Send without asking for confirmation.

    --ss
        Subject to include with the message. You will be prompted if you do
        not supply one on the command line.

    --tt
        Test mode. The target address defaults to perlbug-test@perl.com.

    --vv
        Include verbose configuration data in the report.
