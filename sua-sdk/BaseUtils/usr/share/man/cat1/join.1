    The jjooiinn(1) utility performs an "equality join" on the specified files and
    writes the result to the standard output. The "join field" is the field in
    each file by which the files are compared. The first field in each line is
    used by default. There is one line in the output for each pair of lines in
    file1 and file2 that have identical join fields. Each output line consists
    of the join field, the remaining fields from file1, and the remaining
    fields from file2.

    The default field separators are tab and space characters. In this case,
    multiple tabs and spaces count as a single field separator, and leading
    tabs and spaces are ignored. The default output field separator is a
    single space character.

    Many of the options use file and field numbers. Both file numbers and
    field numbers are 1-based; that is, the first file on the command line is
    file number 1 and the first field is field number 1.

    The following options are available:
    --aa file_number
        In addition to the default output, produce a line for each line in
        file file_number that cannot be paired.
    --ee string
        Replace empty output fields with string.
    --oo list
        The --oo option specifies the fields that will be output from each file
        for each line with matching join fields. Each element of list has the
        form file_number.field, where file_number is a file number and field
        is a field number. The elements of list must be either comma-separated
        or white-space separated. (The latter requires quoting to protect it
        from the shell, or, a simpler approach is to use multiple --oo options.)
    --tt char
        Use character char as a field delimiter for both input and output.
        Every occurrence of char in a line is significant.
    --vv file_number
        Do not display the default output, but display a line for each line in
        file file_number that cannot be paired. The options --vv1 and --vv2 can be
        specified at the same time.
    --11 field
        Join on the field specified by field of file 1.
    --22 field
        Join on the field specified by field of file 2.

    When the default field delimiter characters are used, the files to be
    joined should be ordered in the collating sequence of ssoorrtt(1), using the --
    bb option, on the fields on which they are to be joined. Otherwise, jjooiinn(1)
    might not report all field matches. When the field delimiter characters
    are specified by the --tt option, the collating sequence should be the same
    as ssoorrtt(1) without the --bb option.

    If one of the arguments file1 or file2 is "-", the standard input is used.

    For compatibility with historic versions of jjooiinn(1), the following options
    are available:

    --aa
        In addition to the default output, produce a line for each line in
        both file1 and file2 that cannot be paired.
    --jj11 field
        Join on the field of specified by field of file 1.
    --jj22 field
        Join on the field of specified by field of file 2.
    --jj field
        Join on the field of specified by field of both file 1 and file 2.
    --oo list ...
        Historical implementations of jjooiinn(1) permitted multiple arguments to
        the --oo option. These arguments were of the form
        "file_number.field_number" as described for the current --oo option.
        This has obvious difficulties in the presence of files named "1.2".

    These options are available only so historic shell scripts do not require
    modification and should not be used.
