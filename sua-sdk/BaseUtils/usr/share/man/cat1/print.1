    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    The pprriinntt command prints its arguments on the standard output, separated
    by spaces, and terminated with a newline. The --nn option suppresses the
    newline. By default, certain C escapes are translated. These include \\bb,
    \\ff, \\nn, \\rr, \\tt, \\vv, and \\00######. (Note that ## is an octal digit, of which
    there can be 0 to 3.) \\cc is equivalent to using the --nn option. \\ expansion
    can be inhibited with the --rr option. The --ss option prints to the history
    file instead of standard output, the --uu option prints to file descriptor n
    (n defaults to 1 if omitted), and the --pp option prints to the co-process
    (see the section on co-processes in _kk_ss_hh(1)).

    The --RR option is used to emulate, to some degree, the Berkeley Software
    Distribution (BSD) eecchhoo command, which does not process \\ sequences unless
    the --ee option is given. As above, the --nn option suppresses the trailing
    newline.
