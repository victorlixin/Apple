    The uunniiqq(1) utility reads the standard input comparing adjacent lines, and
    writes a copy of each unique input line to the standard output. The second
    and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not written.
    Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not adjacent,
    so it might be necessary to sort the files first.

    The following options are available:

    --cc
        Precede each output line with the count of the number of times the
        line occurred in the input, followed by a single space.

    --dd
        Do not output lines that are not repeated in the input.
    --ff fields
        Ignore the first fields in each input line when doing comparisons. A
        field is a string of non-blank characters separated from adjacent
        fields by blanks. Field numbers are one based; that is, the first
        field is field one.
    --ss chars
        Ignore the first chars characters in each input line when doing
        comparisons. If specified in conjunction with the --ff option, the first
        chars characters after the first fields fields will be ignored.
        Character numbers are one based; that is, the first character is
        character one.

    --uu
        Do not output lines that are repeated in the input.

    If additional arguments are specified on the command line, the first such
    argument is used as the name of an input file, and the second is used as
    the name of an output file.
