    The ffmmtt(1) utility is a simple text formatter that reads the concatenation
    of input files (or standard input if none are given) and produces on
    standard output a version of its input with lines as close to the goal
    length as possible without exceeding the maximum. The goal length defaults
    to 65 and the maximum to 75. The spacing at the beginning of the input
    lines is preserved in the output, as are blank lines and interword
    spacing.

    The ffmmtt(1) utility is meant to format mail messages prior to sending, but
    can also be useful for other simple tasks. For instance, within visual
    mode of the vvii(1) editor, you can reformat a paragraph and make the lines
    even by using the command:

    !}fmt
