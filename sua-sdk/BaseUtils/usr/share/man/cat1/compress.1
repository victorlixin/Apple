    The ccoommpprreessss(1) utility uses adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding to reduce the size
    of files. (The utilities ggzziipp(1), ppaacckk(1) and zziipp(1) also compress data,
    but they use different algorithms.) The ccoommpprreessss(1) utility reads data
    from the specified files or from standard input if no files are specified
    or if one of the files is --.. If ccoommpprreessss(1) reads standard input, it
    writes to standard output. If ccoommpprreessss(1) is not writing to standard
    output, it replaces the file with a new file whose name has the extension
    .Z appended. If adding .Z makes the name longer than {NAME_MAX} bytes
    long, the operation fails.

    If no files are specified, or the --cc option is given, the compressed data
    is written to standard output.

    If the invoking process has the appropriate privileges, ccoommpprreessss(1)
    preserves the ownership, modes, access time, and modification time of the
    original file.

    The ccoommpprreessss(1) utility exits with the following values:

    0
        Success.

    1
        An error occurred.

    2
        One or more of the files were not compressed because --ff was not
        specified and the files would have increased in size.

    >2
        An error occurred.

  NNOOTTEESS

    The XPG 4 specification recommends that, for portability reasons, bits not
    be set to a value larger than 14. Most implementations support values up
    to 16, but this is not guaranteed or required by any standards.
