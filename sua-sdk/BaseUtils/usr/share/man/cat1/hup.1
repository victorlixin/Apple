    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    With command, hhuupp(1) runs command so that it will exit on a hang-up signal
    and arranges for the shell to send it a hang-up signal when the shell
    exits. Note, however, that commands can set their own response to hangups,
    overriding hhuupp. Without an argument (allowed only in a shell script),
    hhuupp(1) causes the shell to exit on a hangup for the remainder of the
    script. (See also Signal Handling in _tt_cc_ss_hh(1) and the _nn_oo_hh_uu_pp(1) built-in
    command.)
