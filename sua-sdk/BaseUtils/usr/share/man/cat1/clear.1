    The cclleeaarr(1) utility clears the screen of your terminal. It leaves the
    cursor in the "home" position, at the top left corner of the screen.

    The cclleeaarr(1) command ignores any arguments.

    Only the visible contents of the terminal window are cleared. The screen
    buffer preceding the cleared area is preserved.

    The cclleeaarr(1) utility does not properly clear the terminal screen if you
    use any means other than ssttttyy(1) to resize an open terminal window.

    _POSIX_TERM
        When set to "on," this environment variable indicates that POSIX-style
        terminal semantics are on.

    TERM
        Specifies the type of terminal.

    TERMCAP
        Contains either the location of the termcap file, as an absolute path
        name (it must start with /), or a termcap terminal description entry,
        to be used instead of the termcap entry for the current terminal type.
        If it contains an entry, the entry has no newlines.

    TERMPATH
        A space- or colon-separated list of absolute file names. If TERMCAP is
        not set, cclleeaarr(1) searches for the appropriate terminal entry in these
        files.
