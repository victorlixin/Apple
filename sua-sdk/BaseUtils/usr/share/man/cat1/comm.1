    The ccoommmm(1) utility reads file1 and file2, which should be sorted
    lexically, and produces three text columns as output: lines only in file1;
    lines only in file2; and lines in both files.

    The file name indicated by a hyphen -- means the standard input.

    --11
        Suppress printing of column 1.

    --22
        Suppress printing of column 2.

    --33
        Suppress printing of column 3.

    --ff
        Fold case in line comparisons.

    Each column will have a number of tab characters prepended to it equal to
    the number of lower numbered columns that are being printed. For example,
    if column number two is being suppressed, lines printed in column number
    one will not have any tabs preceding them, and lines printed in column
    number three will have one.

    The ccoommmm(1) utility assumes that the files are lexically sorted; all
    characters participate in line comparisons.
