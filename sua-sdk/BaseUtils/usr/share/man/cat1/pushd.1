    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    Without arguments, the ppuusshhdd(1) command exchanges the top two elements of
    the directory stack. If pushdtohome is set, ppuusshhdd without arguments does
    'pushd ~', like _cc_dd(1) . With name, ppuusshhdd pushes the current working
    directory onto the directory stack and changes to name. If name is '-', it
    is interpreted as the previous working directory (see "File-name
    substitution" in _tt_cc_ss_hh(1) ). If dunique is set, ppuusshhdd removes any instances
    of name from the stack before pushing it onto the stack. With a number
    '+n', ppuusshhdd rotates the element of the directory stack identified by n
    around to be the top element and changes to it. If dextract is set,
    however, 'pushd +n' extracts the directory by n, pushes it onto the top of
    the stack and changes to it.

    All forms of ppuusshhdd print the final directory stack, just like _dd_ii_rr_ss(1). The
    pushdsilent shell variable can be set to prevent this, and the --pp flag can
    be given to override pushdsilent. The --ll, --nn and --vv flags have the same
    effect on ppuusshhdd as on _dd_ii_rr_ss(1).
