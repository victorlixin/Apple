    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The hhaasshhssttaatt(1) command prints a statistics line indicating how effective
    the internal hash table has been at locating commands (and avoiding calls
    to eexxeecc). An eexxeecc is attempted for each component of the path where the
    hash function indicates a possible match, and in each component that does
    not begin with a '//'.

    On computers without vfork, prints only the number and size of hash
    buckets.
