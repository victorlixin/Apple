    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The lliimmiitt(1) command restricts the consumption by the current process and
    each process it creates so that none of the processes can individually
    exceed maximum-use on the specified resource. If no maximum-use is given,
    the current limit is printed; if no resource is given, all limitations are
    given. If the --hh flag is given, the hard limits are used instead of the
    current limits. The hard limits impose a ceiling on the values of the
    current limits. Only a user with appropriate permissions can raise the
    hard limits, but any user can lower or raise the current limits within the
    established range.

    Controllable resources currently include:

    ccppuuttiimmee
        The maximum number of cpu-seconds to be used by each process.

    ffiilleessiizzee
        The largest single file that can be created.

    ddaattaassiizzee
        The maximum growth of the data+stack region through _ss_bb_rr_kk(3) beyond the
        end of the program text.

    ssttaacckkssiizzee
        The maximum size of the automatically extended stack region.

    ccoorreedduummppssiizzee
        The size of the largest core dump that will be created.

    mmeemmoorryyuussee
        The maximum amount of physical memory a process can have allocated to
        it at a given time.

    The maximum-use argument can be given as a (floating point or integer)
    number followed by a scale factor. For all limits other than ccppuuttiimmee, the
    default scale is 'k' or 'kilobytes' (1024 bytes); a scale factor of 'm' or
    'megabytes' can also be used. For ccppuuttiimmee, the default scaling is
    'seconds', while 'm' for minutes or 'h' for hours, or a time of the form
    'mm:ss' (giving minutes and seconds) can be used.

    For both resource names and scale factors, unambiguous prefixes of the
    names suffice.
