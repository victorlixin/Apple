    The ccooll(1) utility filters out reverse (and half reverse) line feeds so
    that the output is in the correct order with only forward and half forward
    line feeds. It replaces white-space characters with tabs where possible.
    This can be useful in processing the output of nnrrooffff(1) and ttbbll(1).

    The ccooll(1) utility reads from the standard input and writes to the
    standard output.

    --bb
        Do not output any backspaces; prints only the last character written
        to each column position.

    --ff
        Forward half line feeds are permitted ("fine" mode). Characters
        printed on a half line boundary are usually printed on the following
        line.

    --hh
        Compress spaces into tabs.  This is the default behavior.

    --pp
        Escape sequence will not be changed. By default ccooll will normally
        remove escape sequences not listed in the table below.

    --xx
        Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.

    --ll num
        Buffer at least num lines in memory. By default, 128 lines are
        buffered.

    The following tables lists the control sequences for carriage motion that
    ccooll(1) understands and their decimal values:

    ESC-7               reverse line feed (escape then 7)

    ESC-8               half reverse line feed (escape then 8)

    ESC-9               half forward line feed (escape then 9)

    backspace           moves back one column (8); ignored in the first
                        column

    carriage return     (13)

    newline             forward line feed (10); also does carriage return

    shift in            shift to normal character set (15)

    shift out           shift to alternate character set (14)

    space               moves forward one column (32)

    tab                 moves forward to next tab stop (9)

    vertical tab        reverse line feed (11)

    All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are discarded.

    The ccooll(1) utility keeps track of the character set as characters are read
    and ensures that the character set is correct when they are output.

    If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line, ccooll(1) will
    display a warning message.
