    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    When used alone, @@ prints the value of all shell variables.

    When used in the form @@name == expr, @@ sets the specified name to the value
    of expr. If expr contains <<, >>, && or '''', at least that part of expr must
    be placed within (()).

    When used in the form @@ name[index]== expr, @@ assigns the value of expr to
    the argument of name specified by index. Both name and the component
    specified by index must already exist. The expr argument can contain the
    operators **, ++, and so on, as in C. The space separating the name from the
    assignment operator is optional. Spaces are mandatory, however, in
    separating components of expr that would otherwise be single words.
    Special postfix ++++ and ---- operators increment and decrement name
    respectively, such as @@ ii++++.
