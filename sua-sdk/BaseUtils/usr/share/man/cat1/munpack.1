    The mmuunnppaacckk(1) program reads each RFC-822 message filename and writes all
    non-text Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) parts or split-
    uuencoded files as files. If no file-name argument is given, mmuunnppaacckk(1)
    reads from standard input.

    If the message suggests a file name to use for the imbedded part, that
    name is cleaned of potential problem characters and used for the output
    file. If the suggested file name includes subdirectories, they will be
    created as necessary. If the message does not suggest a file name, the
    names "part1", "part2", and so on, are used in sequence.

    If the imbedded part was preceded with textual information, that
    information is also written to a file. The file is named the same as the
    imbedded part, with any file-name extension replaced with ..ddeesscc.

    The mmuunnppaacckk(1) utility accepts the following options:
    --CC directory
        Change the current directory to directory before reading any files.
        This is useful when invoking mmuunnppaacckk(1) from a mail or news reader.

    --ff
        Force overwriting of existing files. If a message suggests a file name
        of an existing file, the file will be overwritten. Without this flag,
        mmuunnppaacckk(1) appends ".1", ".2", and so on, to find a nonexistent file.

    --qq
        Be quiet. Suppresses messages about saving partial messages and about
        messages with no interesting information.

    --tt
        Also write the text MIME parts of multipart messages as files. By
        default, text parts that do not have a file name parameter do not get
        unpacked. This option effectively disables the ..ddeesscc file feature for
        MIME messages.

    To decode a MIME message, first save it to a text file. If possible, save
    it with all headers included. The mmuunnppaacckk(1) utility can decode some MIME
    files when the headers are missing or incomplete, other files it cannot
    decode without having the information in the headers. In general, messages
    that include a statement at the beginning that they are in MIME format can
    be decoded without the headers. Messages that have been split into
    multiple parts generally require all headers in order to be reassembled
    and decoded.

    Some LAN-based mail systems and some mail providers place the mail headers
    at the bottom of the message instead of at the top. If you are having
    problems decoding a MIME message on such a system, convert the mail back
    into the standard format by removing the system's nonstandard headers and
    moving the standard Internet headers at the top of the message (separated
    from the message body with a blank line).

    There must be exactly one message per file. The mmuunnppaacckk(1) utility cannot
    deal with multiple messages in a single file; to decode things correctly,
    it must know when one message ends and the next one begins.

    To decode a message, run the command:

    munpack file

    where file is the name of the file containing the message. More than one
    file name can be specified; mmuunnppaacckk(1) will try to decode the message in
    each file. The options already provided include more information on ways
    you can run mmuunnppaacckk(1).

    The mmuunnppaacckk(1) utility makes use of the following environment variables,
    if set:

    TMPDIR
        Directory to store temporary files. Default is the value of
        getconf CS_TMPDIR
        which is normally //ttmmpp.
