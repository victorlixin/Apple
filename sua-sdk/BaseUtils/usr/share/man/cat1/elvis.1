    The eellvviiss(1) utility is a text editor which emulates vvii(1) and eexx(1).

    The eellvviiss(1) utility can be installed under the names eexx(1) and vvii(1)
    (replacing the nnvvii(1) versions of eexx(1) and vvii(1)). You may also install
    eellvviiss(1) under the names vviieeww(1) and iinnppuutt. If eellvviiss(1) is installed on an
    NTFS partition, these extra names can be links to eellvviiss(1); see the ln(1)
    shell command.

    When invoked as vvii(1), the program behaves exactly as though it was
    invoked as "elvis". However, if you invoke eellvviiss(1) as vviieeww(1), then the
    readonly option is set as though you had given it the --RR flag. If you
    invoke the program as eexx(1), then eellvviiss(1) will start up in the colon
    command mode instead of the visual command mode, as though you had given
    it the --ee flag. If you invoke eellvviiss(1) as eeddiitt(1), then eellvviiss(1) will
    start up in input mode, as though the --ii flag was given.

    The eellvviiss(1) utility takes the following options:
    ++cmd
        The eellvviiss(1) utility executes the command cmd after loading the first
        file. A typical example would be "elvis +237 foo", which would cause
        eellvviiss(1) to start editing foo and then move directly to line 237. Cmd
        must be a colon command.
    --cc cmd
        The System V version of the ++ option. eellvviiss(1) executes cmd after
        loading the first file. A typical example would be "elvis -c 237 foo",
        which would cause eellvviiss(1) to start editing foo and then move directly
        to line 237. Cmd must be a colon command.

    --ee
        The eellvviiss(1) utility will start up in colon command mode (_ee_xx(1) mode).

    --ii
        The eellvviiss(1) utility will start up in input mode.
    --mm [file]
        The eellvviiss(1) utility will search through file for something that looks
        like an error message from a compiler. It will then begin editing the
        source file that caused the error, with the cursor sitting on the line
        where the error was detected. If you don't explicitly name a file,
        then "errlist" is assumed.

    --rr
        To the real vvii(1), this flag means that a previous edit should be
        recovered. The eellvviiss(1) utility, though, has a separate program,
        called elvrec(1), for recovering files. When you invoke eellvviiss(1) with
        --rr, eellvviiss(1) will tell you to run elvrec(1).

    --RR
        This sets the "readonly" option, so you won't accidentally overwrite a
        file.

    --ss
        This set the "safer" option, which disables many potentially harmful
        commands. It has not been rigorously proven to be absolutely secure,
        however.
    --tt tag
        This causes eellvviiss(1) to start editing at the given tag

    --vv
        The eellvviiss(1) utility will start up in visual command mode.
    --ww winsize
        Sets the "window" option's value to winsize.

  FFIILLEESS

    The eellvviiss(1) utility makes use of the following files:

    //ttmmpp//eellvv**
        During editing, eellvviiss(1) stores text in a temporary file.

    ttaaggss
        This is the database used by the :tags command and the --tt option. It
        is usually created by the ctags(1) program.

    $$HHOOMMEE//..eexxrrcc
        A file called ..eexxrrcc in your home directory is executed as a series of
        eexx(1) commands. A file by the same name may be executed in the current
        directory, too.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    TERM
        This is the name of your terminal's entry in the termcap or terminfo
        database. The list of legal values varies from one system to another.

    TERMCAP
        Optional. If your system uses termcap, and the TERMCAP variable is
        unset, then eellvviiss(1) will read your terminal's definition from //uussrr//
        sshhaarree//tteerrmmccaapp. (The SUA_ROOT directory is the location where you
        installed the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications.) If TERMCAP is set to the full pathname
        of a file (starting with a '/') then eellvviiss(1) will look in the named
        file instead of //uussrr//sshhaarree//tteerrmmccaapp. If TERMCAP is set to a value which
        doesn't start with a '/', then its value is assumed to be the full
        termcap entry for your terminal.

    TERMINFO
        Optional. If your system uses terminfo, and the TERMINFO variable is
        unset, then eellvviiss(1) will read your terminal's definition from the
        database in the //uussrr//sshhaarree//tteerrmmiinnffoo database. If TERMINFO is set, then
        its value is used as the database name to use instead of //uussrr//sshhaarree//
        tteerrmmiinnffoo.
    LINES, COLUMNS
        Optional. These variables, if set, will override the screen size
        values given in the termcap/terminfo for your terminal. On windowing
        systems such as X, eellvviiss(1) has other ways of determining the screen
        size, so you should probably leave these variables unset.

    EXINIT
        Optional. This variable can hold EX commands which will be executed
        instead of the .exrc file in your home directory.

    SHELL
        Optional. The SHELL variable sets the default value for the "shell"
        option, which determines which shell program is used to perform
        wildcard expansion in file names, and also which is used to execute
        filters or external programs. The default value is "/bin/sh".

    HOME
        This variable should be set to the name of your home directory.
        eellvviiss(1) looks for its initialization file there; if HOME is unset
        then the initialization file will not be executed.

    TAGPATH
        Optional. This variable is used by the "ref" program, which is invoked
        by the shift-K, control-], and :tag commands. See "ref" for more
        information.

  BBUUGGSS

    There is no LISP support. Certain other features are missing, too.

    Auto-indent mode is not quite compatible with the real vvii(1). Among other
    things, 0^D and ^^D don't do what you might expect.

    Long lines are displayed differently. The real vvii(1) wraps long lines onto
    multiple rows of the screen, but eellvviiss(1) scrolls sideways.

    Many other people have worked to port eellvviiss(1) to various operating
    systems. To see who deserves credit, run the ::vveerrssiioonn command from within
    eellvviiss(1), or look in the system-specific section of the complete
    documentation.
