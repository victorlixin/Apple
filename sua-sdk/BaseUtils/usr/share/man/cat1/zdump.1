    The zzdduummpp(1) utility prints the current time in each zonename named on the
    command line.

    These options are available:
    --cc cutoffyear
        Cut off the verbose output near the start of the given year.

    --vv
        For each zonename on the command line, print the time at the lowest
        possible time value, the time one day after the lowest possible time
        value, the times both one second before and exactly at each detected
        time discontinuity, the time at one day less than the highest possible
        time value, and the time at the highest possible time value, Each line
        ends with iissddsstt==11 if the given time is Daylight Saving Time or
        iissddsstt==00, otherwise.
