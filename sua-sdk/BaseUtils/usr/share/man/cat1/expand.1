    The eexxppaanndd(1) utility processes the named files or the standard input,
    writing the standard output with tabs changed into blanks. Backspace
    characters are preserved into the output and decrement the column count
    for tab calculations. The eexxppaanndd(1) utility is useful for pre-processing
    character files (before sorting, looking at specific columns, and so on)
    that contain tabs.

    --tt tablist
        Specify tab stops according to tablist. The tablist is one or more
        positive decimal integers. If there is only one number, tabs are set
        tablist columns apart instead of eight (the default).
        If more than one number is specified, they are taken as the positions
        of the tabstops. The numbers must be in ascending order.
    --tabstop
        If a single tabstop argument is given, tabs are set tabstop spaces
        apart instead of the default eight. If multiple tabstops are given
        (separated by blank characters or commas), the tabs are set at those
        specific columns.

    Any tab characters beyond the last specified tab in a multiple tabstop
    list are replaced by a single space.

    The eexxppaanndd(1) utility exits with status 0 on success and >0 if an error
    occurred; if, for example, a problem arose while attempting to open a
    file.
