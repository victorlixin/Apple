    Filters perl pod documents, which have a .pod extension, to LaTeX
    documents, which have a .tex extension. For example, the command ppoodd22llaatteexx
    ppeerrll__ddoocc..ppoodd produces the document ppeerrll__ddoocc..tteexx.

    Below is a description of how ppoodd22llaatteexx(1) makes translations from pod to
    LaTeX.

    *     Indented paragraphs are translated into \begin{verbatim}
          ...\end{verbatim}.
    *     The command =head1 heading is translated into \section{heading}.
    *     The command =head2 heading is translated into \subsection*{heading}.
    *     The command =over N is dependent on the following =item. If the
          following =item starts with *, =over N is translated into
          \begin{itemize}. If the following =item starts with 1., =over N is
          translated into \begin{enumerate}. If there is anything else, =over
          N is translated into \begin{description}. Also, the indentation
          level N is ignored.
    *     The =item * heading command is translated into \item heading. The
          =item 1. heading command is translated into \item heading. The =item
          heading command is translated into \item[heading].
    *     If it starts with \begin{itemize}, the =back command is translated
          into \end{itemize}. If it starts with \begin{enumerate}, the =back
          command is translated into \end{enumerate}. If it starts with
          \begin{description}, the =back command is translated into
          \end{description}.
    *     In heading text, and other paragraphs, the following translation of
          pod quotes are done; then, TeX special characters are escaped:
          ppoodd                        TTrraannssllaattiioonn

          I<text>                    {\em text\/}

          BI<text>                   {\bf text}

          SI<text>                   text1
                                     (Where text1 is a string with blank
                                     characters replaced with ~. )

          CI<text>                   {\tt text2}
                                     (Where text2 is a string with TeX special
                                     characters escaped to obtain a literal
                                     printout.)

          EI<text> (HTML escape)     TeX escaped string.

          LI<text>                   Referencing string.
                                     (As done by ppoodd22mmaann.)

          F<file>                    {\em file\/}

          Z<>                        A null string.
    *     The following headings are indexed:
          ppoodd                TTrraannssllaattiioonn

          =head1 heading     \section{heading}\index{heading}

          =head2 heading     \subsection*{heading}\index{heading}
                             (Only when heading does not match frequent patterns
                             such as DESCRIPTION, DIAGNOSTICS,...)

          =item heading      \item{heading}\index{heading}

          =item heading      \item{heading}\index{heading}

  BBUUGGSS

    If HTML escapes E<text> other than E<amp>, E<lt>, E<gt>, E<quot> are used
    in C<>, translation will produce wrong character strings. Translation of
    HTML escapes of various European accents might be wrong.
