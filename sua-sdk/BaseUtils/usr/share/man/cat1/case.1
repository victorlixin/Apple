    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    The ccaassee statement attempts to match word against the specified patterns;
    the list associated with the first successfully matched pattern is
    executed. Patterns used in ccaassee statements are the same as those used for
    file-name patterns, except that the restrictions regarding .. and // are
    dropped. Note that any unquoted space before and after a pattern is
    stripped; any space with a pattern must be quoted. Both the word and the
    patterns are subject to parameter, command, and arithmetic substitution,
    as well as tilde substitution.

    For historical reasons, open and close braces ({{}}) can be used instead of
    iinn and eessaacc (for example, ccaassee $$ffoooo {{ **)) eecchhoo bbaarr;; }}). The exit status of
    a ccaassee statement is that of the executed list; if no list is executed, the
    exit status is zero.
