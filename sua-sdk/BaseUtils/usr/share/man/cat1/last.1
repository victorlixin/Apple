    The llaasstt(1) utility will either (1) list the sessions of specified users,
    ttys, and hosts, in reverse time order; or (2) list the users logged in at
    a specified snapshot date and time in reverse-time order. Each line of
    output contains the user name, the tty from which the session was
    conducted, any host name, the start and stop times for the session, and
    the duration of the session. If the session is still continuing or was cut
    short by a crash or shutdown, llaasstt(1) will so indicate.

    --dd date
        Specify the snapshot date and time. All users logged in at the
        snapshot date and time will be reported. This can be used with the --
        ff file option to derive the results from stored wtmpx files. When this
        argument is provided, all options except --ff file and --nn are ignored.
        The argument should be in the form
        [[[[CC]]YY]][[MMDD]]hhmm[[.SS]]
        where each pair of letters represents the following:

        CC
            The first two digits of the year (the century).

        YY
            The second two digits of the year. If YY is specified, but --CCCC is
            not, a value for YY between 69 and 99 results in a YY value of 19.
            Otherwise, a YY value of 20 is used.

        MM
            The month of the year, from 1 to 12.

        DD
            The day of the month, from 1 to 31.

        hh
            The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.

        mm
            The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.

        SS
            The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
        If the CC and YY letter pairs are not specified, the values default to
        the current year. If the SS letter pair is not specified, the value
        defaults to 0.
    --ff file
        The llaasstt(1) utility reads the file file instead of the default, //vvaarr//
        aaddmm//wwttmmppxx.
    --#
        Limits the report to # lines, where # is an integer.
    --tt tty
        Specifies the terminal. The tty names can be given fully or
        abbreviated; for example, llaasstt --tt 0033 is equivalent to llaasstt --tt ttttyy0033.
        Also, ccoo is equivalent to ccoonnssoollee, and if tty begins with //ddeevv//, the
        path is ignored, so that llaasstt --tt //ddeevv//ttttyynn0022 is equivalent to llaasstt --
        tt ttttyynn0022.
    --hh host
        The host names can be names or internet numbers.

    --TT
        Display better time information, including seconds.

    If multiple arguments are given, and a snapshot time is not specified, the
    information that applies to any of the arguments is printed. Thus, llaasstt --
    tt ccoonnssoollee rroooott would list all of root's sessions as well as all sessions
    on the console terminal. If no users, host names, or terminals are
    specified, llaasstt(1) prints a record of all logins and logouts.

    The pseudo user reboot logs in at reboots of the system. Thus, last reboot
    gives an indication of mean time between reboot.

    If llaasstt(1) is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
    progressed. If interrupted with a quit signal llaasstt(1) indicates how far
    the search has progressed and then continues.

  FFIILLEESS

    //vvaarr//aaddmm//wwttmmppxx
        The login data base.
