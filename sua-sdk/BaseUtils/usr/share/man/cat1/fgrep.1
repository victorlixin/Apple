    The ggrreepp(1) utilities search the given input files, selecting lines that
    match one or more patterns; the type of patterns is controlled by the
    options specified. It is not considered an error if file is a file of type
    directory and no warning will be printed. By default, a pattern matches an
    input line if any regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input
    line without its trailing newline. A null RE matches every line. Each
    input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written to the
    standard output.

    For simple patterns or eexx(1)- or eedd(1)-style regular expressions (basic
    regular expressions, described in the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications Help), use the
    ggrreepp(1) utility. To use extended regular expressions, use the --EE flag, or
    invoke the program as eeggrreepp(1). To search for a fixed string instead of a
    pattern, use the --FF flag, or invoke the command as ffggrreepp(1). A fixed
    string is a string of characters; each character is matched only by
    itself.

    --cc
        Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.

    --EE
        Use extended regular expressions. Cannot be used with--FF.
    --ee expression
        Specify a pattern used during the search of the input. Multiple --
        ee options can be used to specify multiple patterns; an input line is
        selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.

    --FF
        Search for a fixed string rather than a regular expression. Cannot be
        used with --EE.
    --ff pattern_file
        The pattern is read from the file named by the path name pattern_file.
        Trailing newlines in the pattern_file are ignored.

    --hh
        Suppress file names in output. Usually, if more than one file is
        searched, ggrreepp(1) prints the file name before printing the matched
        line. This option suppresses that behavior.

    --ii
        The case of letters is ignored in making comparisons; uppercase and
        lowercase letters are considered identical.

    --ll
        List only the names of the files containing lines that match. Path
        names are listed once per file searched. If the standard input is
        searched, the path name stdin is written. Useful for command lines
        such as the following:
        vi 'grep -l -e "[Ee]xactly" *.txt'

    --nn
        Write the line number before each line of output; the first line in
        each file is 1 even if multiple files are specified.

    --oo
        Force file names in output. Usually, if more than one file is
        searched, ggrreepp(1) prints the file name before printing the matched
        line. This option forces the file name to be printed even if only one
        file is searched. For standard input, ggrreepp(1) prints "(standardinput):
        ".

    --qq
        Quiet: write nothing to standard output and exit with 0 if a line is
        selected.

    --ss
        Silent mode. Suppress error messages ordinarily written for
        nonexistent or unreadable files. Other error messages are not
        suppressed.

    --vv
        Selected lines are those not matching the specified patterns.

    --xx
        "Exact" matching: the fixed string or the regular expression must
        match the entire line before it is considered a match. For example,
        the string "abc" matches a line that contains only "abc" but not a
        line that contains "abcd".

    If no file arguments are specified, the standard input is used.

    The following characters are interpreted by eeggrreepp(1):

    $$
        Align the match from the end of the line.

    ^^
        Align the match from the beginning of the line.

    ||
        Add another pattern (see example below).

    ??
        Match 1 or fewer sequential repetitions of the pattern.

    ++
        Match 1 or more sequential repetitions of the pattern.

    **
        Match 0 or more sequential repetitions of the pattern.

    []
        Match any single character or range of characters enclosed in the
        brackets.

    \\
        Escape special characters that have meaning for extended regular
        expressions, the set of {$,.,^,[,],|,?,+,*,(,)}.

    The ggrreepp(1) utility exits with one of the following values:

    0
        One or more lines were selected.

    1
        No lines were selected.

    >1
        An error occurred.

    If the utility is invoked as eeggrreepp(1), the --EE flag is assumed. If the
    utility is invoked as ffggrreepp(1), the --FF flag is assumed.
