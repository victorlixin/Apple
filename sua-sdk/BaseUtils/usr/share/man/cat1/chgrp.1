    The cchhggrrpp(1) utility sets the group identifier (ID) of the file named by
    each file operand to the group ID specified by the group operand. If file
    is a symbolic link, the group of the file referenced by the symbolic link
    is changed unless the --hh option is used.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --ff
        Suppress error messages on files where the group could not be
        successfully modified.

    --hh
        If file is a symbolic link, change the group of the symbolic link.

    --HH
        If the --RR option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
        are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
        are not followed.)
    --LL
        If the --RR option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

    --PP
        If the --RR option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.

    --RR
        Change the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted in the files
        instead of just the files themselves.

    The --HH, --LL, and --PP options are ignored unless the --RR option is specified.
    In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions
    are determined by the last one specified.

    The group operand can be either a group name from the group database, or a
    numeric group ID. If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand
    is used as a group name.

    The user invoking cchhggrrpp(1) must belong to the specified group and be the
    owner of the file, or have appropriate privileges.
