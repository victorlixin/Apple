    wait [[jobid]]

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    This is a shell built-in command.

    The wwaaiitt(1) command waits for the specified job(s) to finish. The jobid is
    specified either by the process identifier (ID) of the last process in the
    command pipeline, or by prefixing the job-number (revealed by the _jj_oo_bb_ss(1)
    command) with a percent sign (%%).

    Other special job IDs are:

    %%++
        The most recently stopped job, or, if there are no stopped jobs, the
        oldest running job.

    %%%%,, %%
        Same as %%++.

    %%--
        The job that would be the %%++ job, if the latter did not exist.
    %%n
        The job with job number n.
    %%??string
        The job containing the string string (an error occurs if multiple jobs
        are matched).
    %%string
        The job starting with string string (an error occurs if multiple jobs
        are matched).

    The wwaaiitt(1) command will return if a signal for which a trap has been set
    is received, or if a HUP, INT or QUIT signal is received.

    If no jobs are specified, wwaaiitt(1) waits for all currently running jobs (if
    any) to finish and exits with a zero status. If job monitoring is enabled,
    the completion status of jobs is printed (this is not the case when jobs
    are explicitly specified).

    The wwaaiitt(1) command exits with the status of the last specified job,
    unless:
    *     The last job is killed by a signal, the exit status is 128+ the
          number of the signal.
    *     The last job cannot be found (it got killed or it had already
          finished), the exit status is 127.
