    The rreenniiccee(1) command changes the priority of running processes; the
    processes can be specified by process identifier (ID), group ID, or user.
    The rreenniiccee(1) command can only be run by a user with the appropriate
    privileges.

    The first syntax given is the standard version; the other synopses reflect
    obsolescent versions. The change in priority is given by increment; if you
    do not give the --nn option, the priority is not changed.

    In the obsolescent versions, the priority of the processes is changed to
    nice_value, which is an absolute priority, not a change in priority.

    The rreenniiccee(1) utility takes the following options:

    --gg
        Treat all operands as process group IDs.
    --nn increment
        Adjust the scheduling priority of the command by increment, a decimal
        integer. A positive value for increment lowers the priority; a
        negative value increases the priority.

    --pp
        Treat all operands as process IDs. This is the default if no options
        are specified.

    --uu
        Treat all operands as users, either as a user name (if a user exists
        with that name) or as a user ID.

    On success, rreenniiccee(1) exits with status 0; if an error occurred, it exits
    with status >0.
