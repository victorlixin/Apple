    The ppccaatt(1) utility unpacks files that were compressed by ppaacckk(1), and
    then writes the result to standard output.

    Each file is expected to be a file compressed by ppaacckk(1); the file operand
    need not include the ..zz suffix.

    The ppccaatt(1) utility will not unpack a file if the file does not appear to
    have been packed by ppaacckk(1), or if the file cannot be opened.

    Use the --ff option to force decompression.
