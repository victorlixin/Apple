    The mmkkddiirr(1) utility creates the directories named as operands, in the
    order specified, using mode rrwwxxrrwwxxrrwwxx (0777) as modified by the current
    uummaasskk(1).

    The options are as follows:

    --mm
        Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to the
        specified mode. The mode argument can be in any of the formats
        specified to the cchhmmoodd(1) command. If a symbolic mode is specified,
        the plus-sign operation character (++) and the minus-sign operation
        character (--) are interpreted relative to an initial mode of aa==rrwwxx.

    --pp
        Create intermediate directories as required. If this option is not
        specified, the full path prefix of each operand must already exist.
        Intermediate directories are created with permission bits of rrwwxxrrwwxxrrwwxx
        (0777) as modified by the current umask, as well as write-and-search
        permission for the owner.

    The user must have write permission in the parent directory.
