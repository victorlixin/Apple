    The llooccaalleeddeeff(1) utility creates new locales for use 
    by the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA). 
    It reads the character map identified by charmap, locale source
    identified by sourcefile, and multibyte-to-Unicode mapping file identified
    by unicodemap and then compiles them into a form usable by the locale-
    related functions It places the six output files in the directory
    specified by the name argument. If name does not contain a slash (/
    ) character, the locale is created in the default location (/usr/share/
    locale). A user must have the appropriate file-access permission to create
    a locale in the default location.

    The llooccaalleeddeeff(1) utility supports the following options:

    --cc
        Creates permanent output despite warning messages.
    --ff charmap
        Specifies the path name of a file containing a mapping of character
        symbols and collating element symbols to actual character encoings. If
        the --ff option is not specified, default character mapping is used,
        which is the ASCII character map for SUA.
    --ii sourcefile
        Specifies the path name of a file containing the source definitions.
        If this option is not present, source definitions are read from
        standard input.
    --mm unicodemap
        Specifies the file (in source format) containing the multibyte-to-
        Unicode character mapping for the code set used by the locale. If this
        option is not specified, then llooccaalleeddeeff(1) uses the codeset name from
        the charmap file to determine the mapping tables required to create
        the locale. If llooccaalleeddeeff(1) cannot find suitable mapping tables, then
        it fails to create the locale.
        Each entry in the unicodemap file consists of the hexadecimal value of
        the multibyte character followed by the hexadecimal value of the
        corresponding Unicode character. Each line in unicodemap can contain
        only one entry. Optional comments can be preceded by a pound sign (#).
        For example
        0x20 0x0020 # sample entry
        When this option is used, llooccaalleeddeeff(1) creates two binary mapping
        tables named _codesetname and codesetname_. These tables are created
        in the parent directory of the path specified by name.

    Possible status values for the utility are:

    0
        Success and the locale was successfully created.

    1
        Warnings (such as problems parsing the command line) but the locale
        was successfully created.

    2
        Errors the specification exceeded implementation limits or the
        character set or sets used were not supported by the implementation,
        and no locale was created.

    3
        User-defined locales are not supported by this implementation.

    >3
        Error or warning and no locale was created.

    /usr/share/locale
        Public area of llooccaalleeddeeff(1). When the name argument does not contain a
        slash, newly created locale definitions are stored in a new
        subdirectory of this directory.
    name/LC_COLLATE.dat
        One of the output files. It describes the rules for comparing strings
        in the locale's alphabet.
    name/LC_CTYPE.dat
        One of the output files. It contains information about character
        cases, character classes and case conversions for the locale
    name/LC_MESSAGES.dat
        One of the output files. It contains information about the language
        that messages should be printed in and what an affirmative or negative
        answer looks like.

        One of the output files. It describes the way monetary values should
        be formatted in the locale.

        One of the output files. It describes the rules for formatting numbers
        in the locale.
