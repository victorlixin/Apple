    The mmaaiillqq(1) prints a summary of the mail messages queued for future
    delivery.

    The first line printed for each message shows the internal identifier used
    on this host for the message, the size of the message in bytes, the date
    and time the message was accepted into the queue, and the envelope sender
    of the message. The second line shows the error message that caused this
    message to be retained in the queue; it will not be present if the message
    is being processed for the first time. The status character is one of the
    following: ** to indicate the job is being processed; XX to indicate that
    the load is too high to process the job; or -- to indicate that the job is
    too young to process. The following lines show message recipients, one per
    line.

    The mmaaiillqq(1) utility is identical to sseennddmmaaiill --bbpp.

    The options are as follows:

    --vv
        Print verbose information. This adds the priority of the message and a
        single character indicator (++ or blank) indicating whether a warning
        message has been sent on the first line of the message. Additionally,
        extra lines can be intermixed with the recipients indicating the
        "controlling user" information. This shows who will own any programs
        that are executed on behalf of this message and the name of the alias
        this command expanded from, if any.
