    In its first form, the mmvv(1) utility renames the file named by the source
    operand to the destination path named by the target operand. This form is
    assumed when the last operand does not name an already existing directory.

    In its second form, mmvv(1) moves each file named by a source operand to a
    destination file in the existing directory named by the directory operand.
    The destination path for each operand is the path name produced by the
    concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final path name
    component of the named file.

    The following options are available:

    --bb
        Create a backup before moving the file. The backup copy will have
        the original filename with a suffix. The default suffix is "~",
        but this can be adjusted with --SS or by the environment variable
        MV_BACKUP_SUFFIX. This option current creates a backup of files,
        not directories.

    --ff
        Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination
        path. (Any previous occurences of the --ii option is ignored.)

    --hh
        Hide the backup file as a "dot file". This option implies --bb.

    --ii
        Causes mmvv(1) to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file
        that would overwrite an existing file. If the response from the
        standard input begins with the character "y", the move is attempted.
        (Any previous occurences of the --ff option is ignored.)

    --nn
        Do not move a file if the _t_a_r_g_e_t already exists. This option
        overrides an earlier --ff, --ii, and --uu.

    --SS _s_u_f_f_i_x
        Use the string _s_u_f_f_i_x when naming the backup file instead of the
        default suffix of "~".

    --uu
        Only perform the move if the _t_a_r_g_e_t is older than the _s_o_u_r_c_e
        file.  This option overrides an earlier --ff, --ii, and --nn.

    --vv
        Verbose mode. Print the _t_a_r_g_e_t name once the move has finished.

    The last of any --ff, --ii, --nn or --uu options is the one which affects mmvv's
    behavior.

    It is an error for either the _s_o_u_r_c_e operand or the destination path to
    specify a directory unless both do.

    If the destination path does not have a mode that permits writing, mmvv(1)
    prompts the user for confirmation as specified for the --ii option.

    As the _rr_ee_nn_aa_mm_ee(2) call does not work across file systems, mmvv(1) uses ccpp(1)
    and rrmm(1) to accomplish the move. The effect is equivalent to:

    rm -f destination_path && \
    cp -pr source_file destination && \
    rm -rf source_file

    Specifying more than one --ff or --ii options is not considered an error. The
    option which appears last on the command line is the one used.

    The mmvv(1) utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
