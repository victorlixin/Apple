    The lleesssseecchhoo(1) utility prints its arguments on the standard output,
    separated by spaces, expanding wildcard characters in file names to the
    actual file names if the files exist. If matching files do not exist, file
    is printed unchanged. If an argument expands to a file name containing one
    or more spaces, the file names containing the spaces are enclosed in
    quotation marks ("). Specifying the --aa option causes lleesssseecchhoo to enclose
    all resulting file names in quotation marks, even if the file name does
    not contain a space. The following options can be used to override the
    default quotation marks printed by lleesssseecchhoo.
    --oox1 --ccx2
        Specifies the characters x1 and x2 as the opening and closing
        quotation marks, respectively.
    --ppn1 --ddn2
        Specifies the characters identified by the numbers n1 and n2 as the
        opening and closing quotation marks, respectively.
