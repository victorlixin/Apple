    The ccaalleennddaarr(1) command checks the current directory for a
	file named ccaalleennddaarr and displays lines that begin with either
	today's date or tomorrow's. On Fridays, events on Friday through Monday are
	displayed.

    Lines should begin with a month and day. They may be entered in almost any
    format, either numeric or as character strings. A single asterisk (*)
    matches every month. A day without a month matches that day of every week.
    A month without a day matches the first of that month. Two numbers default
    to the month followed by the day. Lines with leading tabs default to the
    last entered date, allowing multiple line specifications for a single
    date. By convention, dates followed by an asterisk are not fixed; that is,
    they change from year to year.

    The "calendar" file is preprocessed by ccpppp(1), allowing the inclusion of
    shared files such as company holidays or meetings. If the shared file is
    not referenced by a full path name, ccpppp(1) searches in the current (or
    home) directory first, and then in the directory /usr/share/calendar.
    Empty lines and lines protected by the C commenting syntax (/* ... */) are
    ignored.

    The following are examples of possible calendar entries:

    #include     <calendar.usholiday>

    #include     <calendar.birthday>

    6/15         ... June 15 (if ambiguous, will default to month/day).

    Jun. 15      ... June 15.

    15 June      ... June 15.

    Thursday     ... Every Thursday.

    June         ... Every June 1st.

    15 *         ... 15th of every month.

  NNOOTTEESS

    Older versions of the ccaalleennddaarr(1) program selected lines which had the
    correct date anywhere in the line. In this version, however, the date is
    only recognized when it occurs first on the line.
