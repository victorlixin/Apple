    The ppssxxooffffsseett utility is used to distribute space between POSIX offset
    values or to ensure that POSIX offset values are the same in trusted
    domains. This is sometimes required in networks containing a very large
    number of domains that have a very large number of users and groups.

    The ppssxxooffffsseett utility supports the following options:

    --vv
        Prefaces the output with the name of the computer on which the utility
        was run.

    --lliisstt
        Lists the current POSIX offset values of domains trusted by the
        principal domain.
    --sseett DomainName psxOffset_in_hex
        Sets psxOffset_in_hex as the POSIX offset of the domain identified by
        DomainName. The psxOffset_in_hex argument must be an eight-digit
        hexadecimal value (for example, 0xe0000000). This option can only be
        used on a domain controller by a user logged on with the appropriate
        privileges. After this option is used, all computers running 
		Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA) in the domain must be 
		restarted to ensure that they are using the correct offset values.
    --uuiidd 64bit_uid_in_hex
        Displays the full name of the user or group identified by
        64bit_uid_in_hex, a 64-bit hexadecimal value. This value must identify
        domain user or group (rather than a built-in or local user or group),
        and is typically obtained from an Event Viewer log entry.
    --ssiidd sid
        Prints the full name of the user or group identified by the Windows
        security identifier (SID) specified by sid.
    --nnaammee username
        Prints the SID of the user or group identified by username, specified
        in the form [domain++]name. Specify the name of the domain if it is not
        the name of the principal domain.

    The ppssxxooffffsseett utility can return one of the following values:

    The ppssxxooffffsseett binary can be run on Windows-based computers without 
	SUA. To do so, create a copy of the ppssxxooffffsseett named
    PPssxxooffffsseett...eexxee on the computer you want to run it on.
