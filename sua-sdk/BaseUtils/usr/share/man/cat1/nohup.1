    The nnoohhuupp(1) utility invokes utility with its arguments, and at this time,
    sets the signal SIGHUP to be ignored. The signal SIGQUIT can also be set
    to be ignored. If the standard output is a terminal, the standard output
    is appended to the file nnoohhuupp..oouutt in the current directory. If standard
    error is a terminal, it is directed to the same place as the standard
    output.
