    This command is a built-in command in the C shell and the Korn shell.

    The wwhhiillee(1) command executes the commands between the wwhhiillee and the
    matching eenndd while expr (an expression, as described in the section on
    expressions) evaluates non-zero. The elements wwhhiillee and eenndd must appear
    alone on their input lines. The _b_r_e_a_k(1) and _c_o_n_t_i_n_u_e(1) commands can be
    used to terminate or continue the loop prematurely. If the input is a
    terminal, the user is prompted the first time through the loop (as with
    _f_o_r_e_a_c_h(1)).

    A wwhhiillee is a prechecked loop. Its body is executed as often as the exit
    status of the first list is zero. The exit status of a wwhhiillee statement is
    the last exit status of the list in the body of the loop. If the body is
    not executed, the exit status is zero.
