    The ttffttpp(1) utility is the user interface to the Internet Trivial File
    Transfer Protocol (TFTP), which allows users to transfer files to and from
    a remote computer. The remote host can be specified on the command line,
    in which case ttffttpp(1) uses host as the default host for future transfers
    (see the ccoonnnneecctt command later in this topic).

  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS

    When ttffttpp(1) starts running, it issues the prompt

    tftp>

    and recognizes the following commands:
    ?? command-name ...
        Print help information.

    aasscciiii
        Shorthand for mmooddee aasscciiii.

    bbiinnaarryy
        Shorthand for mmooddee bbiinnaarryy.
    ccoonnnneecctt host-name [port]
        Set the host (and optionally port) for transfers. Note that the TFTP
        protocol, unlike the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), does not maintain
        connections between transfers. Thus, the ccoonnnneecctt command does not
        actually create a connection, but merely remembers what host is to be
        used for transfers. You do not have to use the ccoonnnneecctt command; the
        remote host can be specified as part of the ggeett or ppuutt commands.
    ggeett filename
    ggeett remotename localname
    ggeett file1 file2 ... fileN
        Get a file or set of files from the specified sources. The source can
        be in one of two forms: a file name on the remote host, if the host
        has already been specified, or a string of the form hosts:filename to
        specify both a host and file name at the same time. If the latter form
        is used, the last host name specified becomes the default for future
        transfers.
    mmooddee transfer-mode
        Set the mode for transfers; transfer-mode can be either aasscciiii or
        bbiinnaarryy.. The default is aasscciiii.
    ppuutt file
    ppuutt localfile remotefile
    ppuutt file1 file2 ... fileN remote-directory
        Put a file or set of files to the specified remote file or directory.
        The destination can be in one of two forms: a file name on the remote
        host, if the host has already been specified, or a string of the form
        hosts:filename to specify both a host and file name at the same time.
        If the latter form is used, the host name specified becomes the
        default for future transfers. If the remote-directory form is used,
        the remote host is assumed to be a computer based on the open
        standards.

    qquuiitt
        Exit ttffttpp(1). An end of file also exits.

    rreexxmmtt
        retransmission-timeout Set the per-packet retransmission time-out, in
        seconds.

    ssttaattuuss
        Show current status.
    ttiimmeeoouutt total-transmission-timeout
        Set the total transmission time-out, in seconds.

    ttrraaccee
        Toggle packet tracing.

    vveerrbboossee
        Toggle verbose mode.

  NNOOTTEESS

    Because there is no user login or validation within the TFTP protocol, the
    remote site will probably have some sort of file-access restrictions in
    place. The exact methods are specific to each site and therefore difficult
    to document here.

    The commands ttrraaccee, vveerrbboossee, and ssttaattuuss are good aids for debugging
    connection problems
