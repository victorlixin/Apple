    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The gglloobb(1) command is like _ee_cc_hh_oo(1), but no '\\' escapes are recognized,
    and words are delimited by null characters in the output.It is useful for
    programs that use the shell to expand a list of words to matching file
    names (see “File-name substitution” in _tt_cc_ss_hh(1)).
