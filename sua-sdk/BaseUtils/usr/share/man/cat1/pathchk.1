    The ppaatthhcchhkk(1) utility checks the path names as specified by the pathname
    operand for portability problems. By default, ppaatthhcchhkk(1) checks each
    component of the path name, reporting diagnostic warnings when the path
    name:
    *     Is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes.
    *     Contains a component longer than {NAME_MAX} bytes.
    *     Contains a component in a directory that is not searchable.
    *     Contains a character in any component that is not valid.

    The options are as follows:

    --pp
        Instead of making the checks against the underlying NTFS file system,
        reports on the following portability related checks against the POSIX
        limits, when the path name:
        *     Is longer than {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} bytes.
        *     Contains a component longer than {_POSIX_NAME_MAX} bytes.
        *     Contains a character in any component that is not in the POSIX
              portable file-name character set.

    The ppaatthhcchhkk(1) utility tests whether a path name could be created. It does
    not require pathname to exist as a file.
