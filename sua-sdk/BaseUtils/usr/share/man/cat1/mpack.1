    The mmppaacckk(1) program encodes the named file in one or more Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) messages. The resulting messages are
    mailed to one or more recipients (specified by address), written to a
    named file or set of files, or posted to a set of newsgroups.

    The mmppaacckk(1) command takes the following options:
    --ss subject
        Set the SSuubbjjeecctt header field to Subject. By default, mmppaacckk(1) will
        prompt for the contents of the subject header.
    --dd descriptionfile
        Include the contents of the file descriptionfile in an introductory
        section at the beginning of the first generated message.
    --mm maxsize
        Split the message (if necessary) into partial messages, each not
        exceeding maxsize characters. The default limit is the value of the
        SPLITSIZE environment variable, or no limit if the environment
        variable does not exist. Specifying a maxsize of 0 means there is no
        limit to the size of the generated message.
    --cc content-type
        Label the included file as being of MIME type content-type, which must
        be a subtype of aapppplliiccaattiioonn, aauuddiioo, iimmaaggee, or vviiddeeoo. If this switch is
        not given, mmppaacckk(1) examines the file to determine its type.
    --oo outputfile
        Write the generated message to the file outputfile. If the message has
        to be split, the partial messages will instead be written to the files
        outputfile.01, outputfile.02, and so on.
    --nn newsgroups
        Post the one or more generated messages to the comma-separated netnews
        newsgroups.

        getconf CS_TMPDIR
        which is normally //ttmmpp.

    SPLITSIZE
        Default value of the --mm switch.
