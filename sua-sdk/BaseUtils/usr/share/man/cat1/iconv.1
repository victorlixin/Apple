    The iiccoonnvv utility converts the encoding of characters in a file from one
    coded character set to another, and writes the results to standard output.

    The input and output coded character sets are identified by fromCode and
    toCode. If the file argument is not specified on the command line, the
    iiccoonnvv command reads the standard input. If an invalid character is
    encountered in the input stream, the conversion operation is halted and an
    "Illegal byte sequence" error status is returned. If no conversion exists
    for a particular character, the input value is translated to the default
    substitute character.

    Specifying both the fromCode and toCode as Unicode is not permitted.

    The iiccoonnvv utility accepts the following options and arguments:

    --ff fromCode
        Specifies the input code set. This is optional and if not specified
        defaults to the code set for the current locale.
    --tt toCode
        Specifies the output code set. This is required and if not specified
        the usage message is displayed.

    file...
        One or more files that contain the data to be converted.

    --ll
        Displays a list of supported code sets.
