    The ppeerrllddoocc(1) utility looks up a piece of documentation in .pod format
    that is embedded in the perl installation tree or in a perl script, and
    then displays it using ppoodd22mmaann || nnrrooffff --mmaann || $$PPAAGGEERR. (In addition, if
    running under HP-UX, ccooll --xx will be used.) This is primarily used for the
    documentation for the perl library modules.

    Your system might also have manual pages installed for those modules, in
    which case you can probably just use the _m_a_n(1) command.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --hh
        Help. Prints out a brief help message.

    --vv
        Verbose. Describes search for the item in detail.

    --tt
        Text output. Display documents using plain-text converter instead of
        nroff. This might be faster, but it will not look as nice.

    --uu
        Unformatted. Find documents only; skip reformatting by pod2*.

    --mm
        Module. Display the entire module: both code and unformatted pod
        documentation. This can be useful if the documents do not explain a
        function in the detail you need and you want to inspect the code
        directly; ppeerrllddoocc(1) will find the file for you and simply hand it off
        for display.

    --ll
        File name only. Display the file name of the module found.

    --FF
        File names. Consider arguments as file names; no search in directories
        will be performed.
    --ff BuiltinFunction
        ppeerrllffuunncc. The --ff option followed by the name of a perl built-in
        function will extract the documentation of this function from
        ppeerrllffuunncc.
    --qq FAQKeyword
        ppeerrllffaaqq. The --qq option takes a regular expression as an argument. It
        will search the question headings in ppeerrllffaaqq[[11--99]] and print the
        entries matching the regular expression.

    --XX
        Use an index if present. The --XX option looks for a entry whose base
        name matches the name given on the command line in the file
        $$CCoonnffiigg{{aarrcchhlliibb}}//ppoodd..iiddxx. The ppoodd..iiddxx file should contain fully
        qualified file names, one per line.
    PageName|ModuleName|ProgramName
        The item you want to look up. Nested modules (such as File::Basename)
        are specified either as File::Basename or File/Basename. You can also
        give a descriptive name of a page, such as perlfunc. You can also give
        a partial or wrong case name, such as "basename" for "File::Basename",
        but this will be slower; if there is more then one page with the same
        partial name, you will only get the first one.

    Any switches in the PERLDOC environment variable will be used before the
    command-line arguments. The ppeerrllddoocc(1) utility also searches directories
    specified by the PERL5LIB (or PERLLIB if PERL5LIB is not defined) and PATH
    environment variables. (The latter is so that embedded pods for
    executables, such as ppeerrllddoocc(1) itself, are available.)The ppeerrllddoocc(1)
    utility will use, in order of preference, the pager defined in
    PERLDOC_PAGER, MANPAGER, or PAGER before trying to find a pager on its
    own. (MANPAGER is not used if ppeerrllddoocc(1) was told to display plain text or
    unformatted pod.)
