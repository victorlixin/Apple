    The ccsspplliitt(1) utility breaks the specified file into smaller files, as
    directed by the argn arguments. The argn arguments specify a context for
    where the file is to be split. If file is -, ccsspplliitt(1) reads standard
    input.

    --ff prefix
        Name the created files prefix0000, prefix0011, and so on to prefixnn. The
        default prefix is xxxx. If the prefix would make the resulting file name
        longer than {NAME_MAX}, ccsspplliitt(1) exits with a diagnostic message and
        no files are created.
    --kk arg
        Leave any previously created files intact if an error occurs.
        Otherwise, ccsspplliitt(1) removes them.
    --nn number
        Use number decimal digits to form file names for the file pieces. The
        default is 2. If the number of digits, combined with the prefix, would
        make the resulting file name longer than {NAME_MAX}, ccsspplliitt(1) exits
        with a diagnostic message and no files are created.

    --qq
        Suppress the writing of file size messages to standard output. A
        synonym for --ss.

    --ss
        Suppress the writing of file size messages to standard output.

    The arguments arg1 through argn specify where to split the file. They can
    be a combination of the following:
    //rexp//[++|--offset]
        Create a file using the current line up to but not including the first
        line that matches the basic regular expression rexp plus an optional
        offset. The offset is a positive integer preceded by ++ (for a number
        of lines after the regular expression match) or -- (for a number of
        lines before the regular expression match). That boundary, the regular
        expression match plus the offset (if any), becomes the new current
        line.
    %%rexp%%[++|--offset]
        Skip from the current line up to but not including the first line that
        matches the basic regular expression rexp plus an optional offset.
        This behaves in the same way as //rexp//, except that it doesn't create
        a file.

    line_num
        Create a file from the current line, up to but not including line
        number line_num. The first line is numbered 1, and the line line_num
        becomes the new current line.
    {{num}}
        Repeat previous operand num times.

    It is always an error if the argument does not match; ccsspplliitt(1) fails.

    If the file is split successfully, ccsspplliitt(1) exits with status 0.
    Otherwise, it exits with a status of >0.
