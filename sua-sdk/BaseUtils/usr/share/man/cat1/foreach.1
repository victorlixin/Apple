    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The ffoorreeaacchh(1) command successively sets the variable name to each member
    of wordlist and executes the sequence of commands between this command and
    the matching eenndd. (Both ffoorreeaacchh and eenndd must appear alone on separate
    lines.) Use the built-in command ccoonnttiinnuuee to continue the loop
    prematurely; use the built-in command bbrreeaakk to terminate it prematurely.
    When this command is read from the terminal, the loop is read once,
    prompting with 'foreach? ' (or prompt2) before any statements in the loop
    are executed. You can rub out any mistake you make typing in a loop at the
    terminal.
