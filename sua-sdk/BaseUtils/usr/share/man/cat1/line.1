    The lliinnee(1) utility reads one line of text from standard input and writes
    it to standard output. It reads up to and including a newline; and always
    writes at least a newline.

    Historically, lliinnee(1) is used in shell scripts to read from the user's
    terminal; the rreeaadd(1) command is preferred.

    The lliinnee(1) command exits with status 0 on success and >0 if end-of-file
    is found.
