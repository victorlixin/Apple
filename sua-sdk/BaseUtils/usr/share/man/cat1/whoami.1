    The wwhhooaammii(1) utility displays your effective user identifier (UID). If
    your effective UID belongs to the system's principal domain, it will be
    displayed alone. For example:

    $ whoami
    jcat

    where jcat is the login name.

    If your effective UID does not belong to the system's principal domain, it
    will be displayed as a Windows domain name and a login name, separated by
    a + sign. For example:

    $ whoami
    dev+jcat

    where dev is the domain and jcat is the login name.

    The output of the wwhhooaammii command is equivalent to the value of the shell
    variable LOGNAME.

    The option available for wwhhooaammii(1) is:

    --ss
        Strip domain name from output. This is equivalent to the value of the
        shell variable USERNAME.

    The wwhhooaammii(1) utility has been made obsolete by the iidd(1) utility. It is
    provided here as a shell script, equivalent to:

    id -un
