    The oodd(1) utility is mapped to the hheexxdduummpp(1) utility. As well as
    supporting the new POSIX.2 standard options, oodd(1) also supports most of
    the older Berkeley options (the second synopsis line). In the older
    syntax, you can supply an offset from the beginning of the file. If no
    file name is specified, you must place a ++ before the offset. The offset
    is assumed to be an octal value, unless it is followed by a decimal point,
    in which case it is assumed to be decimal. If the offset is followed by a
    bb, it is treated as a number of 512-byte blocks; for example, 10.b
    represents an offset of 5120 bytes.

    --AA addr-base
        Specify the base in which the address is presented for input; addr-
        base must be one of the following:

        dd
            decimal

        oo
            octal

        xx
            hexadecimal

        nn
            none (offset is not written)

    --aa
        Display bytes in ASCII control characters are translated to a three-
        letter abbreviation (such as soh, etx and so on).

    --BB
        Display in unsigned octal words of two bytes.

    --bb
        Display unsigned bytes in octal.

    --cc
        Display bytes in ASCII control characters are translated to backslash-
        escape sequences or to a raw octal number.

    --DD
        Display unsigned decimal long words of four bytes.

    --dd
        Display unsigned decimal words of two bytes.

    --ee
        Display floating point words of eight bytes. In _pp_rr_ii_nn_tt_ff(3) notation,
        they are displayed as %21.14e.

    --FF
        Display floating point words of eight bytes. In _pp_rr_ii_nn_tt_ff(3) notation,
        they are displayed as %21.14e.

    --ff
        Display floating point words of four bytes. In _pp_rr_ii_nn_tt_ff(3) notation,
        they are displayed as %14.7e.

    --HH
        Display in unsigned hexadecimal long words of four bytes.

    --hh
        Display in unsigned hexadecimal words of two bytes.

    --II
        Display in decimal long words of four bytes.
    --jj skip
        Jump over skip bytes from the beginning of the input.

    --LL
        Display in decimal long words of four bytes. (Same as --II).

    --ll
        Display in decimal long words of four bytes. (Same as --II).
    --NN count
        Format no more than count bytes of data.

    --OO
        Display in unsigned octal long words of four bytes.

    --oo
        Display in unsigned octal words of two bytes.

    --ss
        Display in signed decimal words of two bytes.

    --SS
        Display in signed decimal long words of four bytes.
    --tt typestring
        Specify one or more output types. Values for typestring can be:

        aa
            ASCII characters from the ISO 646 character set.

        cc
            Characters; non-printable characters are displayed as backslash
            sequences.
        dd[n]
            Signed decimal; the single digit n is optional and specifies how
            many bytes to use. The size of n must be the size of a cchhaarr,
            sshhoorrtt, iinntt, or lloonngg. The default is the size of an iinntt.
        ff[n]
            Floating point; the single digit n is optional and specifies how
            many bytes to use. The size of n must be the size of a ffllooaatt,
            ddoouubbllee, or a lloonngg ddoouubbllee. The default is the size of a ddoouubbllee.
        oo[n]
            Octal; the single digit n is optional and specifies how many bytes
            to use. The size of n must be the size of a cchhaarr, sshhoorrtt, iinntt, or
            lloonngg. The default is the size of an iinntt.
        uu[n]
            Unsigned decimal; the single digit n is optional and specifies how
            many bytes to use. The size of n must be the size of a cchhaarr,
            sshhoorrtt, iinntt, or lloonngg. The default is the size of an iinntt.
        xx[n]
            Hexadecimal; the single digit n is optional and specifies how many
            bytes to use. The size of n must be the size of a cchhaarr, sshhoorrtt,
            iinntt, or lloonngg. The default is the size of an iinntt.
        The default value is --tt oo22

    --vv
        Write all input data. Without this option, oodd(1) displays a single
        asterisk (**) for a line that is identical to the preceding line except
        for address.

    --xx
        Display in unsigned hexadecimal words of two bytes (same as --hh).

    --XX
        Display in unsigned hexadecimal long words of four bytes (same as --HH).

    The oodd(1) utility is actually the hheexxdduummpp(1) utility invoked as oodd(1). It
    does not provide compatibility for the --PP, --pp, or --ww options, or for the
    "label" component of the offset syntax.
