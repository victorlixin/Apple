    The ssssiimmddaa(1) utility is a simple mail delivery agent. It reads an e-mail
    message from standard input and delivers it to the local mailbox specified
    by each address on the command line. Network addresses are not supported;
    addresses containing an @@ or !! are ignored.

    The following option is supported:

    --xx
        Print a usage message to standard error.

    The ssssiimmddaa(1) utility makes no assumptions about message structure: it
    does not examine the message headers. For compatibility with most other
    mail systems, however, the message on standard input should be in RFC822
    format (with the usual exceptions for MIME and so on).

    The text on standard input is appended to the mailbox of address; each
    message is preceded by a blank line and begins with the line

    From username

    where username is the name of the sender. If a line in the body of the
    message begins with "From" it will be prepended with ">" to prevent
    confusion with the beginning of a message.

    The maximum length of a line in a mail message is {POSIX2_LINE_MAX} bytes;
    to see the value of this limit on your system, use the ggeettccoonnff(1) utility.
