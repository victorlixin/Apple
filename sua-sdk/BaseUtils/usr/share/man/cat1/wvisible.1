    The wwvviissiibbllee(1) utility tests to determine whether the current window
    station is visible. If so, it exits with 0 status; otherwise, it exits
    with a non-zero status. If the --vv flag is specified, wwvviissiibbllee(1) prints a
    message to stdout indicating whether the current window station is
    visible.

    The wwvviissiibbllee(1) utility is intended to be used by shell scripts as
    follows:

    if wvisible
    then
         # run a win32 gui program
    fi

    The term "window station" is peculiar to Windows. Every Win32 process is
    associated with a window station object. If the window station is visible,
    Win32 windows will be displayed on the computer's video display, and the
    user can interact with these windows using the keyboard and mouse. If the
    window station is not visible, Win32 windows are invisible and non-
    interactive.

    The current window station is not visible if you are logged in over a
    Telnet connection or through some kinds of pseudo-tty connections. The
    most common situation in which the current window station is not visible
    is when you log into a computer using Telnet. From a Telnet session, any
    Win32 windows you create will not be visible to someone using the mouse
    and video display. This is a security feature; it is intended to prevent
    trojan horses.

    The wwvviissiibbllee(1) utility exits with status 0 if the current window station
    is visible, and >0 if it is not, or if an error occurred.
