    The fflliipp(1) utility is a file interchange program that converts text-file
    formats between POSIX and other formats (MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh). The
    fflliipp(1) utility converts lines ending with carriage-return (CR) and
    linefeed (LF) (MS-DOS) or just carriage-return (Apple) to lines ending
    with just linefeed, or vice versa.

    If no file is specified, or if the file is specified as -, fflliipp(1) reads
    the standard input. When fflliipp(1) reads from standard input, it writes to
    standard output. If you mix files and standard input in the list of
    operands, files are converted in place and standard input is converted and
    then written to standard output.

    *     If a file contains isolated CR characters for underlining or
          overprinting, fflliipp(1) does not change them.
    *     When asked to convert a file to the same format that it already has,
          fflliipp(1) causes no change to the file. Thus, to convert all files to
          POSIX format you can type:
          $$ flip -u *.*  (under MS-DOS)
          $$ flip -u * *  (under POSIX)
          The resulting files will be in the correct format, regardless of
          whether they were originally in MS-DOS or in POSIX format. This also
          works in the opposite direction.
    *     The fflliipp(1) utility preserves file timestamps. You can override
          this, however.
    *     The fflliipp(1) utility is written in C and will compile and run under
          MS-DOS/Turbo C, 4.3BSD, and System V.
    *     The fflliipp(1) utility accepts wildcards and multiple file names on the
          command line.
    *     If a user interrupt aborts fflliipp(1), it does not leave behind any
          garbage files or cause corruption of the files being converted.
    *     The fflliipp(1) utility will not usually convert binary files. You can
          override this.
    *     When converting from MS-DOS to POSIX format, fflliipp(1) removes any
          trailing control-Z (the last character in the file), but leaves
          embedded control-Z characters unchanged. This reduces the
          possibility of accidentally converting a binary file that contains a
          control-Z near the beginning. You can override this and ask fflliipp(1)
          to recognize the first control-Z found as end-of-file.
    *     The fflliipp(1) utility can be asked to strip the high (parity) bit as
          it converts a file.

    The fflliipp(1) utility is normally invoked as:

    flip -umhvtb file ...

    One of the following is required: --AA, --aa, --uu, --mm, or --hh. Switches can be
    given separately or combined together after a dash. For example, the three
    command lines given below are equivalent:

    flip -uvt *.c
    flip -u -v -t *.c
    flip -u -vt *.c

    The meanings of the switches are as follows.

    --aa
        Convert from POSIX to Apple format (LF => CR).

    --AA
        Convert from Apple to POSIX format (CR => LF).

    --bb
        Also convert binary files. (Otherwise, binary files are left
        unchanged.)

    --hh
        Display a help message.

    --mm
        Convert from POSIX format to MS-DOS format (lone LF => CR LF, lone CR
        unchanged).

    --MM
        Convert from MS-DOS format to POSIX format (CR LF => LF, lone CR or LF
        unchanged, trailing control-Z removed, embedded control-Z unchanged).

    --nn
        Remove all NUL characters during the conversion.

    --pp
        Print all output to stdout. Files named on the command line are
        unchanged.

    --qq
        Quiet mode. Suppress all messages.

    --ss
        Strip high bit.

    --tt
        Touch files (do not preserve timestamps).

    --uu
        Convert from MS-DOS to POSIX format (CR LF => LF, lone CR or LF
        unchanged, trailing control-Z removed, embedded control-Z unchanged).
        This option is identical to --MM.

    --vv
        Verbose option, print file names to standard error as they are
        processed.

    --zz
        Truncate file at first control-Z encountered.

    On systems that allow a program to know its own name, fflliipp(1) can be
    renamed (or linked) to a file called ttooiixx(1) for conversion to POSIX
    format, or to a file called ttoommss(1) for conversion to MS-DOS format. When
    invoked with the name ttooiixx(1) or ttoommss(1), fflliipp(1) will act as though it
    were invoked with the --uu or --mm option, respectively.
