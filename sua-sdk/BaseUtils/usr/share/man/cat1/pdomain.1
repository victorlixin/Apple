    The ppddoommaaiinn(1) utility retrieves the name of the computer's principal
    domain using the _gg_ee_tt_pp_dd_oo_mm_aa_ii_nn(2) call, and prints it on standard output. It
    is useful in scripts.

    On Windows, a user's full login name consists of a domain name plus a user
    name. Any user names presented without a domain name are assumed to belong
    to the principal domain. For example, if the principal domain is SERVICES,
    the user SERVICES+dana is displayed as dana. On input, the name dana is
    taken as synonymous with SERVICES+dana.

    A user named dana in a different domain is still displayed in the
    canonical form, such as DEV+dana. If your principal domain is SERVICES and
    you need to refer to the user DEV+dana, the canonical name still works.
