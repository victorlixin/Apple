    The utility wwhhoo(1) displays information about users currently logged in to
    the computer. Without options, wwhhoo(1) shows for each user the login name,
    terminal line, and login time. Options display additional information.

    The last two forms,

    who am i
    who am I

    are equivalent to

    who -m

    By default, wwhhoo(1) gathers information from the file //vvaarr//aaddmm//uuttmmppxx. You
    can specify an alternate file (usually //vvaarr//aaddmm//wwttmmppxx) as the source of
    the information.

    The general format of the output is:

    name [[state]] line time [[activity]] [[pid]] [[host]] [[exit]]

    Where the values are:

    name
        The user's login name.

    state
        The state of the terminal; see the description of the --TT option.

    line
        The number of the terminal line (the file under //ddeevv).

    time
        Login time.

    activity
        The number of hours and minutes since activity last occurred. A dot
        (.) indicates activity within the last minute; the string <old>
        indicates that no activity has occurred for 24 hours.

    pid
        The process identifier of the user's login process.

    host
        The name of the host computer, if --ff is specified.

    exit
        The exit status of dead processes.

    Available options:

    --aa
        Display all utmpx record types; this is similar to the union of
        options --bbddpprrtt. Options that control control how things are displayed
        are not affected.

    --bb
        Display time and date of last system reboot.

    --dd
        Display list of dead processes (processes that have expired). This
        information is displayed in the exit field of the output. On
        traditional systems, this option lists processes that have not been
        respawned by iinniitt(1); since Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications 
		does not have a traditional UNIX iinniitt(1) process, --dd lists 
		only dead processes.

    --ff
        Display the name of the host as the last field in the output.

    --HH
        Write column headings above the regular output.

    --ll
        (The letter ell.) Display terminal lines waiting for someone to login.
        The name field is displayed as LOGIN. This information is not
        currently stored in Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, so this 
		option is not yet useful.

    --mm
        Return information about the current terminal only.

    --pp
        List any other process that is currently active and that was spawned
        by iinniitt(1). Because Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications 
		does not have a traditional iinniitt(1) process, this option 
		is not useful.

    --qq
        Quick output: list only the names and number of users currently logged
        on. When this option is used, all other options are ignored.

    --rr
        Display current run-level of the iinniitt(1) process. Because 
		Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications does not have a traditional 
		iinniitt(1) process, this option produces nothing.

    --ss
        List only the name, line, and time fields. This is the default
        behavior for wwhhoo(1).

    --tt
        Display the last change to the system clock. This information is not
        currently stored in Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, so this option is not yet
        usable.

    --TT
        Display the message state of each terminal; a terminal state is
        indicated by the characters ++, --, and ??, defined in the following
        list.

        ++
            Other users can send messages to the terminal.

        --
            Other users cannot send messages to the terminal.

        ??
            The state cannot be determined.

    --uu
        Displays idle time for each user; idle time is the time that has
        elapsed since any activity occurred at the user's terminal.

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    The wwhhoo(1) utility returns 0 when it succeeds, and >0 if an error occurs.

  FFIILLEESS

    The following files are used by wwhhoo(1):

    //vvaarr//aaddmm//uuttmmppxx
        A database of system users.

    //vvaarr//aaddmm//wwttmmppxx
        Database of the history of system users.
