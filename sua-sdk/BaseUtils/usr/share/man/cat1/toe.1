    With no options, ttooee(1) lists all available terminal types by primary name
    with descriptions.

    File arguments specify the directories to be scanned; if no such arguments
    are given, your default terminfo directory is scanned. If you also specify
    the --hh option, a directory header will be issued as each directory is
    entered.

    There are other options intended for use by terminfo file maintainers:
    --uu file
        Issue a report on dependencies in the given file. This report
        condenses the 'use' relation: each line consists of the primary name
        of a terminal that has use capabilities, followed by a colon, followed
        by the white-space-separated primary names of all terminals that occur
        in those use capabilities, followed by a newline
    --UU file
        Issue a report on reverse dependencies in the given file. This report
        reverses the 'use' relation: each line consists of the primary name of
        a terminal that occurs in use capabilities, followed by a colon,
        followed by the white-space-separated primary names of all terminals
        that depend on it, followed by a newline.
    --vvn
        Write (verbose) output to standard error trace information showing
        ttooee(1)'s progress. The optional integer n is a number from 1 to 10,
        interpreted as for ttiicc(1).

    --VV
        Prints out the version of the program in use on standard error and
        exits.
