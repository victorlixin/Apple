    The mmaakkeeddeevv(1) utility creates all standard device special files supported
    by Interix. The device files are created in the //ddeevv directory; any
    existing files in that directory or any subdirectories with names that
    conflict with the standard special file names are removed and replaced
    with the appropriate device files.

    You must be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to run
    mmaakkeeddeevv(1), otherwise the utility displays an error message and exits.

    Interix recognizes the files created by mmkknnoodd(1) as unique. Superficially
    identical files created through means other than mmkknnoodd(1), mmkknnoodd(2), and
    mmaakkeeddeevv(1) (for example, through backup and restore) will not be treated
    as device files by Interix, and attempts to open devices through such
    files with fail with the error code ENXIO.

    If the standard device special files become corrupted for any reason, the
    mmaakkeeddeevv(1) utility will recreate them in such a way that Interix will
    recognize them as valid. Any additional (that is, nonstandard) device
    files created by users must be recreated using mmkknnoodd(1) or mmkknnoodd(2).

    You also use mmaakkeeddeevv in the unlikely situation that the iinnooddee security
    file has been damaged. If it has, all existing device special files are
    invalidated and must be recreated. (The information returned concerning
    them by the llss --ll command remains correct, but they will not be recognized
    as valid by _oo_pp_ee_nn(2).) The command mmaakkeeddeevv --ff should be used under these
    circumstances, and if device special files have been created elsewhere on
    the file system, those files also must be be refreshed manually.

    The mmaakkeeddeevv utility accepts this option:

    --ff
        Force the recreation of the //ddeevv//nnuullll and //ddeevv//ttttyy files. These are
        likely to be in use if the system is active, and the recreation will
        usually succeed. However, it may leave some inconstencies that can be
        cleaned up by or after a reboot. Precisely what inconsistencies are
        left varies depending on the circumstances. After you restart the
        system, if there are no unexpected entries in /dev, then all is well.
