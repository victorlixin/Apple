    The iidd(1) utility displays the user and group names and numeric
    identifiers (IDs) of the calling process to the standard output. If the
    real and effective IDs are different, both are displayed; otherwise, only
    the real ID is displayed.

    If you specify a user (by logon name or user ID), iidd(1) displays the user
    and group IDs of that user. In this case, the real and effective IDs are
    assumed to be the same.

    --DD
        Prefixes the name of the domain to user and group names. Without this
        option, the domain is prefixed to the name only if the user or group
        does not belong to the principal domain of the system.

    --GG
        Display the different group IDs (effective, real and supplementary) as
        white-space separated numbers, in no particular order.

    --gg
        Display the effective group ID as a number.

    --nn
        Display the name of the user or group ID for the --GG, --gg and --uu options
        instead of the number. If any of the ID numbers cannot be mapped into
        names, the number will be displayed as usual. Names are displayed in
        the following format:
        name            The user or group belongs to the system's
                        principal domain.

        ++name           The user or group is a built-in (well-known)
                        user or group, such as Everyone.

        domain++name     The user or group belongs to a domain other than
                        the principal domain.

    --pp
        Print output in a "pretty" format which consists of up to five lines:
        login  login_name
        uid    real_user_name
        euid   effective_user_name
        rgid   real_group_name
        groups group_list
        *     login_name is obtained from _gg_ee_tt_ll_oo_gg_ii_nn(2).
        *     real_user_name is obtained from getpwuid(getuid())
        *     effective_user_name is obtained from getpwuid(geteuid())
        *     real_group_name is obtained from getgrgid(getgid())
        *     group_list is the list of groups the user is a member of.
        If login_name is the same as real_user_name then the login line is not
        printed. If the real and effective usernames are the same, then the
        euid line is not printed. If real and effective groupnames are the
        same, then the rgid line is not printed. If a 'user is specified on
        the command line, then only the uid and groups lines are printed.
        Note that ggeettllooggiinn(2) always returns a fully qualified user name
        (domain++user). Fully qualified names for real_user_name,
        effective_user_name, real_group_name, and group_list may or not be
        displayed depending if the name is from the principal domain or not.
        Use the --DD option to force the use of fully qualified names.

    --rr
        Display the real ID for the --gg and --uu options instead of the effective
        ID.

    --uu
        Display the effective user ID as a number.
