    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    The eexxppoorrtt(1) command sets the export attribute of the named parameters.
    Exported parameters are passed in the environment to executed commands. If
    values are specified, the named parameters are also assigned.

    If no parameters are specified, the names of all parameters with the
    export attribute are printed one per line, unless the --pp option is used,
    in which case eexxppoorrtt(1) commands defining all exported parameters,
    including their values, are printed.
