    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    Without options, the first form lists all bound keys and the editor
    command to which each is bound; the second form lists the editor command
    to which key is bound; the third form binds the editor command command to
    key.

    key may be a single character or a string. If a command is bound to a
    string, the first character of the string is bound to sseeqquueennccee--lleeaadd--iinn and
    the entire string is bound to the command.

    Control characters in key can be literal (they can be typed by preceding
    them with the editor command qquuootteedd--iinnsseerrtt, normally bound to '^V') or
    written caret-character style, such as '^A'. Delete is written '^?'
    (caret-question mark). key and command can contain backslashed escape
    sequences (in the style of System V eecchhoo(1)) as follows:

    \\aa
        Bell

    \\bb
        Backspace

    \\ee
        Escape

    \\ff
        Form feed

    \\nn
        Newline

    \\rr
        Carriage return

    \\tt
        Horizontal tab

    \\vv
        Vertical tab
    \\nnn
        The ASCII character corresponding to the octal number nnn

    \\ nullifies the special meaning of the following character, if it has any,
    notably \\ and ^^.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --ll
        Lists all editor commands and a short description of each.

    --dd
        Binds all keys to the standard bindings for the default editor.

    --ee
        Binds all keys to the standard GNU Emacs-like bindings.

    --vv
        Binds all keys to the standard vvii(1)-like bindings.

    --aa
        Lists or changes key bindings in the alternative key map. This is the
        key map used in vvii(1) command mode.

    --bb
        key is interpreted as a control character written ^character (such as
        '^A') or C-character (such as 'C-A'), a meta-character written M-
        character (such as 'M-A'), a function key written F-string (such as
        'F-string'), or an extended prefix key written X-character (such as
        'X-A').

    --kk
        key is interpreted as a symbolic arrow key name, which may be 'down',
        'up', 'left' or 'right'.

    --rr
        Removes key's binding. Be careful: 'bindkey -r' does not bind key to
        sseellff--iinnsseerrtt--ccoommmmaanndd; it unbinds key completely.

    --cc
        command is interpreted as a built-in or external command instead of an
        editor command.

    --ss
        command is taken as a literal string and treated as terminal input
        when key is typed. Bound keys in command are themselves reinterpreted;
        this continues for ten levels of interpretation.

    ----
        Forces a break from option processing, so the next word is taken as
        key even if it begins with '-'.
    --uu (or any invalid option)
        Prints a usage message.
