    The uulliimmiitt(1) command is a built-in Korn shell (kksshh(1)) command that
    displays or sets process limits. The Korn shell supports, through
    uulliimmiitt(1), all limits defined by the sseettrrlliimmiitt(2).

    If no options are used, the file size limit (--ff) is assumed. The value n,
    if specified, can be either an arithmetic expression or the word
    "unlimited." The limits affect the shell and any processes created by the
    shell after a limit is imposed. Note that some systems might not allow
    limits to be increased once they are set.

    --aa
        Displays all limits; unless --HH is used, soft limits are displayed.
    --cc n
        Impose a size limit of n blocks on the size of core dumps.
    --dd n
        Impose a size limit of n kilobytes on the size of the data area.
    --ff n
        Impose a size limit of n blocks on files written by the shell and its
        child processes (files of any size can be read).

    --HH
        Set the hard limit only (default is to set both hard and soft limits).
    --nn n
        Impose a limit of n file descriptors that can be open at once.
    --ss n
        Impose a size limit of n kilobytes on the size of the stack area.

    --SS
        Set the soft limit only (default is to set both hard and soft limits).
    --tt n
        Impose a time limit of n CPU seconds to be used by each process.
    --vv n
        Impose a limit of n kilobytes on the amount of virtual memory used; on
        some systems this is the maximum allowable virtual address (in bytes,
        not kilobytes).
