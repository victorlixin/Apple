    The cchhmmoodd(1) utility modifies the file-mode bits of the listed files as
    specified by the mode operand.

  OOPPTTIIOONN

     --HH
        If the --RR option is also specified, symbolic links on the command
        line are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree
        traversal are not followed.)

     --LL
        If the --RR option is also specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     --PP
        If the --RR option is also specified, no symbolic links are followed.

    --RR
        Change the modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the files instead
        of just the files themselves.

     Symbolic links do not have modes, so unless the --HH or --LL option is set,
     cchhmmoodd on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect. The --HH, --LL,
     and --PP options are ignored unless the --RR option is specified. In addi-
     tion, these options override each other and the command's actions are
     determined by the last one specified.

    Only the owner of a file or a user with appropriate privileges can change
    the mode of a file.

  MMOODDEESS

    Modes may be absolute or symbolic. An absolute mode is an octal number
    constructed by or-ing the following values:

    4000     set-user-ID-on-execution; see NOTES later in this topic

    2000     set-group-ID-on-execution; see NOTES later in this topic

    1000     sticky bit, see _cc_hh_mm_oo_dd(2)

    0400     read by owner

    0200     write by owner

    0100     execute (or search for directories) by owner

    0040     read by group

    0020     write by group

    0010     execute/search by group

    0004     read by others

    0002     write by others

    0001     execute/search by others

    The read, write, and execute/search values for group and others are
    encoded as described for owner.

    The symbolic mode is described by the following grammar:

    mode         ::= clause [, clause ...]
    clause       ::= [who ...] [action ...] last_action
    action       ::= op [perm ...]
    last_action  ::= op [perm ...]
    who          ::= a | u | g | o
    op           ::= + | - | =
    perm         ::= r | w | x | X | u | g | o

    The who symbols (uu, gg, and oo) specify the user, group, and other parts of
    the mode bits, respectively. The who symbol aa is equivalent to uuggoo.

    The perm symbols represent the portions of the mode bits as follows:

    rr     The read bits.

    ss     The set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution bits;
          see NOTES later in this topic.

    tt     The sticky bit.

    ww     The write bits.

    xx     The execute/search bits.

    XX     The execute/search bits if the file is a directory or any of the
          execute/search bits are set in the original (unmodified) mode.
          Operations with the perm symbol XX are only meaningful in
          conjunction with the op symbol ++, and are ignored in all other
          cases.

    uu     User permission bits in the original file's mode.

    gg     Group permission bits in the original file's mode.

    oo     Other permission bits in the original file's mode.

    The op symbols represent the operation performed, as follows:

    ++     If no value is supplied for perm, the ++ operation has no
          effect. If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
          specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the
          file-mode creation mask is clear, is set. Otherwise, the mode
          bits represented by the specified who and perm values are set.

    --     If no value is supplied for perm, the -- operation has no
          effect. If no value is supplied for who, each permission bit
          specified in perm, for which the corresponding bit in the
          file-mode creation mask is clear, is cleared. Otherwise, the
          mode bits represented by the specified who and perm values are
          cleared.

    ==     The mode bits specified by the who value are cleared, or, if
          no who value is specified, the owner, group and other mode
          bits are cleared. Then, if no value is supplied for who, each
          permission bit specified in perm, for which the corresponding
          bit in the file mode creation mask is clear, is set.
          Otherwise, the mode bits represented by the specified who and
          perm values are set.

    Each clause specifies one or more operations to be performed on the mode
    bits, and each operation is applied to the mode bits in the order
    specified.

    Operations upon the other permissions only (specified by the symbol oo by
    itself), in combination with the perm symbols ss or tt, are ignored.

    The following are example permission modes:

    644              Make a file readable by anyone and writeable by the
                     owner only.

    go-w             Deny write permission to group and others.

    =rw,+X           Set the read-and-write permissions to the usual
                     defaults, but retain any execute permissions that are
                     currently set.

    +X               Make a directory or file searchable/executable by
                     everyone if it is already searchable/executable by
                     anyone.

    755              Make a file readable/executable by everyone and
                     writeable by the owner only.

    u=rwx,go=u-w     Same as 755

    u=rwx,go=rx      Same as 755

    go=              Clear all mode bits for the group and others.

    g=u-w            Set the group bits equal to the user bits, but clear
                     the group write bit.

    By default, the system does not execute files with the set-user-ID (setuid)
    or set-group-ID (setgid) mode bit set for security reasons. If an attempt
    is made to execute such a file, the ENOSETUID error is returned. For more
    information and and instructions for enabling execution of files with
    these mode bits set, see _T_h_e_ _s_u_p_e_r_u_s_e_r_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_ _a_n_d_ _a_p_p_r_o_p_r_i_a_t_e_ _p_r_i_v_i_l_e_g_e_s
