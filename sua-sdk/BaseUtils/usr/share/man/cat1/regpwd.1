    The rreeggppwwdd(1) utility stores a copy of your password in a protected area
    accessible only by privileged processes. This password can then be used by
    privileged programs that impersonate the user, including 
	Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA) _cc_rr_oo_nn(1),
    _rr_ll_oo_gg_ii_nn_dd(1), and _rr_ss_hh_dd(1), as well as Windows _cc_rr_oo_nn(1w) and Remote Shell
    service (_rr_ss_hh_ss_vv_cc(1w)).

    The rreeggppwwdd utility prompts you for your password; type the password you
    used to log on the computer. This utility stores the password for use by
    the utilities listed above when you run them while logged on with the same
    user account. It does not change your password for the user account
    itself. Whenever you change your password, you must run rreeggppwwdd again to
    store your new password.

    occurs.

    store the user's password.
