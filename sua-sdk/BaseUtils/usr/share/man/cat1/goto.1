    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The ggoottoo(1) command continues script execution on the line identified by
    name, which is file-name and command substituted to yield a string of the
    form 'label'. The shell rewinds its input as much as possible, searches
    for a line of the form 'label:', possibly preceded by blanks or tabs, and
    continues execution after that line.
