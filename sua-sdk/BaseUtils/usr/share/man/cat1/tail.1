    The ttaaiill(1) utility displays the contents of file or, by default, its
    standard input, to the standard output.

    The display begins at a byte, line or 512-byte block location in the
    input. Numbers having a leading plus (++) sign are relative to the
    beginning of the input; for example, ttaaiill --cc ++22 or ttaaiill ++22ccstarts the
    display at the second byte of the input. Numbers having a leading minus (--
    ) sign or, when used with --cc or --nn, no explicit sign are relative to the
    end of the input; for example, ttaaiill --nn 22 or ttaaiill --22 displays the last two
    lines of the input. The default starting location is --1100, or the last 10
    lines of the input.

    The options are as follows:

    --ff
        The --ff option causes ttaaiill(1) to not stop when end of file is reached,
        but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input.
        The --ff option is ignored if the standard input is a pipe, but not if
        it is a first-in-first-out (FIFO).

    --rr
        Display the input in reverse order, by line. Additionally, this option
        changes the meaning of the --bb, --cc and --nn options. When the --rr option
        is specified, these options specify the number of bytes, lines or 512-
        byte blocks to display, instead of the bytes, lines or blocks from the
        beginning or end of the input from which to begin the display. The
        default for the --rr option is to display all of the input.
    --cc number
        The location is number bytes.
    --nn number
        The location is number lines.
    --kk number
        Display the last number kilobytes (1024 bytes) of the file.

    --mm nnuummbbeerr
        Display the last number megabytes (1,048,576 bytes) of the file.
    ++[number] [bb | cc | ll][ff] [file]
    - [number] [bb | cc | ll][ff] [file]
        The interpretation of number depends on which letter, if any, follow
        number: bb indicates 512-byte blocks; cc indicates bytes, and ll
        indicates lines. Adding ff causes ttaaiill(1) to not stop when end of file
        is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to
        the input. The ff option is ignored if the standard input is a pipe,
        but not if it is a first-in-first-out (FIFO).

    The --ll number option, which is found in some implementations of UNIX, is
    not standard and is not supported. Instead, use the --nn number option,
    which has the same functionality.

    If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a header
    consisting of the string ====>> filename <<==== where filename is the name of
    the file.
