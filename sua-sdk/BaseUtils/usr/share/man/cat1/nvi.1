    The vvii(1) utility is a screen-oriented text editor; eexx(1) is a line-
    oriented text editor. The eexx(1) and vvii(1) utilities are different
    interfaces to the same program; it is possible to switch back and forth
    between them during an editing session. The vviieeww utility is the equivalent
    of using the --RR (read-only) option of vvii.

    The information in this topic is also provided in the manual page that
    accompanies the nnvvii version of the eexx and vvii text editors. The nnvvii utility
    is intended as a bug-for-bug compatible replacement for the original
    Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD) eexx(1) and vvii(1) programs. For
    the rest of this topic, nnvvii is used only when it is necessary to
    distinguish them from the historic implementations of eexx and vvii.

    The information in this topic is most suitable for users already familiar
    with eexx/vvii. If you are unfamiliar with eexx/vvii, it is recommended that you
    read a good tutorial on these editors to get some background information
    about them before reading this topic. If you are in an unfamiliar
    environment, however, and you must get work done immediately, read the
    section after Options, entitled Fast Startup.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    ++cmd
    --cc cmd
        Execute cmd immediately after starting the edit session. This can be
        useful for initial positioning in the file; however, cmd is not
        limited to positioning commands. This is the POSIX 1003.2 interface
        for the historic +ccmmdd syntax. The nnvvii utility supports both the old
        and new syntax.

    --ee
        Start editing in eexx mode, as if the command name were eexx.

    --FF
        Do not copy the entire file when first starting to edit. (The default
        is to copy the file in case someone else modifies the file during your
        edit session.)

    --ll
        Start editing with the lliisspp and sshhoowwmmaattcchh options set.

    --RR
        Start editing in read-only mode, as if the command name were vviieeww, or
        the rreeaaddoonnllyy option were set.

    --rr
        Recover the specified files, or, if no files are specified, list the
        files that could be recovered. If no recoverable files by the
        specified name exist, the file is edited as if the --rr option had not
        been specified.

    --ss
        Enter batch mode; applicable only to eexx(1) edit sessions. Batch mode
        is useful when running eexx(1) scripts. Prompts, informative messages
        and other user-oriented messages are turned off, and no startup files
        or environment variables are read. This is the POSIX 1003.2 interface
        for the historic - argument. The nnvvii utility supports both the old and
        new syntax.

    --tt
        Start editing at the specified tag. (See ccttaaggss(1)).

    --ww
        Set the initial window size to the specified number of lines.

    --vv
        Start editing in vvii mode, as if the command name were vvii(1) or
        vviieeww(1).

    --WW
        Start editing with the wwiinnddoowwsstteexxtt option set.

    Command input for eexx/vvii is read from the standard input. In the vvii(1)
    interface, it is an error if standard input is not a terminal. In the
    eexx(1) interface, if standard input is not a terminal, eexx(1) will read
    commands from it regardless. The session will be a batch-mode session,
    however, exactly as though the --ss option had been specified.

  FFAASSTT SSTTAARRTTUUPP

    This section provides the minimum amount of information that you need in
    order to do simple editing tasks using vvii. If you have not used any screen
    editor before, you are likely to have problems even with this simple
    introduction, however. It is therefore recommended that you find someone
    who already knows vvii(1) for assistance with this section.

    The vvii(1) utility is a screen editor. This means that it occupies almost
    the entire screen, displaying part of the file on each screen line, except
    the last line of the screen, which provides space for you to give commands
    to vvii(1), and for vvii(1) to give information to you.

    It is important to note that vvii(1)is a modeful editor; that is, when using
    vvii(1), you are either entering text or executing commands, and you must be
    in the right mode to do one or the other. You will be in command mode when
    you first start editing a file. There are commands that switch you into
    input mode. There is only one key that takes you out of input mode, and
    that is the <escape> key. (Key names are written using less-than and
    greater-than signs; for example, <escape> means the escape key, usually
    labeled Esc on your keyboard.) If you are ever confused as to which mode
    you are in, press the <escape> key repeatedly until vvii(1) beeps.
    (Generally, vvii(1)beeps if you try and do something that is not allowed. It
    will also display error messages.)

    To start editing a file, enter the command:
    vvii file_name<carriage-return>
    As soon as you start editing, enter the command:
    sseett vveerrbboossee sshhoowwmmooddee<carriage-return>
    This will cause the editor to give you verbose error messages and display
    the current mode at the bottom of the screen.

    Use the following commands to move the cursor from one place to another in
    the file:

    hh
        Move the cursor left one character.

    jj
        Move the cursor down one line.

    kk
        Move the cursor up one line.

    ll
        Move the cursor right one character.

    <<ccuurrssoorr--aarrrroowwss>>
        The cursor arrow keys should work, too.

    //tteexxtt<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
        Search for the string text in the file and move the cursor to its
        first character.

    Use the following commands to enter new text:

    aa
        Append new text after the cursor.

    ii
        Insert new text before the cursor.

    oo
        Open a new line below the line the cursor is on, and start entering
        text.

    OO
        Open a new line above the line the cursor is on, and start entering
        text.

    <<eessccaappee>>
        Once you have entered input mode using one of the commands aa, ii, OO or
        oo, use <<eessccaappee>> to quit entering text and return to command mode.

    Use the following commands to copy text:

    yyyy
        Copy the line the cursor is on.

    pp
        Append the copied line after the line the cursor is on.

    Use the following commands to delete text:

    dddd
        Delete the line the cursor is on.

    xx
        Delete the character the cursor is on.

    Use the following commands to write the file:

    ::ww<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
        Write the file back to the file with the name that you originally used
        as an argument on the vvii(1) command line.
    ::ww file_name<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
        Write the file back to the file with the name file_name.

    Use the following commands to to quit editing and exit the editor:

    ::qq<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
        Quit editing and leave vvii(1). If you have modified the file but not
        saved your changes, vvii(1) will refuse to quit.

    ::qq!!<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
        Quit, discarding any modifications that you may have made.

    One final caution: unusual characters can take up more than one column on
    the screen, and long lines can take up more than a single screen line. The
    above commands work on physical characters and lines; that is, they affect
    the entire line no matter how many screen lines it takes up and the entire
    character no matter how many screen columns it takes up.

    The following section describes the commands available in the eexx(1)
    editor. In each entry below, the tag line is a usage synopsis for the
    command.

    The flags argument listed for many commands is any combination of the
    characters.

    pp
        Print the affected line(s) to the screen, as if it had been selected
        by the pprriinntt command.
    ll (the lowercase letter el)
        List the affected line(s) to the screen, as if it had been selected by

        Print the affected line(s) to the screen as if it had been selected by
        the nnuummbbeerr command, displaying line numbers.

    These flags can be further modified by adding a number of ++ or --
    characters after the command but before the flags. These determine which
    line is displayed or which line is the current line after the command.

    As an extension to historical vvii(1) implementations, if the commands eexx,
    eeddiitt, nneexxtt, pprreevviioouuss, ttaagg, and vviissuuaall are typed with an uppercase letter
    (such as EExx or PPrreevviioouuss), the command happens in a new screen. In
    historical vvii(1), an uppercase PP command had no special meaning.

    [range] ~~ [options] [count] [flags]
        Make substitutions. In the substitution string, the characters ~~ and %%
        may have special meanings. If the entire replace pattern is a percent
        sign (%%), the previous replacement pattern is used. (This can be
        useful for repeating substitutions that contain back references.) The
        special character ~~ inserts the previous replacement string into this
        replacement string.
        The options can be any of the following:

        cc
            Ask for confirmation before replacing the text.

        gg
            Perform the replacement on all occurrences of the regular
            expression on the line.

        rr
            If no regular expression was specified, use the most recent
            regular expression (used for a search) rather than the same
            regular expression as used for the last substitute command.

        For vvii(1) mode only. Edit a new file; vvii(1) opens a new edit session
        in half of the screen window (the half without the cursor). Executing
        the VVii command again subdivides this smaller window. To return to the
        parent window/file, quit the vvii(1) session (with qq or QQ or ZZZZ). This
        is an extension to traditional vvii(1).

  SSEETT OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    There many options available that you can set (or unset) to change the
    behavior of the editor. This section describes the options, their
    abbreviations and their default values.

    In each entry below, the first part of the tag line is the full name of
    the option, followed by any equivalent abbreviations. The information in
    square brackets is the default value of the option. Most of the options
    are boolean: they are either on or off, and do not have an associated
    value.

    Options apply to both eexx(1) and vvii(1) modes, unless otherwise specified.
    sshhoowwmmaattcchh,, ssmm [ooffff]

        be restored on editor exit.

    wwiinnddoowwsstteexxtt
        On input, replaces all carriage-return/linefeed character pairs (\\rr\\nn)
        to a single linefeed character (\\nn); on ouptut, converts each linefeed
        character to a carriage-return/linefeed character pair.
    wwrraapplleenn,, wwll [00]
        For vvii(1) only. Break lines automatically, the specified number of
        columns from the left-hand margin. If both the wwrraapplleenn and wwrraappmmaarrggiinn
        edit options are set, the wwrraappmmaarrggiinn value is used.
    wwrraappmmaarrggiinn,, wwmm [00]
        For vvii(1) only. Break lines automatically the specified number of

    occurs.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS

    COLUMNS
        The number of columns on the screen. This value overrides any system
        or terminal specific values. If the COLUMNS environment variable is
        not set when eexx/vvii runs, or the ccoolluummnnss option is explicitly reset by
        the user, eexx enters the value into the environment.

    EXINIT
        A list of eexx(1) startup commands, read if the variable NEXINIT is not
        set.

    HOME
        The user's home directory, used as the initial directory path for the
        startup $HOME/.nexrc and $HOME/.exrc files. This value is also used as
        the default directory for the vvii(1) ccdd command.

    LINES
        The number of rows on the screen. This value overrides any system or
        terminal-specific values. If the LINES environment variable is not set
        when eexx/vvii runs, or the lliinneess option is explicitly reset by the user,
        eexx/vvii enters the value into the environment.

    NEXINIT
        A list of eexx(1) startup commands.

    SHELL
        The user's shell of choice (see also the sshheellll option).

    TERM
        The user's terminal type. The default is the type unknown. If the TERM
        environment variable is not set when eexx/vvii runs, or the tteerrmm option is
        explicitly reset by the user, eexx/vvii enters the value into the
        environment.

    TMPDIR
        The location used to stored temporary files (see also the ddiirreeccttoorryy
        edit option).

  AASSYYNNCCHHRROONNOOUUSS EEVVEENNTTSS

    SIGALRM
        The eexx/vviiutility uses this signal for periodic backups of file
        modifications and to display busy messages when operations are likely
        to take a long time.

    SIGHUP

    SIGTERM
        If the current buffer has changed since it was last written in its
        entirety, the editor attempts to save the modified file so it can be
        later recovered. See the eexx/vvii rreferenreferencesection entitled
        "Recovery" for more information.

    SIGINT
        When an interrupt occurs, the current operation is halted, and the
        editor returns to the command level. If interrupted during text input,
        the text already input is resolved into the file as if the text input
        had been normally terminated.

    SIGWINCH
        The screen is resized. See the eexx/vvii reference manual section entitled
        "Sizing the Screen" for more information.

    SIGCONT

    SIGQUIT

    SIGTSTP
        The eexx/vvii utility ignores these signals.

  FFIILLEESS

    The vvii(1) utility uses the following files:

    //bbiinn//sshh
        The default user shell.

    //eettcc//vvii..eexxrrcc
        System-wide vvii(1) startup file.

    //ttmmpp
        Temporary file directory, used if TMPDIR is not defined.

    //ttmmpp//vvii..rreeccoovveerr
        The default recovery file directory.

    $$HHOOMMEE//..nneexxrrcc
        The first choice for user's home directory startup file.

    $$HHOOMMEE//..eexxrrcc
        The second choice for user's home directory startup file.

    ..nneexxrrcc
        The first choice for local directory startup file.

    ..eexxrrcc
