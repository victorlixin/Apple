    The mmtt(1) utility is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.

    If the --hh option is given, a description of the command-line argument
    syntax is written to standard output, and the program exits without
    opening the tape drive.

    If the --ff option is given, tapename specifies which tape drive is to be
    operated upon. The form for tapename must be [//ddeevv//]nnttaappeeN or [//ddeevv//
    ]ttaappeeN, where N is a decimal digit. In this release of 
	Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA), ttaappeeN-type
    devices are treated as though they are nnttaappeeN devices, although in future
    releases of SUA, mmtt(1) may support ttaappeeN devices. For information on
    tape devices supported by SUA, see _t_a_p_e(4).

    If the --ff option is not specified, the tape name is obtained from the TAPE
    environment variable. If that variable is not set, the default tape name
    is //ddeevv//ttaappee00.

    If the --vv option is given, mmtt(1) prints a verbose description of what it
    is doing to standard output. To determine why mmtt(1) takes so long to
    perform some operations on your tape drive, use --vv.

    Following the command-line options is a command name, which can be
    followed by arguments.

    The following commands are supported:
    aannaallyyssee or aannaallyyzzee (synonym for aannaallyyssee))
        Scan the tape and display information about each tape block and each
        file mark found on the tape.

    oonnlliinnee
        Bring the tape unit online.
    rreeaadd file
        Read the tape until a tape mark or end-of-file is reached, and store
        the resulting data in file. The block size used for reading the tape
        is the current block size, as set by
        mt setblk
        The command fails if the current block size is 0. The tape is not
        rewound after the file is read; the tape is left positioned at the
        tape mark or end-of-file.
        The command rreeaadd nnuull will read the tape and discard any information
        read; the result is to forward space to the next tape mark.
        The file argument must use Windows path syntax (for example, C:
        \winnt\notepad.exe). In future releases of SUA, the mmtt(1) utility
        rreeaadd command will support SUA path syntax.

    rreewwiinndd
        Rewind the tape.
    sseettbbllkk count
        Set the block size of the drive to count bytes per record. A count of
        0 means variable length blocks. Use
        mt status
        to determine the minimum, maximum, and default block size (this is
        part of the "tape drive" information), and the current block size
        (this is part of the "tape media" information).
    sseettccmmpp switch
        If switch is set to 1, turn on hardware data compression; if switch is
        set to 0, turn off hardware data compression.

    ssttaattuuss
        Print tape-drive and tape-media parameters to stdout.

    The mmtt(1) utility has an exit status of 0 on success, 1 on a syntax error
    interpreting command line arguments, and 2 on a tape error.
