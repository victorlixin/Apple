    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    For the first form, ffiirrsstt and llaasstt select commands from the history.
    Commands can be selected by history number, or a string specifying the
    most recent command starting with that string. The --ll option lists the
    command on stdout, and --nn inhibits the default command numbers. The --
    rr option reverses the order of the list. Without --ll, the selected commands
    are edited by the editor specified with the --ee option, or if no --ee is
    specified, the editor specified by the FCEDIT parameter (if this parameter
    is not set, //bbiinn//eedd is used), and then executed by the shell.

    The second form re-executes the selected command (the previous command by
    default) after performing the optional substitution of old with new. If --
    gg is specified, all occurrences of old are replaced with new. This command
    is usually accessed with the predefined alias rr==''ffcc --ee --''.
