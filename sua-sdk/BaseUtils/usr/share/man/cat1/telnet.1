  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The tteellnneett(1) command is used to communicate with another host using the
    Telnet protocol. If tteellnneett(1) is invoked without the host argument, it
    enters command mode, indicated by its prompt:

    telnet>

    In this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed in this topic.
    If it is invoked with arguments, it performs an ooppeenn command with those
    arguments.

    If the Telnet Client is installed, a Windows-command version of the tteellnneett 
    command is available. For more information, see _T_e_l_n_e_t_ _C_l_i_e_n_t 
    in the Windows Help for Telnet Client.

    The tteellnneett(1) command uses the following options:

    --88
        Specifies an 8-bit data path. This causes an attempt to negotiate the
        TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.

   --77
        Specifies a 7-bit data path.

    --aa
        Attempt automatic login. Currently, this sends the user name through
        the USER variable of the ENVIRON option if supported by the remote
        system. The name used is that of the current user as returned by
        _g_e_t_l_o_g_i_n(2) if it agrees with the current user identifier (ID),
        otherwise it is the name associated with the user ID.

    --cc
        Disables the reading of the user's ..tteellnneettrrcc file. (See the ttooggggllee
        sskkiipprrcc command in this topic.)

    --dd
        Sets the initial value of the ddeebbuugg toggle to TRUE.

    --DD
        Preserve the environment variable DISPLAY as it is currently.

    --EE
        Stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.
    --eeescape_char
        Sets the initial tteellnneett(1) escape character to escape_char. If
        escape_char is omitted, there will be no escape character.

    --LL
        Specifies an 8-bit data path on output. This causes the BINARY option
        to be negotiated on output.
    --lluser
        When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system understands
        the ENVIRON option, user will be sent to the remote system as the
        value for the variable USER. This option implies the --aa option. This
        option can also be used with the ooppeenn command.
    --nntracefile
        Opens tracefile for recording trace information. See the sseett ttrraacceeffiillee
        command later in this topic.

    --rr
        Specifies a user interface similar to rrllooggiinn(1). In this mode, the
        escape character is set to the tilde (~) character, unless modified by
        the --ee option.
    --SStos
        Sets the Internet Protocol (IP) type-of-service (TOS) option for the
        Telnet connection to the value tos, which can be a numeric TOS value
        or, on systems that support it, a symbolic TOS name found in the //eettcc//
        iippttooss file.
    --XXatype
        Disables the atype type of authentication.

    host
        Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address of a
        remote host.

    port
        Indicates a port number (address of an application). If a number is
        not specified, the default tteellnneett(1) port is used.

    When in rlogin mode, a line of the form ~. disconnects from the remote
    host; ~ is the Telnet escape character. Similarly, the line ~^Z suspends
    the Telnet session. The line ~^] escapes to the normal Telnet escape
    prompt.

    After a connection has been opened, tteellnneett(1) will attempt to enable the
    TELNET LINEMODE option. If this fails, tteellnneett(1) will revert to one of two
    input modes: either character-at-a-time or old line-by-line, depending on
    what the remote system supports.
    *     When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done on the local
          system, under the control of the remote system. When input editing
          or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay
          that information. The remote system will also relay changes to any
          special characters that happen on the remote system so that they can
          take effect on the local system.
    *     In character-at-a-time mode, most text typed is immediately sent to
          the remote host for processing.
    *     In old line-by-line mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally)
          only completed lines are sent to the remote host. The local echo
          character (initially ^E) can be used to turn off and on the local
          echo (this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the
          password being echoed).

    If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the llooccaallcchhaarrss toggle is TRUE
    (the default for old line by line), the user's quit intr and flush
    characters are trapped locally, and sent as TELNET protocol sequences to
    the remote side. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, the user's susp and
    eof are also sent as TELNET protocol sequences, and quit is sent as a
    TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK. There are options (see ttooggggllee aauuttoofflluusshh and
    ttooggggllee aauuttoossyynncchh) that cause this action to flush subsequent output to the
    terminal (until the remote host acknowledges the TELNET sequence) and
    flush previous terminal input (in the case of quit and intr

    While connected to a remote host, tteellnneett(1) command mode can be entered by
    typing the tteellnneett(1) escape character (initially ^]). When in command
    mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.

    The following tteellnneett(1) commands are available. You need only to type
    enough of each command to uniquely identify it (this is also true for
    arguments to the mmooddee, sseett, ttooggggllee, uunnsseett, ssllcc, eennvviirroonn, and ddiissppllaayy
    commands).

    aauutthh argument ...
        The aauutthh command manipulates the information sent through the TELNET
        AUTHENTICATE option. Valid arguments for the aauutthh command are as
        follows:
        ddiissaabbllee type
            Disables the specified type of authentication. To obtain a list of
            available types, use the aauutthh ddiissaabbllee ?? command.
        eennaabbllee type
            Enables the specified type of authentication. To obtain a list of
            available types, use the aauutthh eennaabbllee ?? command.

        ssttaattuuss
            Lists the current status of the various types of authentication.

    cclloossee
        Close a Telnet session and return to command mode.
    ddiissppllaayy argument ...
        Displays all or some of the sseett and ttooggggllee values.

    eennccrryypptt
        The encrypt command manipulates the information sent through the
        TELNET ENCRYPT option.
        Because of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT option is not supported
        outside of the United States and Canada.
        Valid arguments for the encrypt command are as follows:

        ddiissaabbllee
            Disables the specified type of encryption. If you omit the input
            and output, both input and output are disabled. To obtain a list
            of available types, use the eennccrryypptt ddiissaabbllee ?? command.

        eennaabbllee
            Enables the specified type of encryption. If you omit input and
            output, both input and output are enabled. To obtain a list of
            available types, use the eennccrryypptt eennaabbllee ?? command.

        iinnppuutt
            This is the same as the eennccrryypptt ssttaarrtt iinnppuutt command.

        --iinnppuutt
            This is the same as the eennccrryypptt ssttoopp iinnppuutt command.

        oouuttppuutt
            This is the same as the eennccrryypptt ssttaarrtt oouuttppuutt command.

        --oouuttppuutt
            This is the same as the eennccrryypptt ssttoopp oouuttppuutt command.
        ssttaarrtt [iinnppuutt|oouuttppuutt]
            Attempts to start encryption. If you omit iinnppuutt and oouuttppuutt, both
            input and output are enabled. To obtain a list of available types,
            use the eennccrryypptt eennaabbllee ?? command.

        ssttaattuuss
            Lists the current status of encryption.
        ssttoopp [iinnppuutt|oouuttppuutt]
            Stops encryption. If you omit input and output, encryption is on
            both input and output.
        ttyyppee type
            Sets the default type of encryption to be used with later eennccrryypptt
            ssttaarrtt or eennccrryypptt ssttoopp commands.
    eennvviirroonn arguments...
        The eennvviirroonn command is used to manipulate the variables that can be
        sent through the TELNET ENVIRON option. The initial set of variables
        is taken from the user's environment, with only the DISPLAY and
        PRINTER variables being exported by default. The USER variable is also
        exported if the --aa or --ll options are used.
        Valid arguments for the eennvviirroonn command are:

        ddeeffiinnee
            Define the variable variable to have a value of value. Any
            variables defined by this command are automatically exported. The
            value can be enclosed in single or double quotes so that tabs and
            spaces will be included.

        uunnddeeffiinnee
            Remove variable from the list of environment variables.

        eexxppoorrtt
            Mark the variable variable to be exported to the remote side.

        uunneexxppoorrtt
            Mark the variable variable so that it will not be exported unless
            explicitly asked for by the remote side.

        lliisstt
            List the current set of environment variables. Those marked with
            an asterisk (*) will be sent automatically; other variables will
            only be sent if explicitly requested.

        ??
            Prints out help information for the eennvviirroonn command.

    llooggoouutt
        Sends the TELNET LOGOUT option to the remote side. This command is
        similar to a cclloossee command; however, if the remote side does not
        support the LOGOUT option, nothing happens. If, however, the remote
        side does support the LOGOUT option, this command should cause the
        remote side to close the TELNET connection. If the remote side also
        supports suspending a user's session for later reattachment, the
        logout argument indicates that you should terminate the session
        immediately.
    mmooddee type
        Type is one of several options, depending on the state of the TELNET
        session. The remote host is asked for permission to go into the
        requested mode. If the remote host is capable of entering that mode,
        the requested mode will be entered.

        cchhaarraacctteerr
            Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does
            not understand the LINEMODE option, then enter character at a time
            mode.

        lliinnee
            Enable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does not
            understand the LINEMODE option, attempt to enter old line-by-line
            mode mode.

        iissiigg

        --iissiigg
            Attempt to enable (--iissiigg disables) the TRAPSIG mode of the
            LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be
            enabled.

        eeddiitt

        --eeddiitt
            Attempt to enable(--eeddiitt disables) the EDIT mode of the LINEMODE
            option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

        ssooffttttaabbss

        --ssooffttttaabbss
            Attempt to enable (--ssooffttttaabbss disables ) the SOFT_TAB mode of the
            LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be
            enabled.

        lliitteecchhoo

        --lliitteecchhoo
            Attempt to enable(--lliitteecchhoo disables) the LIT_ECHO mode of the
            LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be
            enabled.

        ??
            Prints out help information for the mmooddee command.
    ooppeenn host[[--ll] user][--port]
        Open a connection to the named host. If no port number is specified,
        tteellnneett(1) will attempt to contact a Telnet server at the default port.
        The host specification can be either a host name (see _hh_oo_ss_tt_ss(5)) or an
        Internet address specified in the dot notation (see _i_n_e_t(3)). The --
        ll option can be used to specify the user name to be passed to the
        remote system through the ENVIRON option. When connecting to a non-
        standard port, tteellnneett(1) omits any automatic initiation of TELNET
        options. When the port number is preceded by a minus sign, the initial
        option negotiation is done. After establishing a connection, the file
        ..tteellnneettrrcc in the user's home directory is opened. Lines beginning with
        a # are comment lines. Blank lines are ignored. Lines that begin
        without white space are the start of a computer entry. The first thing
        on the line is the name of the computer to which the connection is
        being made. The rest of the line, and successive lines that begin with
        white space, are assumed to be tteellnneett(1) commands and are processed as
        if they had been typed in manually to the tteellnneett(1) command prompt.

    qquuiitt
        Close any open Telnet session and exit tteellnneett(1). An end of file (in
        command mode) will also close a session and exit.

    sseenndd
        Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote host. The
        following are the arguments that can be specified (more than one
        argument can be specified at a time):

        aabboorrtt
            Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes) sequence.

        aaoo
            Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which should cause
            the remote system to flush all output from the remote system to
            the user's terminal.

        aayytt
            Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence, to which the remote
            system might or might not choose to respond.

        bbrrkk
            Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence, which can have significance
            to the remote system.

        eecc
            Sends the TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which should cause
            the remote system to erase the last character entered.

        eell
            Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line) sequence, which should cause the
            remote system to erase the line currently being entered.

        eeooff
            Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.

        eeoorr
            Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.

        eessccaappee
            Sends the current tteellnneett(1) escape character (initially ^).

        ggaa
            Sends the TELNET GA (Go Ahead) sequence, which likely has no
            significance to the remote system.

        ggeettssttaattuuss
            If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS command, ggeettssttaattuuss
            will send the subnegotiation to request that the server send its
            current option status.

        iipp
            Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence, which should
            cause the remote system to abort the currently running process.

        nnoopp
            Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.

        ssuusspp
            Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process) sequence.

        ssyynncchh
            Sends the TELNET SYNCH sequence. This sequence causes the remote
            system to discard all previously typed (but not yet read) input.
            This sequence is sent as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
            urgent data (and might not work if the remote system is a Berkeley
            Software Distribution (BSD) 4.2 system. If it does not work, a
            lowercase "r" might be echoed on the terminal).

        ddoo

        ddoonntt

        wwiillll

        wwoonntt
            Sends the TELNET DO cmd sequence. Cmd can be either a decimal
            number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic name for a specific TELNET
            command. Cmd can also be either hheellpp or ?? to print out help
            information, including a list of known symbolic names.

        ??
            Prints out help information for the sseenndd command.

    sseett

    uunnsseett
        The sseett command will set any one of a number of tteellnneett(1) variables to
        a specific value or to TRUE. The special value ooffff turns off the
        function associated with the variable, this is equivalent to using the
        uunnsseett command. The uunnsseett command will disable or set to FALSE any of
        the specified functions. The values of variables can be interrogated
        with the ddiissppllaayy command. The variables that can be set or unset, but
        not toggled, are listed here. In addition, any of the variables for
        the ttooggggllee command can be explicitly set or unset using the sseett and
        uunnsseett commands.

        aayytt
            If TELNET is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the
            status character is typed, a TELNET AYT sequence (see sseenndd aayytt
            preceding) is sent to the remote host. The initial value for the
            "Are You There" character is the terminal's status character.

        eecchhoo
            In line-by-line mode, this value toggles between several modes:
            local line-by-line mode, local echoing of entered characters (for
            normal processing), and echo suppression of entered characters
            (for entering, a password, for example, ). The initial value is
            ^E.

        eeooff
            If tteellnneett(1) is operating in LINEMODE or old line-by-line mode,
            entering this character as the first character on a line will
            cause this character to be sent to the remote system. The initial
            value of the eof character is taken to be the terminal's eeooff
            character.

        eerraassee
            If tteellnneett(1) is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss later in
            this topic), and if tteellnneett(1) is operating in character-at-a-time
            mode, when this character is typed, a TELNET EC sequence (see sseenndd
            eecc discussed previously in this topic) is sent to the remote
            system. The initial value for the erase character is taken to be
            the terminal's eerraassee character.

        eessccaappee
            This is the tteellnneett(1) escape character that causes entry into
            tteellnneett(1) command mode (when connected to a remote system). The
            initial value is ^[.

        fflluusshhoouuttppuutt
            If tteellnneett(1) is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss later in
            this topic) and the fflluusshhoouuttppuutt character is typed, a TELNET AO
            sequence (see sseenndd aaoo discussed previously in this topic) is sent
            to the remote host. The initial value for the flush character is
            taken to be the terminal's fflluusshh character.

        ffoorrww11

        ffoorrww22
            If is operating in LINEMODE, these are the characters that, when
            typed, cause partial lines to be forwarded to the remote system.
            The initial value for the forwarding characters are taken from the
            terminal's eol and eol2 characters.

        iinntteerrrruupptt
            If tteellnneett(1) is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss later in
            this topic) and the iinntteerrrruupptt character is typed, a TELNET IP
            sequence (see sseenndd iipp) is sent to the remote host. The initial
            value for the interrupt character is taken to be the terminal's
            iinnttrr character.

        kkiillll
            If tteellnneett(1) is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss), aanndd if
            tteellnneett(1) is operating in character at a time mode, when this
            character is typed, a TELNET EL sequence (see sseenndd eell discussed
            previously in this topic) is sent to the remote system. The
            initial value for the kill character is taken to be the terminal's
            kkiillll character.

        llnneexxtt
            If tteellnneett(1) is operating in LINEMODE or old line-by-line mode,
            this character is taken to be the terminal's llnneexxtt character. The
            initial value for the lnext character is taken to be the
            terminal's llnneexxtt character.

        qquuiitt
            If tteellnneett(1) is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode (see ttooggggllee llooccaallcchhaarrss) and the
            qquuiitt character is typed, a TELNET BRK sequence (see sseenndd bbrrkk) is
            sent to the remote host. The initial value for the quit character
            is taken to be the terminal's qquuiitt character.

        rreepprriinntt
            If tteellnneett(1) is operating in LINEMODE or old line-by-line mode,
            this character is taken to be the terminal's rreepprriinntt character.
            The initial value for the reprint character is taken to be the
            terminal's rreepprriinntt character.

        rrllooggiinn
            This is the rlogin escape character. If set, the normal escape
            character is ignored unless it is preceded by this character at
            the beginning of a line. This character, at the beginning of a
            line followed by a "" closes the connection; when followed by a
            ^Z it suspends the tteellnneett command. The initial state is to disable
            the rlogin escape character.

        ssttaarrtt
            If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, this
            character is taken to be the terminal's ssttaarrtt character. The
            initial value for the kill character is taken to be the terminal's
            ssttaarrtt character.

        ssttoopp
            If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, this
            character is taken to be the terminal's ssttoopp character. The
            initial value for the kill character is taken to be the terminal's
            ssttoopp character.

        ssuusspp
            If tteellnneett(1) is in llooccaallcchhaarrss mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and
            the ssuussppeenndd character is typed, a TELNET SUSP sequence (see sseenndd
            ssuusspp) is sent to the remote host. The initial value for the
            suspend character is taken to be the terminal's ssuussppeenndd character.

        ttrraacceeffiillee
            This is the file to which the output, caused by nneettddaattaa or ooppttiioonn
            tracing being TRUE, will be written. If it is set to '-', tracing
            information will be written to standard output (the default).

        wwoorrddeerraassee
            If tteellnneett(1) is operating in LINEMODE or old line-by-line mode,
            this character is taken to be the terminal's wwoorrddeerraassee character.
            The initial value for the worderase character is taken to be the
            terminal's wwoorrddeerraassee character.

        ??
            Displays the legal sseett (uunnsseett) commands.
    ssllcc state
        The ssllcc command (Set Local Characters) is used to set or change the
        state of the special characters when the TELNET LINEMODE option has
        been enabled. Special characters are characters that get mapped to
        TELNET commands sequences (like iipp or qquuiitt)) or line-editing characters
        (like eerraassee and kkiillll)).. By default, the local special characters are
        exported.

        cchheecckk
            Verify the current settings for the current special characters.
            The remote side is requested to send all the current special
            character settings; if there are any discrepancies with the local
            side, the local side will switch to the remote value.

        eexxppoorrtt
            Switch to the local defaults for the special characters. The local
            default characters are those of the local terminal at the time
            when tteellnneett(1) was started.

        iimmppoorrtt
            Switch to the remote defaults for the special characters. The
            remote default characters are those of the remote system at the
            time when the Telnet connection was established.

        ??
            Prints out help information for the ssllcc command.

    ssttaattuuss
        Show the current status of tteellnneett(1). This includes the peer one is
        connected to, as well as the current mode.
    ttooggggllee toggle

        Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that control how
        tteellnneett(1) responds to events. These flags can be set explicitly to
        TRUE or FALSE using the sseett and uunnsseett commands discussed previously in
        this topic. More than one argument can be specified. The state of
        these flags can be interrogated with the ddiissppllaayy command. Valid
        arguments are provided in the following list:

        aauutthhddeebbuugg
            Turn on debugging information for the authentication code.

        aauuttoofflluusshh
            If aauuttoofflluusshh and llooccaallcchhaarrss are both TRUE, when the aaoo, or qquuiitt
            characters are recognized (and transformed into TELNET sequences;
            see sseett for details), tteellnneett(1) refuses to display any data on the
            user's terminal until the remote system acknowledges (through a
            TELNET TIMING MARK option) that it has processed those TELNET
            sequences. The initial value for this toggle is TRUE if the
            terminal user has not done an stty noflsh; otherwise, the value is
            FALSE (see ssttttyy(1)).

        aauuttooddeeccrryypptt
            When the TELNET ENCRYPT option is negotiated, by default the
            actual encryption (decryption) of the data stream does not start
            automatically. The autoencrypt (autodecrypt) command states that
            encryption of the output (input) stream should be enabled as soon
            as possible.
            Because of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT option is not
            supported outside the United States and Canada.

        aauuttoollooggiinn
            If the remote side supports the TELNET AUTHENTICATION option,
            TELNET attempts to use it to perform automatic authentication. If
            the AUTHENTICATION option is not supported, the user's login name
            is propagated through the TELNET ENVIRON option. This command is
            the same as specifying a option on the ooppeenn command.

        aauuttoossyynncchh
            If aauuttoossyynncchh and llooccaallcchhaarrss are both TRUE, when either the iinnttrr or
            qquuiitt character is typed (see sseett for descriptions of the iinnttrr and
            qquuiitt characters), the resulting TELNET sequence sent is followed
            by the TELNET SYNCH sequence. This procedure sshhoouulldd cause the
            remote system to begin discarding all previously typed input until
            both of the TELNET sequences have been read and acted upon. The
            initial value of this toggle is FALSE.

        bbiinnaarryy
            Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on both input and
            output.

        iinnbbiinnaarryy
            Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on input.

        oouuttbbiinnaarryy
            Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on output.

        ccrrllff
            If this is TRUE, carriage returns will be sent as <CR><LF>. If
            this is FALSE, carriage returns will be sent as <CR><NUL>. The
            initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

        ccrrmmoodd
            Toggle carriage return mode. When this mode is enabled, most
            carriage return characters received from the remote host will be
            mapped into a carriage return followed by a line feed. This mode
            does not affect those characters typed by the user, it only
            affects those received from the remote host. This mode is not very
            useful unless the remote host only sends carriage return, but
            never line feed. The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

        ddeebbuugg
            Toggle socket-level debugging (useful only to the superuser). The
            initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

        eennccddeebbuugg
            Turn on debugging information for the encryption code.

        llooccaallcchhaarrss
            If this is TRUE, the fflluusshh, iinntteerrrruupptt, qquuiitt, eerraassee, and kkiillll
            characters (see sseett) are recognized locally, and should be
            transformed into appropriate TELNET control sequences
            (respectively aaoo, iipp, bbrrkk, eecc, and eell; see sseenndd discussed
            previously in this topic). The initial value for this toggle is
            TRUE in old line-by-line mode, and FALSE in character-at-a-time
            mode. When the lINEMODE option is enabled, the value of llooccaallcchhaarrss
            is ignored, and assumed to always be TRUE. If lINEMODE has ever
            been enabled, qquuiitt is sent as aabboorrtt, and eeooff and ssuussppeenndd are sent
            as eeooff and ssuusspp (see sseenndd).

        nneettddaattaa
            Toggle the display of all network data (in hexadecimal format).
            The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

        ooppttiioonnss
            Toggle the display of some internal tteellnneett(1) protocol processing
            (having to do with TELNET options). The initial value for this
            toggle is FALSE.

        pprreettttyydduummpp
            When the nneettddaattaa toggle is enabled, if pprreettttyydduummpp is enabled, the
            output from the nneettddaattaa command will be formatted in a more
            readable format. Spaces are put between each character in the
            output, and the beginning of any TELNET escape sequence is
            preceded by a '*' to make them easier to locate.

        sskkiipprrcc
            When the skiprc toggle is TRUE, TELNET skips the reading of the
            ..tteellnneettrrcc file in the user's home directory when connections are
            opened. The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

        tteerrmmddaattaa
            Toggle the display of all terminal data (in hexadecimal format).
            The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

        vveerrbboossee__eennccrryypptt
            When the vveerrbboossee__eennccrryypptt toggle is TRUE, TELNET prints out a
            message each time encryption is enabled or disabled. The initial
            value for this toggle is FALSE.
            Because of export controls, data encryption is not supported
            outside of the United States and Canada.

        ??
            Displays the legal ttooggggllee commands.

    zz
        Suspend tteellnneett(1). This command works only when the user is using
        ccsshh(1).
    !! [command]
        Execute a single command in a subshell on the local system. If command
        is omitted, an interactive subshell is invoked.
    ?? [command]
        Get help. With no arguments, tteellnneett(1) prints a help summary. If a
        command is specified, tteellnneett(1) will print the help information for
        that command only.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS

    The tteellnneett(1) command uses at least the HOME, SHELL, DISPLAY, and TERM
    environment variables. Other environment variables can be propagated to
    the other side through the TELNET ENVIRON option.

  FFIILLEESS

    ~~//..tteellnneettrrcc
        User customized tteellnneett startup values.

  NNOOTTEESS

    On some remote systems, echo must be turned off manually when in old line-
    by-line mode.

    In old line-by-line mode or LINEMODE, the terminal's eof character is only
    recognized (and sent to the remote system) when it is the first character
    on a line.
