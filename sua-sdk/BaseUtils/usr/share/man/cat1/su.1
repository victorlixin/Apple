    The ssuu(1) utility requests the password for login (or for login.root, if
    no login is provided), and switches to that user and group identifier (ID)
    after obtaining the information. It then executes the login shell of
    login. If the optional arguments are provided on the command line, they
    are passed to the shell.

    If ssuu(1) is executed by Administrator, no password is requested, and a
    shell with the appropriate user ID is executed.

    When you type su at the shell prompt, it is equivalent to typing su
    Administrator.

    By default, the environment is unmodified with the exception of USER,
    HOME, and SHELL. HOME and SHELL are set to the target login's default
    values. The invoked shell is the target login's. This is the traditional
    behavior of ssuu(1).

    The options are as follows:

    --ff
        If the invoked shell is ccsshh(1), this option prevents it from reading
        the ..ccsshhrrcc file.

    --ll
        Simulate a full login. The environment is discarded except for HOME,
        SHELL, PATH, TERM, and USER. HOME and SHELL are modified as above.
        USER is set to the target login. PATH is set to //bbiinn:://uussrr//bbiinn. TERM is
        imported from your current environment. The invoked shell is the
        target login's; ssuu(1) will change directory to the target login's home
        directory.

    --mm
        Leave the environment unmodified. The invoked shell is your login
        shell, and no directory changes are made.

    --pp
        Always ask for a password for login even when the invoking user is
        an Administrator. This will create a security token with network
        access.

    The --ll and --mm options are mutually exclusive; the last one specified
    overrides any previous ones.

    By default (unless the prompt is reset by a startup file) the superuser
    prompt is set to ## to distinguish it from the standard C shell or Korn
    shell prompt.

    Environment variables used by ssuu(1):

    HOME
        Default home directory of real user ID unless modified as specified
        above.

    PATH
        Default search path of real user ID unless modified as specified
        above.

    TERM
        Provides terminal type that can be retained for the substituted user
        ID.

    USER
        The user ID is always the effective ID (the target user ID) after
        ssuu(1) has been used to substitute a user identity.
