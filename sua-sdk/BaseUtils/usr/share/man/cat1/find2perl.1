    The ffiinndd22ppeerrll utility converts _ff_ii_nn_dd(1) command lines to equivalent Perl
    code. The resulting code is typically faster than running ffiinndd itself.

    The paths arguments specify where ffiinndd22ppeerrll starts its searches. The
    predicate arguments can be one of the following:
    !! predicate
        Negate the sense of the following predicate. The !! must be passed as a
        distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded by spaces and/or
        quoted from interpretation by the shell using a backslash (just as
        with using ffiinndd).
    (( predicate ... ))
        Group the given predicates. The parentheses must be passed as distinct
        arguments, so they may need to be surrounded by spaces or quoted from
        interpretation by the shell using a backslash (just as with using
        ffiinndd).
    predicate1 predicate2
        True if both predicate1 and predicate2 are true; predicate2 is not
        evaluated if predicate1 is false.
    predicate1 --oo predicate2
        True if either predicate1 or predicate2 is true; predicate2 is not
        evaluated if predicate1 is true.

    --ffoollllooww
        Follow (de-reference) symbolic links. The checking of file attributes
        depends on the position of the --ffoollllooww option. If it precedes the
        file-check option, _ss_tt_aa_tt(2) is used, which means the file check applies
        to the file to which the symbolic link is pointing. If the --ffoollllooww
        option follows the file-check option, this now applies to the symbolic
        link itself; that is, _ll_ss_tt_aa_tt(2) is done.

    --ddeepptthh
        Change directory traversal algorithm from breadth-first to depth-
        first.

    --pprruunnee
        Do not descend into the directory currently matched.

    --xxddeevv
        Do not traverse mount points (prunes search at mount-point
        directories).
    --nnaammee glob
        File-name matches specified glob wildcard pattern. The gglloobb argument
        may need to be quoted to avoid interpretation by the shell (just as
        with using ffiinndd).
    --ppeerrmm perm
        Low-order nine bits of permission match octal value perm.
    --ppeerrmm --perm
        The bits specified in perm are all set in files' permissions.
    --ttyyppe x
        The file's type matches the Perl --x operator.
    --ffssttyyppee type
        File system of current path is of type type (only NFS/non-NFS
        distinction is implemented).
    --uusseerr user
        True if user is owner of file.
    --ggrroouupp group
        True if file's group is group.

    --nnoouusseerr
        True if file's owner is not in password database.

    --nnooggrroouupp
        True if file's group is not in group database.
    --iinnuumm inum
        True file's inode number is inum.
    --lliinnkkss n
        True if (hard) link count of file matches n (see discussion later in
        this topic).
    --ssiizzee n
        True if file's size matches n (see discussion later in this topic).
        The n argument is normally counted in 512-byte blocks, but a suffix of
        cc specifies that size should be counted in characters (bytes); a
        suffix of kk specifies that size should be counted in 1024-byte blocks.
    --aattiimmee n
        True if last-access time of file matches n (measured in days) (see
        discussion later in this topic).
    --ccttiimmee n
        True if last-changed time of file's inode matches n (measured in days;
        see discussion later in this topic).
    --mmttiimmee n
        True if last-modified time of file matches n (measured in days; see
        discussion later in this topic).
    --nneewweerr file
        True if last-modified time of file matches file.

    --pprriinntt
        Print out path of file (always true).

    --pprriinntt00
        Like --pprriinntt, but terminates with \0 instead of \n.
    --eexxeecc options ;;
        Call _ee_xx_ee_cc(2) with the arguments in options to run in a subprocess; any
        occurences of {{}} in options will first be substituted with the path of
        the current file. Note that the command _rr_mm(1) has been special-cased
        to use the Perl uunnlliinnkk() function instead (as an optimization). The ;;
        must be passed as a distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded
        by spaces and/or quoted from interpretation by the shell using a
        backslash (just as with using ffiinndd).
    --ookk options ;;
        Like --eexxeecc, but first prompts user; if the user's response does not
        begin with a yy, do not execute options. The ;; must be passed as a
        distinct argument, so it may need to be surrounded by spaces and/or
        quoted from interpretation by the shell using a backslash (just as
        with using ffiinndd).
    --eevvaall expression
        Has the Perl script eevvaall() the expression.

    --llss
        Simulates --eexxeecc llss --ddiillss {{}} ;;
    --ttaarr file
        Adds current output to tar-format file.
    --ccppiioo file
        Adds current output to old-style copy in-out (cpio)-format file.
    --nnccppiioo file
        Adds current output to "new"-style cpio-format file.

    Predicates that take a numeric argument n can come in the following three
    forms:

    *     If n is prefixed with a plus (++): match values greater than n
    *     If n is prefixed with a minus (--): match values less than n
    *     If n is not prefixed with either a plus (++) or minus (--): match only
          values equal to n
