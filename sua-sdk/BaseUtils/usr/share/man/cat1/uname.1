    The uunnaammee(1) command writes the name of the operating system
    implementation to standard output. When options are specified, strings
    representing one or more system characteristics are written to standard
    output.

    The options are as follows:

    --aa
        Behave as though the options --mm, --nn, --pp, --rr, --ss, and --vv were
        specified. For example, uunnaammee --aa produces the output:
        Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications MyServer 3.5 SP-8.0.1967.1 x86 Pentium III/Celeron (rev0x0703)
        for a computer named MyServer, running Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, 
		version SP-8.0.1967, on a Pentium III/Celeron platform.

    --HH
        Write host operating system information. For example, uunnaammee --aaHH
        produces the output:
        Windows james 5.0 SP0 x86 Intel_x86_Family6_Model7_Stepping2
        for a computer named james, running Windows 2000 release 5.0, version
        SP0, on a Pentium III platform.

    --mm
        Write a generic simple computer-type name. In this version, only xx8866
        is supported. For a description of the exact processor, use --pp.

    --nn
        Write the name of the system to standard output.

    --pp
        Write the type of the current hardware platform to standard output.

    --rr
        Write the current release level of Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications 
		to standard output. For example, on a computer running 
		Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications release 3.5, this is "3.5". When 
		specified with the --HH option, write the current release of the 
		host operating system. For example, on a computer running Windows 2000 
		(release 5.0), this is "5.0".

    --ss
        Write the name of the operating system implementation to standard
        output. In Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, this is 
		"Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications". When specified with the --HH 
		option, write the name of the host operating system. On a
        Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications system, this is "Windows".

    --UU
        Print information based on the UNIX operating environment.

    --vv
        Write the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications build number. If the
		--HH option is specified, write the service-pack level of the host
		operating system to standard output. This is the service pack number
		applied to the Windows operating system. If no service pack has been 
		applied, it is SP0.

    --xx
        Print command usage.

    --XX
        Print expanded system information.

    If the --aa flag is specified, or multiple flags are specified, all output
    is written on a single line, separated by spaces.
