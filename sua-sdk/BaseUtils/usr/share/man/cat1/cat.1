    The ccaatt(1) utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
    output. The file operands are processed in command-line order. A single
    dash represents the standard input.

    The options are as follows:

    --AA, ----sshhooww--aallll
        Implies options --vv, --ee and --tt at the same time.

    --bb, ----nnuummbbeerr--nnoonnbbllaannkk
        Like --nn but does not number blank lines.

    --EE, ----sshhooww--eennddss
        Prints a dollar sign (`$') at the end of each line.

    --ee
        Like --vv and displays a dollar sign ($) at the end of each line.

    --nn, ----nnuummbbeerr
        Number the output lines beginning at 1.

    --OO _o_f_f_s_e_t
        Perform an absolute seek of _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes into the output file
        before starting to write. Note that if _s_t_d_o_u_t is the file this
        will have no meaning. This option applies best to disk based
        files.

    --oo _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
        Open the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e as the output file. The file will be
        opened for writing (not truncated) and positioned by default at
        the end of the file.

    --SS
        Do not display any warning messages about files. This option is the
        same as the old --ss.  It has been changed to --SS so that the origi-
        nal meaning(s) for --ss matches other systems improving portability.

    --ss, ----ssqquueeeezzee--bbllaannkkss
        Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
        single spaced.

    --TT, ----sshhooww--ttaabbss
        Prints tab characters as `^I'.

    --tt
        Like --vv and also displays tab characters as ^I.

    --uu
        The --uu option ensures that the output is unbuffered.

    --vv
        Displays non-printing characters so they are visible. Control
        characters print as ^X for control-X; the delete character (octal
        0177) prints as ^?. Non-ASCII characters (with the high bit set) are
        printed as M- (for meta) followed by the character defined by the
        lower seven bits.

    Because of the shell language mechanism that is used to perform output
    redirection, the following command will cause the original data in file1
    to be destroyed unless the shell is set for noclobber.

    cat file1 file 2 > file1

    The ccaatt(1) utility exits with 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
