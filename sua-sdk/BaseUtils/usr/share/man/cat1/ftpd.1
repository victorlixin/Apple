    The ffttppdd(1) utility is the internet file transfer protocol (ftp) server
    process. The server uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port
    specified in the ftp service specification.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    --aa n
        Set a time-out for the active command. This time-out is for the
        transfer of data for all commands (the --tt option sets a time-out only
        for idle connections). This option is useful for environments where
        connections from the ftp client is unreliable and will not or cannot
        be reestablished once lost. The value of n seconds is the time-out;
        the default active time-out is 0 seconds, which preserves the
        traditional behavior. The minimum value for n is 600 (ten minutes); a
        negative value is not allowed.

    --dd
        Debugging information is written to the syslog using LOG_FTP.

    --ll
        Each successful and failed ffttpp(1) session is logged using syslog with
        a facility of LOG_FTP. If this option is specified twice, the retrieve
        (get), store (put), append, delete, make directory, remove directory
        and rename operations and their file-name arguments are also logged.

    --TT
        A client can also request a different time-out period; the maximum
        period allowed can be set to timeout seconds with the --TT option. The
        default limit is two hours.

    --tt
        The inactivity time-out period is set to timeoutseconds (the default
        is 15 minutes).

    You can use the file //eettcc//nnoollooggiinn to disable ftp access. If the file
    exists, ffttppdd(1) displays it and exits. If the file //eettcc//ffttppwweellccoommee exists,
    ffttppdd(1) prints it before issuing the ready message. If the file //eettcc//mmoottdd
    exists, ffttppdd(1) prints it after you have successfully logged on.

    The ftp server currently supports the following ftp requests. The case of
    the requests is ignored.

    The remaining ftp requests specified in Internet RFC 959 are recognized,
    but not implemented. MDTM and SIZE are not specified in RFC 959, but will
    appear in the next updated FTP RFC.

    The ftp server will abort an active file transfer only when the ABOR
    command is preceded by a telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a
    telnet "Synch" signal in the command telnet stream, as described in
    Internet RFC 959. If a STAT command is received during a data transfer,
    preceded by a telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.

    The ffttppdd(1) utility interprets file names according to the globbing
    conventions used by ccsshh(1). This allows users to utilize the
    metacharacters **??[[]]{{}}~~.

    The ffttppdd(1) utility authenticates users according to these rules:

   1.     The logon name must be in the password data base, and not have a
          null password. In this case a password must be provided by the
          client before any file operations can be performed.
   2.     The logon name must not appear in the file //eettcc//ffttppuusseerrss.

  AANNOONNYYMMOOUUSS FFTTPP

    On many systems (but not Interix), there is a provision for "anonymous
    ftp"--if the logon names "anonymous" or "ftp" match an account on the
    system, the user can log on with any password. On these systems, ffttppdd(1)
    performs a _cc_hh_rr_oo_oo_tt(2) system call and takes other measures to preserve
    security.

    On Interix versions before 2.5, there is nnoo anonymous ftp-- the user
    names "anonymous" and "ftp" have no special meaning. Because Interix
    provides no _cc_hh_rr_oo_oo_tt(3) system call, anonymous ftp sessions are insecure and
    dangerous.

  FFIILLEESS

    The ffttppdd(1) utility makes use of the following files:

    //eettcc//ffttppuusseerrss

    //eettcc//ffttppwweellccoommee

    The possible security holes have been extensively scrutinized, but are
