    The bbaannnneerr(1) utility prints a large, high-quality banner on the standard
    output. If the message is omitted, it prompts for and reads one line of
    its standard input. If --ww is given, the output is reduced from a width of
    132 to n, suitable for a narrow terminal. If n is omitted, it defaults to
    80.

    The output should be printed on a hard-copy device, up to 132 columns
    wide, with no breaks between the pages. The volume is great enough that
    you might want a printer or a fast hard-copy terminal. You can also use a
    decwriter or other 300-baud terminal, but the process on these will be
    slow.

  BBUUGGSS

    Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably:
    <, >, [, ], \, ^, _, {, }, |, and ~. The characters ", ', and & have an
    odd appearance, but this can be useful.

    The --ww option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns. The
    smaller it gets, the grainier the output. Sometimes it runs letters
    together.
