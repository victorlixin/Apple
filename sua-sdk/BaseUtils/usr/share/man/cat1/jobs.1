    This command is a built-in command in the C shell and the Korn shell.

  CC sshheellll

    The jjoobbss(1) command lists the active jobs. With --ll, it lists process
    identifiers (IDs) in addition to the normal information. On TCF systems,
    prints the site on which each job is executing.

  KKoorrnn sshheellll

    The jjoobbss(1) command displays information about the specified jobs; if no
    jobs are specified, all jobs are displayed. The --nn option causes
    information to be displayed only for jobs that have changed state since
    the last notification. If the --ll option is used, the process identifier
    (PID) of each process in a job is also listed. The --pp option causes only
    the process group of each job to be printed. See "Job Control" in _kk_ss_hh(1)
    for the format of job and the displayed job.
