    The ccaatt3322(1) utility is a Win32 program that copies its standard input to
    standard output. It has no other options. It is sometimes used when
    constructing command pipelines from both SUA and Win32 commands.

    The SUA subsystem has some limitations running Win32 programs and
    connecting their output to SUA pipes. Any access to a particular pipe
    end by an SUA process after a Win32 process has been given that end
    (through the _ee_xx_ee_cc(2) call) will fail, either with the [EPIPE] error, a
    SIGPIPE signal, or EOF.

    For example, this command will show only the contents of file1:

    (cmd.exe /c type file1; cat file2) | cat

    The SUA ccaatt(1) command fails, because when it tries to write to the
    pipe (after the Win32 command), it gets an EPIPE error.

    This command will work, because a Win32 command can accept the pipe from
    an SUA command:

    (cat file1 ; cmd.exe /c type file2) | cat

    The subshell created by the parentheses fork/execs the SUA ccaatt(1)
    command first; it is only after it fork/execs the Win32 command that the
    write end of the pipe becomes inaccessible to SUA processes.

    The ccaatt3322(1) utility is a Win32 filter that can overcome many of these
    problems. The fix for the first command is to use ccaatt3322(1):

    (cmd.exe /c type file1; cat file2 | cat32) | cat

    In this case, the SUA cat is writing to a fresh, uncontaminated pipe.

    The ccaatt3322(1) utility exits with status 0 for success, and >0 if an error
