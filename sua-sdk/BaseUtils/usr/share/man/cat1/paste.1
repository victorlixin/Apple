    The ppaassttee(1) utility concatenates the corresponding lines of the given
    input files, replacing all but the last file's newline characters with a
    single tab character, and writes the resulting lines to standard output.
    If end-of-file is reached on an input file while other input files still
    contain data, the file is treated as if it were an endless source of empty
    lines.

    The options are as follows:

    --dd list
        Use one or more of the characters provided to replace the newline
        characters instead of the default tab. The characters in list are used
        circularly. That is, when list is exhausted, the first character from
        list is reused. This continues until a line from the last input file
        (in default operation) or the last line in each file (using the --
        ss option) is displayed. Then ppaassttee(1) begins selecting characters from
        the beginning of list again.
        The following special characters can also be used in list:

        \\nn
            Newline character

        \\tt
            Tab character

        \\\\
            Backslash character

        \\00
            Empty string (not a null character)
        Any other character preceded by a backslash (\\) is equivalent to the
        character itself.

    --ss
        Concatenate all of the lines of each separate input file in command-
        line order. The newline character of every line except the last line
        in each input file is replaced with the tab character, unless
        otherwise specified by the --dd option.

    If a hyphen (--) is specified for one or more of the input files, the
    standard input is used; standard input is read one line at a time,
    circularly, for each instance of --
