  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The rrllooggiinn(1) utility starts a terminal session on a remote host host. The
    host name can be specified in either name or numeric dot notation.

    The rrllooggiinn(1) utility first attempts to use the Kerberos authorization
    mechanism, described later in this topic. If the remote host does not
    support Kerberos, the standard Berkeley ..rrhhoossttss authorization mechanism is
    used. The options are as follows:

    --88
        The --88 option allows an eight-bit input data path at all times;
        otherwise, parity bits are stripped except when the remote side's stop
        and start characters are other than ^^SS//^^QQ.

    --DD
        The --DD option prefixes both the remote and local user names with the
        user's Windows domain name. (By default, both remote and local user
        names are the user name without the domain.) The argument to the --
        ll option will always override the remote user name value. This option
        should only be used when connecting with another Interix system.

    --dd
        The --dd option turns on socket debugging (see _ss_ee_tt_ss_oo_cc_kk_oo_pp_tt(2)) on the
        transmission control protocol (TCP) sockets used for communication
        with the remote host.

    --EE
        The --EE option stops any character from being recognized as an escape
        character. When used with the --88 option, this provides a completely
        transparent connection.

    --ee
        The --ee option allows user specification of the escape character, which
        is ~~ by default. This specification can be as a literal character, or
        as an octal value in the form \\nnnnnn.

    --KK
        The --KK option turns off all Kerberos authentication.

    --LL
        The --LL option allows the rrllooggiinn session to be run in "litout" (see
        ttttyy(1)) mode.

    --ll
        The --ll option specifies a different username for the remote login. If
        this option is not specified, your local user name will be used.

    A line of the form escape_char.. (that is, the escape character followed by
    a period) disconnects from the remote host. Similarly, the line
    escape_char followed by CTRL+Z (^Z) suspends the rrllooggiinn(1) session, and
    escape_char followed by delayed-suspend_char suspends the send portion of
    the rrllooggiinn, but allows output from the remote system. By default, the
    tilde (~~) character is the escape character, and CTRL+Y (^Y) is usually
    the delayed-suspend character.

    All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
    the rrllooggiinn(1) is transparent. Flow control through ^S/^Q and flushing of
    input and output on interrupts are handled properly.

    On traditional systems, a user can rrllooggiinn(1) to a system identified in the
    user's ..rrhhoossttss file without providing a password. This is because on a
    traditional system, the rrllooggiinndd(1) program is run as the superuser, and
    can take any login identity. This might or might not work on an Interix
    system, because of differences in the user authentication mechanism:

    *     If the daemon is running as the user SYSTEM, this will work.
    *     If the daemon is not running as SYSTEM, the password of the account
          used to run the daemon must be stored using the rreeggppwwdd(1) utility.
    *     If the _ii_rr_uu_ss_ee_rr_oo_kk(3) function indicates that the address might have
          been spoofed, the user will be prompted for a password, regardless
          of the user identifier (ID) of the daemon.
          (The test is done by converting the host number to a host name and then
          converting the host name to a host number; if the two host numbers do not
          match, the address might have been spoofed. A user can get similar results
          by using nnssllooookkuupp(1) to check both the host name and the host number.)

  NNOOTTEESS

    If the name of the binary is a host name (that is, if there is a hard link
    to rrllooggiinn(1) that is the name of a known host), rrllooggiinn(1) automatically
    opens a connection to the host.

  FFIILLEESS

    The rrccpp(1) and rrsshhdd(1) programs make use of the following files, if they
    exist:

    //eettcc//hhoossttss..eeqquuiivv
        On the target system, this file contains the names of systems and
        users allowed to login. See rrllooggiinndd(1) for more information.

    $$HHOOMMEE//..rrhhoossttss
        On the target system, this file can contain the names of systems (and
        user names) allowed to login. See rrllooggiinndd(1) for more information.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    The following environment variable is utilized by rrllooggiinn::(1)

    TERM
        Determines the user's terminal type.
