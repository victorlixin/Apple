    The ssoorrtt(1) utility sorts text files by lines. Comparisons are based on
    one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input, and are performed
    lexicographically. By default, if keys are not given, ssoorrtt(1) regards each
    input line as a single field.

    The following options are available:

    --cc
        Check that the single input file is sorted. If the file is not sorted,
        ssoorrtt(1) produces the appropriate error messages and exits with code 1;
        otherwise, ssoorrtt(1) returns 0; ssoorrtt(1) --cc produces no output.

    --mm
        Merge only; the input files are assumed to be pre-sorted.

    --oo output
        The argument given is the name of an output file to be used instead of
        the standard output. This file can be the same as one of the input
        files.

    --TT _d_i_r
        Use _d_i_r as the directory for temporary files.  The default is the
        contents of the environment variable TMPDIR or _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p if TMPDIR
        does not exist.

    --uu
        Unique: suppress all but one in each set of lines having equal keys.
        If used with the --cc option, check that there are no lines with
        duplicate keys.

    The following options override the default ordering rules. When ordering
    options appear independent of key field specifications, the requested
    field ordering rules are applied globally to all sort keys. When attached
    to a specific key (see --kk), the ordering options override all global
    ordering options for that key.

    --dd
        Only blank-space and alphanumeric characters are used in making
        comparisons.

    --ff
        Considers all lowercase characters that have uppercase equivalents to
        be the same for purposes of comparison.

    --ii
        Ignore all non-printable characters.

    --nn
        An initial numeric string, consisting of optional blank space,
        optional minus sign, and zero or more digits (including decimal point)
        is sorted by arithmetic value.(The --nn option no longer implies the --
        bb option.)

    --rr
        Reverse the sense of comparisons.

    --HH
        Use a merge sort instead of a radix sort.  This option should be
        used for files larger than 60Mb.

    The treatment of field separators can be altered using the following
    options:

    --bb
        Ignores leading blank space when determining the start and end of a
        restricted sort key. A --bb option specified before the first --kk option
        applies globally to all --kk options. Otherwise, the --bb option can be
        attached independently to each field argument of the --kk option
        (discussed later in this topic). The --bb option has no effect unless
        key fields are specified.
    --tt char
        In this case, char is used as the field separator character. The
        initial char is not considered to be part of a field when determining
        key offsets. Each occurrence of char is significant (for example,
        charchar delimits an empty field). If --tt is not specified, blank-space
        characters are used as default field separators, and any number of
        continuous blanks count as a single field separator.
    --RT char
        In this case, char is used as the record-separator character. The
        default record separator is newline (one line is one record). This
        should be used with discretion; --TT<alphanumeric> usually produces
        undesirable results.
    --kk field1[,,field2]
        Designates the starting position, field1, and optional ending
        position, field2, of a key field. Counting starts at 1. The --kk option
        replaces the obsolescent options ++pos1 and --pos2.
        You can specify more than one sorting field by specifying multiple --
        kk options. The second field specified is only used to sort records
        where the first fields specified are identical, and so on.

    The following operands are available:

    File
        The path name of a file to be sorted, merged, or checked. If no file
        operands are specified, or if a file operand is -- the standard input
        is used.

    Field
        A field is defined as a minimal sequence of characters followed by a
        field separator or a newline character. By default, the first blank
        space of a sequence of blank spaces acts as the field separator. All
        blank spaces in a sequence of blank spaces are considered as part of
        the next field; for example, all blank spaces at the beginning of a
        line are considered to be part of the first field.
        Fields are specified by the --kkfield1[,field2] argument. A missing
        field2 argument defaults to the end of a line.
        The arguments field1 and field2 have the form m.n followed by one or
        more of the options bb,dd,ff,ii, nn,rr. A field1 position specified by m.n
        (m,n>0) is interpreted as the nth character in the mth field. A
        missing .n in field1 means .1, indicating the first character of the
        mth field; If the --bb option is in effect, n is counted from the first
        non-blank character in the mth field; m.1b refers to the first non-
        blank character in the mth field.
        A field2 position specified by m.n is interpreted as the nth character
        (including separators) of the mth field. A missing .n indicates the
        last character of the mth field; m = 0 designates the end of a line.
        Thus the option --kkv.x,w.y is synonymous with the obsolescent option
        +v-1.x-1 w-1.y ; when y is omitted, --kkv.x,w is synonymous with ++v--11..x--
        11ww++11..00. The obsolescent ++pos1 --pos2 option is still supported, except
        for ww..00bb which has no --kk equivalent.

  FFIILLEESS

    The ssoorrtt(1) utility makes use of the following files:
    //ttmmpp//ssoorrtt..*
        Default temporary directory, used if TMPDIR is not set.

    outputPID
        Temporary name for output if output already exists.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
    TMPDIR
        Path in which to store temporary files.  Note that TMPDIR may
        be overridden by the --TT option.

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    The ssoorrtt(1) utility exits with one of the following values:

    0
        Normal behavior.

    1
        On disorder (or non-uniqueness) with the --cc option

    2
        An error occurred.

  NNOOTTEESS

    The current ssoorrtt(1) command uses lexicographic radix sorting, which
    requires that sort keys be kept in memory (as opposed to previous versions
    which used quick and merge sorts and did not). Performance therefore
    depends highly on the efficient choice of sort keys, and the --bb option and
    the field2 argument of the --kk option should be used whenever possible.
    Similarly, ssoorrtt(1) --kk11ff is equivalent to ssoorrtt(1) --ff and might take twice
    as long.
