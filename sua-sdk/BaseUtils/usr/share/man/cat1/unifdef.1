    The uunniiffddeeff(1) command is useful for removing ifdefed lines from a file,
    otherwise leaving the file alone.

    The uunniiffddeeff(1) command acts on #ifdef,#ifndef, #else, and #endif lines; it
    knows only enough about C to discern when one of these is inactive because
    it is inside a comment, or a single or double quote. Its process of
    parsing for quotes is very simple: when it finds an open quote, it ignores
    everything (except escaped quotes) until it finds a close quote; it will
    not complain if it gets to the end of a line and finds no backslash for
    continuation.

    This version of uunniiffddeeff(1) has been extended to strip out specified tagged
    comments. See the --CC option for more details

    Available options:

    --cc
        If the --cc flag is specified, the operation of uunniiffddeeff(1) is
        complemented; that is, the lines that would have been removed or
        blanked are retained and vice versa.
    --CCstring
        Strip out comments beginning with //** or //// and immediately followed by
        string. For example, the command-line option --CC@@hhoommee will cause all
        comments beginning with //**@@hhoommee or ////@@hhoommee to be stripped, including
        (for //**) multiline comments.
    --DDsym
    --UUsym
        Specify which symbols to define or undefine. The lines inside those
        ifdefs will be copied to the output or removed as appropriate. The
        ifdef, ifndef, else, and endif lines associated with sym will also be
        removed. Ifdefs involving symbols you do not specify and "#if" control
        lines are untouched and copied out along with their associated ifdef,
        else, and endif lines. If an ifdef X occurs nested inside another
        ifdef X, the inside ifdef is treated as if it were an unrecognized
        symbol. If the same symbol appears in more than one argument, the last
        occurrence dominates.
    --iiDDsym
    --iiUUsym
        Ignore the ifdefs associated with sym. If your C code uses ifdefs to
        delimit non-C lines, such as comments or code that is under
        construction, you must tell uunniiffddeeff(1) which symbols are used for that
        purpose so that it will not try to parse for quotes and comments
        inside those ifdefs. Specify ignored ifdefs with --iiDD sym and --iiUU sym,
        similar to --DD sym and --UU sym above.

    --ll
        Replace removed lines with blank lines instead of deleting them.

    --tt
        Disables parsing for C comments and quotes, which is useful for plain
        text.

    The uunniiffddeeff(1) command copies its output to stdout and will take its input
    from stdin if no file argument is given.

    The uunniiffddeeff(1) command works nicely with the --DD sym option added to
    ddiiffff(1) as of the 4.1 Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    Inappropriate else or endif.

    Premature EOF with line numbers of the unterminated #ifdefs.

    Exit status is 0 if output is exact copy of input, 1 if not, 2 if trouble.

  BBUUGGSS

    Should try to deal with "#if" lines.

    Does not work correctly if input contains null characters.
