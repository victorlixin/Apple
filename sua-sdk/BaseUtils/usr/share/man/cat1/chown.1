    The cchhoowwnn(1) command sets the user identifier (ID) and/or the group ID of
    the specified files. If file is a symbolic link, the user ID and/or the
    group ID of the file referenced by the symbolic link is changed unless the
    --hh option is used.

    --ff
        Suppress error messages on files where the ownership could not be
        changed

    --HH
        If the --RR option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
        are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
        are not followed.)

    --hh
        If file is a symbolic link, change the user ID and/or the group ID of
        the symbolic link.

    --LL
        If the --RR option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

    --PP
        If the --RR option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.

    --RR
        Change the user ID and/or the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted
        in the files instead of just the files themselves.

    The --HH, --LL, and --PP options are ignored unless the --RR option is specified.
    In addition, these options override each other and the command's actions
    are determined by the last one specified.

    The owner and group operands are both optional; however, one must be
    specified. If the group operand is specified, it must be preceded by a
    colon (::).

    The owner can be specified by either a numeric user ID or a user name. If
    a user name is also a numeric user ID, the operand is used as a user name.
    The group can be either a numeric group ID or a group name. If a group
    name is also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a group name.

    For security reasons, the ownership of a file can be altered only by a
    process with appropriate privileges.
