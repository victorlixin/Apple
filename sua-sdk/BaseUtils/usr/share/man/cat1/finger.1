    The ffiinnggeerr(1) utility displays information about the system users.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --dd
        When used in conjunction with the --ss option or with no user specified,
        print the user name as a fully qualified domain name in the Windows
        domain+name format. When this option is used, the IIddllee field is not
        shown.

    --hh
        Display the name of the remote host instead of the office location and
        office phone.

    --ll
        Print long format, displaying all of the information described for the
        --ss option as well as the user's home directory, home phone number,
        login shell, mail status, and the contents of the files ..ppllaann and
        ..pprroojjeecctt from the user's home directory.
        If idle time is at least a minute and less than a day, it is presented
        in the form hh:mm. Idle times greater than a day are presented as d
        day[s]hh:mm.
        Phone numbers specified as eleven digits are printed as +N-NNN-NNN-
        NNNN. Numbers specified as ten or seven digits are printed as the
        appropriate subset of that string. Numbers specified as five digits
        are printed as xN-NNNN. Numbers specified as four digits are printed
        as xNNNN.
        If write permission is denied to the device, the phrase (messages off)
        is appended to the line containing the device name. One entry per user
        is displayed with the --ll option; if a user is logged on multiple
        times, terminal information is repeated once per login.
        Mail status is shown as No Mail. if there is no mail at all, Mail last
        read DDD MMM ## HH:MM YYYY (TZ) if the person has looked at his or her
        mailbox since new mail arrived, or New mail received ..., Unread since
        ... if they have new mail.

    --oo
        The office location and office phone information is displayed instead
        of the name of the remote host.

    --ss
        The ffiinnggeerr(1) utility displays the user's login name, real name,
        terminal name, and write status (as a * before the terminal name if
        write permission is denied), idle time, login time, and either office
        location and office phone number, or the remote host. If --hh is given,
        the remote host is printed. If --oo is given, the office location and
        phone number are printed instead (the default).
        Idle time is in minutes if it is a single integer, hours and minutes
        if a colon (::) is present, or days if a dd is present. Login time is
        displayed as the day name if fewer than six days. It is displayed as
        month, day, hours, and minutes, unless more than six months ago, in
        which case the year is displayed rather than the hours and minutes.
        Idle time is not shown if the --dd option is given.
        Unknown devices and nonexistent idle and login times are displayed as
        single asterisks.

    --pp
        Prevents the --ll option of ffiinnggeerr(1) from displaying the contents of
        the ..ppllaann and ..pprroojjeecctt files.

    If no options are specified, ffiinnggeerr(1) defaults to the --ll style output if
    operands are provided, otherwise to the --ss style. Some fields may be
    missing, in either format, if information is not available for them.

    If no arguments are specified, ffiinnggeerr(1) will print an entry for each user
    currently logged into the system.

    You can use ffiinnggeerr(1) to look up users on a remote computer. The format to
    use is to specify a user as user@@host, or @@host, where the default output
    format for the former is the --ll style, and the default output format for
    the latter is the --ss style. The --ll option is the only option that can be
    passed to a remote computer.

    If the finger daemon on the host computer was started in secure mode (by
    using the --ss option), you must provide the user name you want to look up.

  FFIILLEESS

    If present, ffiinnggeerr(1) makes use of the following files:

    ..ppllaann
        The ffiinnggeerr(1) utility displays the contents of this file in the home
        directory of the targeted user.

    ..pprroojjeecctt
        The ffiinnggeerr(1) utility displays the contents of this file in the home
        directory of the targeted user.
