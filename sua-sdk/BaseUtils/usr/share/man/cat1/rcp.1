  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The rrccpp(1) utility copies files between computers. Each file or directory
    argument is either a remote file name of the form rrnnaammee@rrhhoosstt:ppaatthh or a
    local file name (containing no ':' characters, or a '/' before any ':'s).
    The rhost name can be specified in either name or numeric dot-notation.

    --ff
        Force rrccpp(1) into source mode. This option overrides --tt.

    --pp
        The --pp option causes rrccpp(1) to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its
        copies the modification times, access times, and modes of the source
        files, ignoring the umask. By default, the mode and owner of file2 are
        preserved if it already existed; otherwise, the mode of the source
        file modified by the by the umask on the destination host is used. For
        information on the umask, see _uu_mm_aa_ss_kk(2).

    --rr
        If any of the source files are directories, rrccpp(1) copies each subtree
        rooted at that name; in this case the destination must be a directory.

    --tt
        Force rrccpp(1) into sink (or receive) mode. If both --ff and --tt are given,
        --ff takes precedence.

    If path is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to the login
    directory of the specified user ruser on rhost, or your current user name
    if no other remote user name is specified. A path on a remote host can be
    quoted (using \\, "", or '') so that the metacharacters are interpreted
    remotely.

    The rrccpp(1) utility does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote
    execution through rrsshh(1), and requires the same authorization.

    The rrccpp(1) utility handles third-party copies, where neither source nor
    target files are on the current computer.

  NNOOTTEESS

    Does not detect all cases where the target of a copy might be a file when
    only a directory should be legal.

    Is confused by any output generated by commands in a ..llooggiinn, ..pprrooffiillee, or
    ..ccsshhrrcc file on the remote host.

    The destination user and host name might have to be specified as
    "rhost.rname" when the destination computer is running the Berkeley
    Software Distribution (BSD) 4.2 version of rrccpp(1).

  FFIILLEESS

    The rrccpp(1) command uses the following files, if they exist:

    $$HHOOMMEE//..rrhhoossttss
        This file is on the destination computer; see rrsshhdd(1) for a
        description.
