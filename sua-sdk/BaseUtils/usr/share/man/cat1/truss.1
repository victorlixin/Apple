    The ttrruussss(1) utility traces system calls and signals while it runs. Unless
    the --oo option is given, these are written to standard error. You must
    specify one or more args. Normally, the arg is the argument vector of a
    command to trace. If the --pp option is given, you can supply a list of
    process identifiers (IDs) as the args.

    The ttrruussss(1) takes the following options:

    --DD
        Generate debug.

    --hh
        Display help information.
    --oo file
        Write output into file; without this option, output is written to
        standard error.

    --pp
        Print information only about certain processes; processes are
        specified as process IDs.

    --RR
        Dump registers on each event.
    --SS n
        Single step for n computer instructions.

    The ttrruussss(1) utility exits with status 0 for success, and >0 if an error
    occurred.

    To follow the system calls for an llss(1) command:

    $ truss ls /bin/truss
    tracing pid 8323077
    isatty(2) isatty returned 0
    ioctl() ioctl returned 0
    getids() getids returned 0
    stat() stat returned 0
    fstat(1, 0x2540588) fstat returned 0
    isatty(2) isatty returned 0
    isatty(2) isatty returned 0
    write(1, 0x830C60, 22) /bin/truss
    write returned 22 0x16
    exit(0) process has exited

    In this case, all calls returned 0.
