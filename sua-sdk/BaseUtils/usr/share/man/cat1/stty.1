    stty [[-a || -e || -g]] [[-f file]] [[operands]]

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The ssttttyy(1) utility sets or reports on terminal characteristics for the
    device that is its standard input. If no options or operands are
    specified, it reports the settings of a subset of characteristics and
    additional ones if they differ from their default values. Otherwise, it
    modifies the terminal state according to the specified arguments (if it is
    able). Some combinations of arguments are mutually exclusive on some
    terminal types. Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications uses a terminal 
    type of iinntteerriixx to describe the console.

    The following options are available:

    --aa
        Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output.

    --ee
        Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output
        in the traditional Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) "all" and
        "everything" formats.

    --ff
        Open and use the terminal named by file rather than using standard
        input. The file is opened using the O_NONBLOCK flag of _oo_pp_ee_nn(2), making
        it possible to set or display settings on a terminal that might
        otherwise block on the open.

    --gg
        Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard output
        in a form that can be used as an argument to a subsequent invocation
        of ssttttyy(1) to restore the current terminal state.

    The following arguments are available to set the terminal characteristics:

    CCoonnttrrooll mmooddeess
        These flags affect hardware characteristics associated with the
        terminal

    IInnppuutt mmooddeess
        These flags affect the characters recognized on input.

    OOuuttppuutt mmooddeess

    CCoonnttrrooll cchhaarraacctteerrss
        These flags define the control characters recognized by the terminal.

    CCoommbbiinnaattiioonn mmooddeess
        These flags represent useful combinations of other flags.

    CCoommppaattiibbiilliittyy mmooddeess
        These flags exist for compatibility with older versions of ssttttyy(1).

  CCoonnttrrooll mmooddeess

    Control mode flags affect hardware characteristics associated with the
    terminal. This corresponds to the c_cflag in the tteerrmmiiooss structure.
    ppaarreennbb (--ppaarreennbb)

        Select character size, if possible.

    number
        Set terminal baud rate to the number given, if possible. If the baud
        rate is set to zero, modem control is no longer asserted.
    iissppeeeedd number
        Set terminal input baud rate to the number given, if possible. If the
        input baud rate is set to zero, the input baud rate is set to the
        value of the output baud rate.
    oossppeeeedd number
        Set terminal output baud rate to the number given, if possible. If the
        output baud rate is set to zero, modem control is no longer asserted.
    ssppeeeedd number
        This sets both iissppeeeedd and oossppeeeedd to number.
    hhuuppccll (--hhuuppccll)

        Strip (do not strip) input characters to seven bits.
    iinnllccrr (--iinnllccrr)
        Map (do not map) NL to CR on input.
    iiggnnccrr (--iiggnnccrr)

    iixxoonn (--iixxoonn)
        Enable (disable) START/STOP output control. Output from the system is
        stopped when the system receives STOP and started when the system
        receives START , or if iixxaannyy is set, any character restarts output.
    iixxooffff (--iixxooffff)
        Request that the system send (not send) START/STOP characters when the
        input queue is nearly empty/full.
    iixxaannyy (--iixxaannyy)
        Allow any character (allow only START ) to restart output.
    iimmaaxxbbeell (--iimmaaxxbbeell)
        The system imposes a limit of MAX_INPUT (currently 512) characters in
        the input queue. If imaxbel is set and the input queue limit has been
        reached, subsequent input causes the system to send an ASCII BEL
        character to the output queue (the terminal beeps at you). Otherwise,
        if imaxbel is unset and the input queue is full, the next input
        character causes the entire input and output queues to be discarded.

  OOuuttppuutt mmooddeess

    This corresponds to the c_oflag of the tteerrmmiiooss structure.
    ooppoosstt (--ooppoosstt)

    characteristics of terminal processing and correspond to the c_lflag of
    the tteerrmmiiooss structure.
    iissiigg (--iissiigg)
        Enable (disable) the checking of characters against the special
        control characters INTR, QUIT, and SUSP.
    iiccaannoonn (--iiccaannoonn)
        Enable (disable) canonical input (ERASE and KILL processing).
    iieexxtteenn (--iieexxtteenn)
        Enable (disable) any implementation defined special control characters
        not currently controlled by iiccaannoonn, iissiigg, or iixxoonn.
    eecchhoo (--eecchhoo)

        Echo (do not echo) NL , even if echo is disabled.
    eecchhooccttll (--eecchhooccttll)
        If eecchhooccttll(1) is set, echo control characters as ^X. Otherwise,
        control characters echo as themselves.
    eecchhoopprrtt (--eecchhoopprrtt)
        For printing terminals. If set, echo erased characters backwards
        within "\" and "/". Otherwise, disable this feature.
    nnooffllsshh (--nnooffllsshh)
        Disable (enable) flush after INTR, QUIT, SUSP.
    ttoossttoopp (--ttoossttoopp)
        Send (do not send) SIGTTOU for background output. This causes
        background jobs to stop if they attempt terminal output. The default
        behavior is --ttoossttoopp.
    aallttwweerraassee (--aallttwweerraassee)
        Use (do not use) an alternate word-erase algorithm when processing
        WERASE characters. This alternate algorithm considers sequences of
        alphanumeric/underscores as words. It also skips the first preceding
        character in its classification (as a convenience since the one
        preceding character could have been erased with simply an ERASE
        character.)
    mmddmmbbuuff (--mmddmmbbuuff)
        If set, flow control output based on condition of Carrier Detect.
        Otherwise, writes return an error if Carrier Detect is low (and
        Carrier is not being ignored with the CLOCAL flag.)
    fflluusshhoo (--fflluusshhoo)
        Indicates output is (is not) being discarded.
    ppeennddiinn (--ppeennddiinn)
        Indicates input is (is not) pending after a switch from non-canonical
        to canonical mode and will be re-input when a read operation becomes
        pending or more input arrives.
    iimmeelliinnee (--iimmeelliinnee)
        When enabled, the bottom line of a Console window is left blank. It is
        reserved for use by the Windows Input Method Editor (IME). The Windows
        IME is available as part of the National Language Support (NLS) for
        languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. imeline is applicable
        only for Console window tty devices.
        When a Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications application runs in a console window, the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications
        console window driver is always invoked. This driver may automatically
        enable imeline if the console's input code page is a known double-byte
        code page, i.e. (code page 932, 936, 949 or 950)

  CCoonnttrrooll cchhaarraacctteerrss

    control-character string
        Set control-character to string. If string is a single character, the
        control character is set to that character. If string is the two-
        character sequence "^-" or the string "undef", the control character
        is disabled (that is, it is set to {_POSIX_VDISABLE}. Setting the
        control character also sets the corresponding element of the tteerrmmiiooss
        cc__cccc array.
    bbeellllttiimmee number
        After a bell sounds at the keyboard, any subsequent bells delivered in
        the next number tenths of a second are ignored. This has no effect on
        other characters.
    mmiinn number
    ttiimmee number
        Set the value of mmiinn or ttiimmee to number. MIN and TIME are used in non-

        Disable parenb, and set cs8.
    nnll (--nnll)
        Enable (disable) icrnl. In addition --nnll unsets inlcr and igncr.

    eekk
        Reset ERASE and KILL characters back to system defaults.

    ssaannee
        Resets all modes to reasonable values for interactive terminal use.

    ttttyy
        Set the line discipline to the standard terminal line discipline
        TTYDISC.
    ccrrtt (--ccrrtt)
        Set (disable) all modes suitable for a CRT display device.
    kkeerrnniinnffoo (--kkeerrnniinnffoo)
        Enable (disable) the system generated status line associated with
        processing a STATUS character (usually set to ^T). The status line
        consists of the system load average, the current command name, its
        process identifier (ID), the event the process is waiting on (or the
        status of the process), the user and system times, percent CPU, and
        current memory usage.
    ccoolluummnnss number
        The terminal size is recorded as having number columns. On a Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications
        console window, this will resize the terminal window to have number
        columns, unless the new size is larger than the physical screen.
    ccoollss number
        An alias for ccoolluummnnss.
    rroowwss number
        The terminal size is recorded as having number rows. On a Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications
        console window, this will resize the terminal window to have number
        rows, unless the new size is larger than the physical screen.

    ddeecc
        Set modes suitable for users of Digital Equipment Corporation systems
        ( RASE, KILL, and INTR characters are set to ^?, ^U, and ^C; ixany is
        disabled, and crt is enabled.)
    eexxttpprroocc (--eexxttpprroocc)
        If set, this flag indicates that some amount of terminal processing is
        being performed by either the terminal hardware or by the remote side
        connected to a pty.
    rraaww (--rraaww)
        If set, change the modes of the terminal so that no input or output
        processing is performed. If unset, change the modes of the terminal to
        some reasonable state that performs input and output processing. Note
        that since the terminal driver no longer has a single RAW bit, it is
        not possible to determine which flags were set prior to setting raw.
        This means that unsetting raw might not restore all the setting that
        were previously in effect. To set the terminal into a raw state and
        then accurately restore it, the following shell code is recommended:
        save_state=$(stty -g)
        stty raw
        ...
        stty "$save_state"

    ssiizzee
        The size of the terminal is printed as two numbers on a single line,
        first rows, then columns.

  CCoommppaattiibbiilliittyy mmooddeess

    These modes remain for compatibility with the previous version of the

    aallll
        Reports all the terminal modes as with
        stty -a
        except that the control characters are printed in a columnar format.
