    The ddiiffff33(1) utility compares the contents of three different versions of
    a file, file1, file2 and file3, writing the result to the standard output.
    The options describe different methods of merging and purging the separate
    versions into a new file. The ddiiffff33(1) utility is used by the RCS commands
    to merge specific versions or create new versions.

    --ee
        Produce output in a form suitable as an input script for the eedd(1)
        utility. The script CAN then be used to merge differences common
        between all three files and differences specific to file1 and file3.
        In other words, the --ee option ignores differences specific to file1
        and file2, and those specific to file2 and file3. It is useful for
        backing out changes specific to file2 only.

    --xx
        Produce an output script suitable for eedd(1) with changes specific only
        to all three versions.

    --33
        Produce an output script suitable for eedd(1) with changes specific only
        to file3.

    --EE
        Similar to --ee but treat overlapping changes (that is, changes that
        would be noted with ==== in the normal listing) differently. The
        overlapping lines from both files will be inserted by the edit script,
        bracketed by "<<<<<<" and ">>>>>>" lines.

    --XX
        Similar to --xx,, but treat overlapping changes (as described for --EE)
        differently. The overlapping lines from both files will be inserted by
        the edit script, bracketed by "<<<<<<" and ">>>>>>" lines.

    The --EE option is used by RCS mmeerrggee(1) to ensure that overlapping changes
    in the merged files are preserved and are therefore noticeable.

    For example, suppose lines 7-8 are changed in both file1 and file2.
    Applying to file1 the edit script generated by the following command:

    diff3 -E file1 file2 file3

    results in the file:

    lines 1-6
    of file1
    <<<<<<< file1
    lines 7-8
    of file1
    =======
    lines 7-8
    of file3
    >>>>>>> file3
    rest of file1

    The default output of ddiiffff33(1) makes notation of the differences between
    all files, as well as those differences specific to each pair of files.
    The changes are described by the commands necessary for eedd(1) to create
    the desired target from the different versions. See ddiiffff(1) for a
    description of the commands.

    ====
        The lines beneath this notation are ranges of lines that are different
        between all files.
    ====n
        The lines beneath this notation are ranges of lines that are
        exclusively different in file n.

  FFIILLEESS

    ddiiffff33(1) uses of the following files:
    //ttmmpp//dd33?????
        Temporary files.

    //bbiinn//ddiiffff33
        The executable. The root of the path depends upon where the SUA
        distribution is installed.

  BBUUGGSS

    The --ee option cannot detect and change lines that have a period (..) as the
    first and only character on the line. The resulting script fails on that
    line because .. is an eedd(1) editing command.
