    The ddaattee(1) utility displays the current date and time when invoked
    without arguments. Providing arguments will format the date and time in a
    user-defined way.

    If the argument provided is the month (mm, as a number), day (dd), hour
    (HH, as a number using the 24-hour system), minute (MM) and optionally the
    year (yy--current year if omitted), the utility attempts to set the system
    date and time. Only a user with appropriate privileges may set the date.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --bb
        Accept the date in BSD-style "ccyymmddHHMM.SS". The default is
        "mmddHHMMyy" to conform to the standard.
        Only the minutes (MM) are required; hours (HH), days (dd), month (mm),
        the century (CC), and seconds (SS) are all optional.

    --jj
        Do not apply the change. This is useful for testing.

    --nn
	The -n option suppresses the behavior of informing the time daemon
        so that all machines in the local group have the time updated.
        This is the Interix default behavior and causes the time to be set
        only on the current machine.

    --rr seconds
        Display the date and time in seconds from the UNIX Epoch (January 1,
        1970)

    --uu
        Display the date in Universal Coordinated Time (UCT).

    ++format
        Display the date and time in the format specified by format. Format
        can contain arbitrary text and any of the following conversion
        specifications:
        %%AA           The full weekday name.

        %%aa           The abbreviated weekday name, where the abbreviation is

    The format string for the default display is:

    %a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y%n

  NNOOTTEESS

    Only users who have been granted the permission SE_SYSTEMTIME_PRIVILEGE
    can set the date and time.

    The specifiers %c, %D, %x, and %y all represent the year as a two-digit
    variable. Examine any shell scripts that make use of this output to ensure
    that they will function correctly.

    In the POSIX or C locale, the appropriate date representation is %%mm//%%dd//%%yy;
    the appropriate time representation is %%HH::%%MM::%%SS.
