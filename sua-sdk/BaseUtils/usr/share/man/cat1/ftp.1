    The ffttpp utility is the user interface to the ARPANET standard File
    Transfer Protocol. The program allows a user to transfer files to and from
    a remote network site.

    The latter three usage formats will fetch a file using either the HTTP or
    FTP protocols into the current directory. This is ideal for scripts. Refer
    to AUTO-FETCHING FILES below for more information.

    The options are as follows:

    --AA
        Force active mode ftp. By default, ffttpp will try to usepassive mode ftp
        and fall back to active mode if passive is notsupported by the server.
        This option causes ffttpp to always use anactive connection. It is only
        useful for connecting to very oldservers that do not implement passive
        mode properly.

    --aa
        Causes ffttpp to bypass the normal login procedure and use an anonymous
        login instead.

    --dd
        Enables debugging.

    --ee
        Disables command line editing. Useful for Emacs ange-ftp.

    --ff
        Use the proxy information stored in the registry if it is avail-
        able for the user that is running the utility.  Proxy information
        is stored on a per user basis.  If the information is not avail-
        able then this option is ignored.  This is the same registry
        information used by Internet Explorer.  This option overrides the
        use of the environment variables _f_t_p___p_r_o_x_y and _h_t_t_p___p_r_o_x_y.  Note
        that proxies are only used when the ftp file location is URL
        based.

    --FF _f_t_p_p_r_o_x_y
        _f_t_p_p_r_o_x_y is an ftp URL proxy to be used. This option overrides
        the use of the environment variables _f_t_p___p_r_o_x_y and _h_t_t_p___p_r_o_x_y and
        has preference over the '-f' option.  Note that proxies are only
        used when the ftp file location is URL based.

    --gg
        Disables file name globbing.

    --ii
        Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

    --mm
        Causes ffttpp to always display the progress meter in cases where it
        would not do so by default.

    --nn
        Restrains ffttpp from attempting "auto-login" upon initial connection. If
        auto-login is enabled, ffttpp will check the ..nneettrrcc (see below) file in
        the user's home directory for an entry describing an account on the
        remote machine. If no entry exists, ffttpp will prompt for the remote
        machine login name (default is the user identity on the local
        machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with
        which to login.
    --oo output
        When fetching a single file or url, save the contents in output. To
        make the contents go to stdout, use "-" for output.

    --pp
        Enable passive mode operation for use behind connection filtering
        firewalls. This option has been deprecated as ffttpp now tries to use
        passive mode by default, falling back to active mode if the server
        does not support passive connections.
    --PP port
        Sets the port number to port.
    --rr number
        Retry to connect if failed, pausing for number of seconds.

    --tt
        Enables packet tracing.

    --vv
        Enable verbose mode. This is the default if input is from a terminal.
        Forces ffttpp to show all responses from the remote server, as well as
        report on data transfer statistics.

    --VV
        Disable verbose mode, overriding the default of enabled when input is
        from a terminal.

    The client host with which ffttpp is to communicate may be specified on the
    command line. If this is done, ffttpp will immediately attempt to establish a
    connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, ffttpp will enter its
    command interpreter and await instructions from the user. When ffttpp is
    awaiting commands the prompt "ftp>" is provided to the user. The following
    commands are recognized by ffttpp:

    !! [command [args]]
        Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine. If there are
        arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute directly,
        with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.
    $$ macro-name [args]
        Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the mmaaccddeeff command.
        Arguments are passed to the macro unglobbed.
    aaccccoouunntt [passwd]
        Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system for access
        to resources once a login has been successfully completed. If no
        argument is included, the user will be prompted for an account
        password in a non-echoing input mode.
    aappppeenndd local-file [remote-file]
        Append a local file to a file on the remote machine. If remote-file is
        left unspecified, the local file name is used in naming the remote
        file after being altered by any nnttrraannss or nnmmaapp setting. File transfer
        uses the current settings for ttyyppee, ffoorrmmaatt, mmooddee, and ssttrruuccttuurree.

    aasscciiii
        Set the file transfer ttyyppee to network ASCII. This is the default type.

    bbeellll
        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer command is
        completed.

    bbiinnaarryy
        Set the file transfer ttyyppee to support binary image transfer.

    bbyyee
        Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit ffttpp. An end-
        of-file will also terminate the session and exit.

    ccaassee
        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during mmggeett commands.
        When ccaassee is on (default is off), remote computer file names with all
        letters in upper case are written in the local directory with the
        letters mapped to lower case.
    ccdd remote-directory
        Change the working directory on the remote machine to remote-
        directory.

    ccdduupp
        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent of the
        current remote machine working directory.
    cchhmmoodd mode file-name
        Change the permission modes of the file file-name on the remote system
        to mode.

    cclloossee
        Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and return to the
        command interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.

    ccrr
        Toggle carriage return stripping during ASCII type file retrieval.
        Records are denoted by a carriage return/linefeed sequence during
        ASCII type file transfer. When ccrr is on (the default), carriage
        returns are stripped from this sequence to conform with the UNIX
        single linefeed record delimiter. Records on non-UNIX remote systems
        may contain single linefeeds; when an ASCII type transfer is made,
        these linefeeds may be distinguished from a record delimiter only when
        ccrr is off.
    ddeelleettee remote-file
        Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.
    ddeebbuugg [debug-value]
        Toggle debugging mode. If an optional debug-value is specified it is
        used to set the debugging level. When debugging is on, ffttpp prints each
        command sent to the remote machine, preceded by the string '-->'.
    ddiirr [remote-directory [local-file]]
        A synonym for llss.

    ddiissccoonnnneecctt
        A synonym for cclloossee.

    eeddiitt
        Toggle command line editing, and context sensitive command and file
        completion. This is automatically enabled if input is from a terminal,
        and disabled otherwise.

    eeppssvv44
        Toggle use of EPSV/EPRT command on IPv4 connection.

    eexxiitt
        A synonym for bbyyee.
    ffttpp host [port]
        A synonym for ooppeenn.
    ffoorrmm format
        Set the file transfer ffoorrmm to format. The default format is "file".
    ggeett remote-file [local-file]
        Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine. If the
        local file name is not specified, it is given the same name it has on
        the remote machine, subject to alteration by the current ccaassee, nnttrraannss,
        and nnmmaapp settings. The current settings for ttyyppee, ffoorrmm, mmooddee, and
        ssttrruuccttuurree are used while transferring the file.
    ggaattee [host [port]]
        Toggle gate-ftp mode. This will not be permitted if the gate-ftp
        server hasn't been set (either explicitly by the user, or from the
        FTPSERVER environment variable). If host is given, then gate-ftp mode
        will be enabled, and the gate-ftp server will be set to host. If port
        is also given, that will be used as the port to connect to on the
        gate-ftp server.

    gglloobb
        Toggle filename expansion for mmddeelleettee, mmggeett and mmppuutt. If globbing is
        turned off with gglloobb, the file name arguments are taken literally and
        not expanded. Globbing for mmppuutt is done as in csh(1). For mmddeelleettee and
        mmggeett, each remote file name is expanded separately on the remote
        machine and the lists are not merged. Expansion of a directory name is
        likely to be different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file:
        the exact result depends on the foreign operating system and ftp
        server, and can be previewed by doing "mls remote-files -". Note: mmggeett
        and mmppuutt are not meant to transfer entire directory subtrees of files.
        That can be done by transferring a tar(1) archive of the subtree (in
        binary mode).
    hhaasshh [size]
        Toggle hash mark ('#') printing for each data block transferred. The
        size of a data block defaults to 1024 bytes. This can be changed by
        specifying size in bytes.
    hheellpp [command]
        Print an informative message about the meaning of command. If no
        argument is given, ffttpp prints a list of the known commands.
    iiddllee [seconds]
        Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds seconds. If
        seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer is printed.
    llccdd [directory]
        Change the working directory on the local machine. If no directory is
        specified, the user's home directory is used.
    lleessss file
        A synonym for ppaaggee.

    llppwwdd
        Print the working directory on the local machine.
    llss [remote-directory [local-file]]
        Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote machine.
        The listing includes any system-dependent information that the server
        chooses to include; for example, most UNIX systems will produce output
        from the command 'ls -l'. If remote-directory is left unspecified, the
        current working directory is used. If interactive prompting is on, ffttpp
        will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the
        target local file for receiving llss output. If no local file is
        specified, or if local-file is "-", the output is sent to the
        terminal.
    mmaaccddeeff macro-name
        Define a macro. Subsequent lines are stored as the macro macro-name; a
        null line (consecutive newline characters in a file or carriage
        returns from the terminal) terminates macro input mode. There is a
        limit of 16 macros and 4096 total characters in all defined macros.
        Macros remain defined until a cclloossee command is executed. The macro
        processor interprets '$' and '\' as special characters. A '$' followed
        by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the corresponding argument on
        the macro invocation command line. A '$' followed by an 'i' tells the
        macro processor that the executing macro is to be looped. On the first
        pass '$i' is replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation
        command line, on the second pass it is replaced by the second
        argument, and so on. A '\' followed by any character is replaced by
        that character. Use the '\' to prevent special treatment of the '$'.
    mmddeelleettee [remote-files]
        Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.
    mmddiirr remote-files local-file
        A synonym for mmllss.
    mmggeett remote-files
        Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a ggeett for each
        file name thus produced. See gglloobb for details on the filename
        expansion. Resulting file names will then be processed according to
        ccaassee, nnttrraannss, and nnmmaapp settings. Files are transferred into the local
        working directory, which can be changed with 'lcd directory'; new
        local directories can be created with '! mkdir directory'.
    mmkkddiirr directory-name
        Make a directory on the remote machine.
    mmllss remote-files local-file
        Like llss, except multiple remote files may be specified, and the local-
        file must be specified. If interactive prompting is on, ffttpp will
        prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the target
        local file for receiving mmllss output.
    mmooddee [mode-name]
        Set the file transfer mmooddee to mode-name. The default mode is "stream"
        mode.
    mmooddttiimmee file-name
        Show the last modification time of the file on the remote machine.
    mmoorree file
        A synonym for ppaaggee.
    mmppuutt local-files
        Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as arguments and do
        a ppuutt for each file in the resulting list. See gglloobb for details of
        filename expansion. Resulting file names will then be processed
        according to nnttrraannss and nnmmaapp settings.
    mmsseenndd local-files
        A synonym for mmppuutt.
    nneewweerr file-name
        Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file is more
        recent than the file on the current system. If the file does not exist
        on the current system, the remote file is considered nneewweerr. Otherwise,
        this command is identical to get.
    nnlliisstt [remote-directory [local-file]]
        Print a list of the files in a directory on the remote machine. If
        remote-directory is left unspecified, the current working directory is
        used. If interactive prompting is on, ffttpp will prompt the user to
        verify that the last argument is indeed the target local file for
        receiving nnlliisstt output. If no local file is specified, or if local-
        file is "-", the output is sent to the terminal. Note that on some
        servers, the nnlliisstt command will only return information on normal
        files (not directories or special files).
    nnmmaapp [inpattern outpattern]
        Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism. If no arguments are
        specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset. If arguments are
        specified, remote filenames are mapped during mmppuutt commands and ppuutt
        commands issued without a specified remote target filename. If
        arguments are specified, local filenames are mapped during mmggeett
        commands and ggeett commands issued without a specified local target
        filename. This command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote
        computer with different file naming conventions or practices. The
        mapping follows the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern. inpattern
        is a template for incoming filenames (which may have already been
        processed according to the nnttrraannss and ccaassee settings). Variable
        templating is accomplished by including the sequences '$1', '$2', '$9'
        in inpattern. Use '\' to prevent this special treatment of the '$'
        character. All other characters are treated literally, and are used to
        determine the nnmmaapp inpattern variable values. For example, given
        inpattern $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data", $1 would have
        the value "mydata", and $2 would have the value "data". The outpattern
        determines the resulting mapped filename. The sequences '$1', '$2',
        '$9' are replaced by any value resulting from the inpattern template.
        The sequence '$0' is replaced by the original filename. Additionally,
        the sequence '[seq1, seq2]' is replaced by [seq1] if seq1 is not a
        null string; otherwise it is replaced by seq2. For example, the
        command
        nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]
        would yield the output filename myfile.data, for input filenames
        myfile.data and myfile.data.old, myfile.file for the input filename
        myfile, and myfile.myfile for the input filename .myfile. Spaces may
        be included in outpattern, as in the example
        nmap $1 sed "s/  *$//" > $1 .
        Use the '\' character to prevent special treatment of the '$', '[',
        ']', and ',' characters.
    nnttrraannss [inchars [outchars]]
        Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism. If no
        arguments are specified, the filename character translation mechanism
        is unset. If arguments are specified, characters in remote filenames
        are translated during mmppuutt commands and ppuutt commands issued without a
        specified remote target filename. If arguments are specified,
        characters in local filenames are translated during mmggeett commands and
        ggeett commands issued without a specified local target filename. This
        command is useful when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer with
        different file naming conventions or practices. Characters in a
        filename matching a character in inchars are replaced with the
        corresponding character in outchars. If the character's position in
        inchars is longer than the length of outchars, the character is
        deleted from the file name.
    ooppeenn host [port]
        Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server. An optional
        port number may be supplied in which case ffttpp will attempt to contact
        an FTP server at that port. If the aauuttoo--llooggiinn option is on (default),
        ffttpp will also attempt to automatically log the user in to the FTP
        server (see below).
    ppaaggee file
        Retrieve ffiillee and display with the program defined in PAGER
        (defaulting to more(1) if PAGER is null or not defined).

    ppaassssiivvee
        Toggle passive mode. If passive mode is turned on (default is on), the
        ftp client will send a PASV command for all data connections instead
        of the usual PORT command. The PASV command requests that the remote
        server open a port for the data connection and return the address of
        that port. The remote server listens on that port and the client
        connects to it. When using the more traditional PORT command, the
        client listens on a port and sends that address to the remote server,
        who connects back to it. Passive mode is useful when using ffttpp through
        a gateway router or host that controls the directionality of traffic.
        (Note that though ftp servers are required to support the PASV command
        by RFC 1123, some do not.)

    pprreesseerrvvee
        Toggle preservation of modification times on retrieved files.

    pprrooggrreessss
        Toggle display of transfer progress bar. The progress bar will be
        disabled for a transfer that has local-file as "-" or a command that
        starts with '|'. Refer to FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS for more
        information.

    pprroommpptt
        Toggle interactive prompting. Interactive prompting occurs during
        multiple file transfers to allow the user to selectively retrieve or
        store files. If prompting is turned off (default is on), any mmggeett or
        mmppuutt will transfer all files, and any mmddeelleettee will delete all files.
        When prompting is on, the following commands are available at a
        prompt:

        nn
            Do not transfer the file.

        aa
            Answer "yes" to the current file and automatically answer "yes" to
            any remaining files for the current command.

        pp
            Answer "yes" to the current file and turn off prompt mode (as if
            "prompt off" had been given).
        Any other reponse will answer "yes" to the current file.
    pprrooxxyy ftp-command
        Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection. This command
        allows simultaneous connection to two remote ftp servers for
        transferring files between the two servers. The first pprrooxxyy command
        should be an ooppeenn, to establish the secondary control connection.
        Enter the command pprrooxxyy? to see other ftp commands executable on the
        secondary connection. The following commands behave differently when
        prefaced by pprrooxxyy: ooppeenn will not define new macros during the auto-
        login process, cclloossee will not erase existing macro definitions, ggeett
        and mmggeett transfer files from the host on the primary control
        connection to the host on the secondary control connection, and ppuutt,
        mmppuutt, and aappppeenndd transfer files from the host on the secondary control
        connection to the host on the primary control connection. Third party
        file transfers depend upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by
        the server on the secondary control connection.
    ppuutt local-file [remote-file]
        Store a local file on the remote machine. If remote-file is left
        unspecified, the local file name is used after processing according to
        any nnttrraannss or nnmmaapp settings in naming the remote file. File transfer
        uses the current settings for ttyyppee, ffoorrmmaatt, mmooddee, and ssttrruuccttuurree.

    ppwwdd
        Print the name of the current working directory on the remote machine.

    qquuiitt
        A synonym for bbyyee.
    qquuoottee arg1 arg2 ...
        The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server.
    rreeccvv remote-file [local-file]
        A synonym for ggeett.
    rreeggeett remote-file [local-file]
        Reget acts like get, except that if local-file exists and is smaller
        than remote-file, local-file is presumed to be a partially transferred
        copy of remote-file and the transfer is continued from the apparent
        point of failure. This command is useful when transferring very large
        files over networks that are prone to dropping connections.
    rreemmootteehheellpp [command-name]
        Request help from the remote FTP server. If a command-name is
        specified it is supplied to the server as well.
    rrssttaattuuss [file-name]
        With no arguments, show status of remote machine. If file-name is
        specified, show status of file-name on remote machine.
    rreennaammee [from [to]]
        Rename the file from on the remote machine to the file to.

    rreesseett
        Clear reply queue. This command re-synchronizes command/reply
        sequencing with the remote ftp server. Resynchronization may be
        necessary following a violation of the ftp protocol by the remote
        server.
    rreessttaarrtt marker
        Restart the immediately following ggeett or ppuutt at the indicated marker.
        On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte offset into the file.
    rrmmddiirr directory-name
        Delete a directory on the remote machine.

    rruunniiqquuee
        Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique filenames. If
        a file already exists with a name equal to the target local filename
        for a ggeett or mmggeett command, a ".1" is appended to the name. If the
        resulting name matches another existing file, a ".2" is appended to
        the original name. If this process continues up to ".99", an error
        message is printed, and the transfer does not take place. The
        generated unique filename will be reported. Note that rruunniiqquuee will not
        affect local files generated from a shell command (see below). The
        default value is off.
    sseenndd local-file [remote-file]
        A synonym for ppuutt.

    sseennddppoorrtt
        Toggle the use of PORT commands. By default, ffttpp will attempt to use a
        PORT command when establishing a connection for each data transfer.
        The use of PORT commands can prevent delays when performing multiple
        file transfers. If the PORT command fails, ffttpp will use the default
        data port. When the use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will
        be made to use PORT commands for each data transfer. This is useful
        for certain FTP implementations which do ignore PORT commands but,
        incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.
    ssiittee arg1 arg2 ...
        The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server
        as a SITE command.
    ssiizzee file-name
        Return size of file-name on remote machine.

    ssttaattuuss
        Show the current status of ffttpp.
    ssttrruucctt [struct-name]
        Set the file transfer structure to struct-name. By default "stream"
        structure is used.

    ssuunniiqquuee
        Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file names.
        Remote ftp server must support ftp protocol STOU command for
        successful completion. The remote server will report unique name.
        Default value is off.

    ssyysstteemm
        Show the type of operating system running on the remote machine.

    tteenneexx
        Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk to TENEX machines.

    ttrraaccee
        Toggle packet tracing.
    ttyyppee [type-name]
        Set the file transfer ttyyppee to type-name. If no type is specified, the
        current type is printed. The default type is network ASCII.
    uummaasskk [newmask]
        Set the default umask on the remote server to newmask. If newmask is
        omitted, the current umask is printed.
    uusseerr user-name [password [account]]
        Identify yourself to the remote FTP server. If the password is not
        specified and the server requires it, ffttpp will prompt the user for it
        (after disabling local echo). If an account field is not specified,
        and the FTP server requires it, the user will be prompted for it. If
        an account field is specified, an account command will be relayed to
        the remote server after the login sequence is completed if the remote
        server did not require it for logging in. Unless ffttpp is invoked with
        "auto-login" disabled, this process is done automatically on initial
        connection to the FTP server.

    vveerrbboossee
        Toggle verbose mode. In verbose mode, all responses from the FTP
        server are displayed to the user. In addition, if verbose is on, when
        a file transfer completes, statistics regarding the efficiency of the
        transfer are reported. By default, verbose is on.
    ?? [command]
        A synonym for hheellpp.

    Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote (")
    marks.

    Commands which toggle settings can take an explicit oonn or ooffff argument to
    force the setting appropriately.

    If ffttpp receives a SIGINFO (see the "status" argument of ssttttyy(1)) signal
    whilst a transfer is in progress, the current transfer rate statistics
    will be written to the standard error output, in the same format as the
    standard completion message.

  AAUUTTOO--FFEETTCCHHIINNGG FFIILLEESS

    In addition to standard commands, this version of ffttpp supports an auto-
    fetch feature. To enable auto-fetch, simply pass the list of hostnames/
    files on the command line.

    The following formats are valid syntax for an auto-fetch element:
    host:://file
        "Classic" ftp format
    ffttpp::////[user::password@@]host[::port]//file
        An ftp URL, retrieved using the ftp protocol if ftp_proxy isn't
        defined. Otherwise, transfer using http via the proxy defined in
        ftp_proxy. If user:password@ is given and ftp_proxy isn't defined,
        login as user with a password of password.
    hhttttpp::////host[::port]//file
        An http URL, retrieved using the http protocol. If http_proxy is
        defined, it is used as a URL to an HTTP proxy server.

    If a classic format or a ftp URL format has a trailing '/', then ffttpp will
    connect to the site and ccdd to the directory given as the path, and leave
    the user in interactive mode ready for further input.

    If successive auto-fetch ftp elements refer to the same host, then the
    connection is maintained between transfers, reducing overhead on
    connection creation and deletion.

    If ffiillee contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see gglloobb),
    then the equivalent of mmggeett ffiillee is performed.

    If no --oo option is specified, and the directory component of ffiillee contains
    no globbing characters, then it is stored in the current directory as the
    basename(1) of ffiillee. Otherwise, the remote name is used as the local name.

  AABBOORRTTIINNGG AA FFIILLEE TTRRAANNSSFFEERR

    To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).
    Sending transfers will be immediately halted. Receiving transfers will be
    halted by sending an ftp protocol ABOR command to the remote server, and
    discarding any further data received. The speed at which this is
    accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR processing.
    If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, an 'ftp>' prompt
    will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the
    requested file.

    The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when ffttpp has completed
    any local processing and is awaiting a reply from the remote server. A
    long delay in this mode may result from the ABOR processing described
    above, or from unexpected behavior by the remote server, including
    violations of the ftp protocol. If the delay results from unexpected
    remote server behavior, the local ffttpp program must be killed by hand.

  FFIILLEE NNAAMMIINNGG CCOONNVVEENNTTIIOONNSS

    Files specified as arguments to ffttpp commands are processed according to
    the following rules.

   1.     If the file name "-" is specified, the standard input (forreading)
          or standard output (for writing) is used.
   2.     If the first character of the file name is '|', the remainder of the
          argument is interpreted as a shell command. ffttpp then forks a shell,
          using popen(3) with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from
          the standard output (standard input). If the shell command includes
          spaces, the argument must be quoted; e.g., "" ls -lt"". A
          particularly useful example of this mechanism is: "dir |more".
   3.     Failing the above checks, if "globbing" is enabled, local file names
          are expanded according to the rules used in the csh(1); c.f. the
          gglloobb command. If the ffttpp command expects a single local file (e.g.,
          ppuutt), only the first filename generated by the "globbing" operation
          is used.
   4.     For mmggeett commands and ggeett commands with unspecified local file
          names, the local filename is the remote filename, which may be
          altered by a ccaassee, nnttrraannss, or nnmmaapp setting. The resulting filename
          may then be altered if rruunniiqquuee is on.
   5.     For mmppuutt commands and ppuutt commands with unspecified remote file
          names, the remote filename is the local filename, which may be
          altered by a nnttrraannss or nnmmaapp setting. The resulting filename may then
          be altered by the remote server if ssuunniiqquuee is on.

  FFIILLEE TTRRAANNSSFFEERR PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS

    The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
    transfer. The ttyyppee may be one of "ascii", "image" (binary), "ebcdic", and
    "local byte size" (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly). ffttpp supports the
    ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for tteenneexx
    mode transfers.

    ffttpp supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer
    parameters: mmooddee, ffoorrmm, and ssttrruucctt.

  TTHHEE ..nneettrrcc FFIILLEE

    The ..nneettrrcc file contains login and initialization information used by the
    auto-login process. It resides in the user's home directory. The following
    tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs, or new-
    lines:
    mmaacchhiinnee name
        Identify a remote machine name. The auto-login process searches the
        ..nneettrrcc file for a mmaacchhiinnee token that matches the remote machine
        specified on the ffttpp command line or as an ooppeenn command argument. Once
        a match is made, the subsequent ..nneettrrcc tokens are processed, stopping
        when the end of file is reached or another mmaacchhiinnee or a ddeeffaauulltt token
        is encountered.

    ddeeffaauulltt
        This is the same as mmaacchhiinnee name except that ddeeffaauulltt matches any name.
        There can be only one ddeeffaauulltt token, and it must be after all mmaacchhiinnee
        tokens. This is normally used as:
        default login anonymous password user@site
        thereby giving the user automatic anonymous ftp login to machines not
        specified in ..nneettrrcc. This can be overridden by using the --nn flag to
        disable auto-login.
    llooggiinn name
        Identify a user on the remote machine. If this token is present, the
        auto-login process will initiate a login using the specified name.
    ppaasssswwoorrdd string
        Supply a password. If this token is present, the auto-login process
        will supply the specified string if the remote server requires a
        password as part of the login process. Note that if this token is
        present in the ..nneettrrcc file for any user other than anonymous, ffttpp will
        abort the auto-login process if the ..nneettrrcc is readable by anyone
        besides the user.
    aaccccoouunntt string
        Supply an additional account password. If this token is present, the
        auto-login process will supply the specified string if the remote
        server requires an additional account password, or the auto-login
        process will initiate an ACCT command if it does not.
    mmaaccddeeff name
        Define a macro. This token functions like the ffttpp mmaaccddeeff command
        functions. A macro is defined with the specified name; its contents
        begin with the next ..nneettrrcc line and continue until a null line
        (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered. If a macro named
        iinniitt is defined, it is automatically executed as the last step in the
        auto-login process.

  CCOOMMMMAANNDD LLIINNEE EEDDIITTIINNGG

    The ffttpp utility supports interactive command line editing, via the
    editline(3) library. It is enabled with the eeddiitt command, and is enabled
    by default if input is from a tty. Previous lines can be recalled and
    edited with the arrow keys, and other GNU Emacs-style editing keys may be
    used as well.

    The editline(3) library is configured with a .editrc file - refer to
    editrc(5) for more information.

    An extra key binding is available to ffttpp to provide context sensitive
    command and filename completion (including remote file completion). To use
    this, bind a key to the editline(3) command ffttpp--ccoommpplleettee. By default, this
    is bound to the TAB key.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    The ffttpp utility utilizes the following environment variables:

    FTPMODE
        Overrides the default operation mode. Recognized values are:

        passive
            passive mode ftp only

        active
            active mode ftp only

        auto
            automatic determination of passive or active (this is the default)

        gate
            gate-ftp mode

    FTPSERVER
        Host to use as gate-ftp server when ggaattee is enabled.

    FTPSERVERPORT
        Port to use when connecting to gate-ftp server when ggaattee is enabled.
        Default is port returned by a ggeettsseerrvvbbyynnaammee() lookup of "ftpgate/tcp".

    HOME
        For default location of a ..nneettrrcc file, if one exists.

    PAGER
        Used by ppaaggee to display files.

    SHELL
        For default shell.

    TMPDIR
        Directory to put temporary files.

    ftp_proxy
        URL of FTP proxy to use when making FTP URL requests (if not defined,
        use the standard ftp protocol).

    http_proxy
        URL of HTTP proxy to use when making HTTP URL requests.

    Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the
    remote server.

    An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ASCII-mode
    transfer code has been corrected. This correction may result in incorrect
    transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the ASCII type.
    Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.
