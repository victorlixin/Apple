    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    The ttyyppeesseett(1) command displays or sets parameter attributes. With no name
    arguments, parameter attributes are displayed: if no options arg used, the
    current attributes of all parameters are printed as ttyyppeesseett(1) commands;
    if an option is given (or -- with no option letter) all parameters and
    their values with the specified attributes are printed; if options are
    introduced with ++, parameter values are not printed.

    If name arguments are given, the attributes of the named parameters are
    set (--) or cleared (++). Values for parameters can optionally be specified.
    If ttyyppeesseett(1) is used inside a function, any newly created parameters are
    local to the function.

    When --ff is used, ttyyppeesseett(1) operates on the attributes of functions. As
    with parameters, if there are no instances of name given, functions are
    listed with their values (that is, definitions) unless options are
    introduced with ++, in which case only the function names are reported.

    --LLn
        Left-justify attribute: n specifies the field width. If n is not
        specified, the current width of a parameter (or the width of its first
        assigned value) is used. Leading white space (and zeros, if used with
        the --ZZ option) is stripped. If necessary, values are either truncated
        or space padded to fit the field width.

    --RRn
        Right-justify attribute: n specifies the field width. If n is not
        specified, the current width of a parameter (or the width of its first
        assigned value) is used. Trailing white spaces are stripped. If
        necessary, values are either stripped of leading characters or space
        padded to make them fit the field width.

    --ZZn
        Zero fill attribute: if not combined with --LL, this is the same as --RR,
        except zero padding is used instead of space padding.

    --iin
        Integer attribute: n specifies the base to use when displaying the
        integer (if not specified, the base given in the first assignment is
        used). Parameters with this attribute can be assigned values
        containing arithmetic expressions.

    --UU
        Unsigned integer attribute: integers are printed as unsigned values
        (only useful when combined with the --ii option). This option is not in
        the original Korn shell.

    --ff
        Function mode: display or set functions and their attributes instead
        of parameters.

    --ll
        Lowercase attribute: all uppercase characters in values are converted
        to lowercase. (In the original Korn shell, this parameter meant "long
        integer" when used with the --ii option).

    --rr
        Read-only attribute: parameters with the this attribute cannot be
        assigned to or unset. Once this attribute is set, it cannot be turned
        off.

    --tt
        Tag attribute: has no meaning to the shell; provided for application
        use. For functions, --tt is the trace attribute. When functions with the
        trace attribute are executed, the xxttrraaccee (--xx) shell option is
        temporarily turned on.

    --uu
        Uppercase attribute: all lowercase characters in values are converted
        to uppercase. (In the original Korn shell, this parameter meant
        "unsigned integer" when used with the --ii option, which meant uppercase
        letters would never be used for bases greater than 10. See the --
        UU option).
        For functions, --uu is the undefined attribute. See the section on
        functions for the implications of this.

    --xx
        Export attribute: parameters (or functions) are placed in the
        environment of any executed commands. Exported functions are not yet
        implemented.
