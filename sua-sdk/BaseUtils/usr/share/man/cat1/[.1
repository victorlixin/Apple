    The tteesstt(1) utility evaluates the expression and, if it evaluates to true,
    returns a zero (true) exit status; otherwise it returns 1 (false). If
    there is no expression, test also returns 1 (false).

    All operators and flags are separate arguments to the tteesstt(1) utility.

    The following primaries are used to construct expression:
    --bb file
        True if file exists and is a block special file.
    --cc file
        True if file exists and is a character special file.
    --dd file
        True if file exists and is a directory.
    --ee file
        True if file exists (regardless of type).
    --ff file
        True if file exists and is a regular file.
    --gg file
        True if file exists and its set group identifier (ID) flag is set.
    --nn string
        True if the length of string is nonzero.
    --pp file
        True if file is a named pipe (first-in/first-out [FIFO]).
    --rr file
        True if file exists and is readable.
    --ss file
        True if file exists and has a size greater than zero.
    --tt file_descriptor
        True if the file whose file descriptor number is file_descriptor
        (default 1) is open and is associated with a terminal.
    --uu file
        True if file exists and its set user ID flag is set.
    --ww file
        True if file exists and is writable. True indicates only that the
        write flag is on. The file is not writable on a read-only file system
        even if this test indicates true.
    --xx file
        True if file exists and is executable. True indicates only that the
        execute flag is on. If file is a directory, true indicates that file
        can be searched.
    --zz string
        True if the length of string is zero.

    string
        True if string is not the null string.
    s1 == s2
        True if the strings s1 and s2 are identical.
    s1 !!== s2
        True if the strings s1 and s2 are not identical.
    n1 --eeqq n2
        True if the integers n1 and n2 are algebraically equal.
    n1 --nnee n2
        True if the integers n1 and n2 are not algebraically equal.
    n1 --ggtt n2
        True if the integer n1 is algebraically greater than the integer n2.
    n1 --ggee n2
        True if the integer n1 is algebraically greater than or equal to the
        integer n2.
    n1 --lltt n2
        True if the integer n1 is algebraically less than the integer n2.
    n1 --llee n2
        True if the integer n1 is algebraically less than or equal to the
        integer n2.

    These primaries can be combined with the following operators:
    !! expression
        True if expression is false.
    expression1 --aa expression2
        True if both expression1 and expression2 are true.
    expression1 --oo expression2
        True if either expression1 or expression2 are true.
    ((expression))
        True if expression is true.

    The --aa operator has higher precedence than the --oo operator.

    The tteesstt(1) utility exits with one of the following values:

    0
        Expression evaluated to true.

    1
        Expression evaluated to false or expression was missing.

    >1
        An error occurred.
