    The ffiinnggeerrdd daemon is a simple protocol based on RFC1288 that provides an
    interface to the nnaammee and _ff_ii_nn_gg_ee_rr(1) programs at several network sites. The
    program returns a user-friendly status report on either the system at the
    moment or a particular person in depth. There is no required format, and
    the protocol consists mostly of specifying a single command line.

    The ffiinnggeerrdd daemon is started by _ii_nn_ee_tt_dd(1), which listens for transmission
    control protocol (TCP) requests at port 79. Once connected, it reads a
    single command line terminated by a <CRLF>, which is passed to ffiinnggeerr. The
    ffiinnggeerrdd daemon closes its connections as soon as the output is finished.

    If the command line is null (that is, just a <CRLF> is sent), ffiinnggeerr
    returns a default report that lists all people logged onto the system at
    that moment.

    If a user name is specified (for example, eerriicc<CRLF>), the response lists
    more extended information only for that particular user, whether the user
    is logged on or not. Allowable names in the command line include both user
    names and full names. If a name is ambiguous, all possible derivations are
    returned.

    The following options can be passed to ffiinnggeerrdd as server program arguments
    in //eettcc//iinneettdd..ccoonnff:

    --PP
        Prevent ffiinnggeerrdd from displaying the contents of the ..ppllaann and ..pprroojjeecctt
        files.

    --SS
        Print user information in short mode, one line per user. This
        overrides the wwhhooiiss switch that might be passed in from the remote
        client.

    --ll
        Enable logging. The name of the host originating the query is reported
        through _ss_yy_ss_ll_oo_gg(3) at LOG_NOTICE priority.

    --ss
        Enable secure mode. Forwarding of queries to other remote hosts is
        denied.
    --pp filename
        Use an alternate program as the local information provider. The
        default local program executed by ffiinnggeerrdd is ffiinnggeerr. By specifying a
        customized local server, this option allows a system manager to have
        more control over which information is provided to remote sites.

    This daemon must be invoked from _ii_nn_ee_tt_dd(1); it cannot be started as a
    service directly.
