    The ssccrriipptt(1) utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your
    terminal. It is useful for users, such as students, who need a hardcopy
    record as proof of an interactive session; the typescript file can be
    printed out later with llpp(1).

    If the argument file is given, ssccrriipptt(1) saves all dialog in file. If no
    file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file ttyyppeessccrriipptt.

    Options are as follows:

    --aa
        Append the output to file or ttyyppeessccrriipptt, retaining the prior contents.
    --FF secs
        Flush stdio buffer to the typescript file every secs seconds. If secs
        is 0, the stdio buffer is flushed with every call to _ww_rr_ii_tt_ee(2); the
        default is to flush every 30 seconds.

    The script ends when the forked shell exits. (To exit sshh(1) in Subsystem for 
	UNIX-based Applications (SUA) systems, use CTRL+D; to exit ccsshh(1), use eexxiitt(1), 
	llooggoouutt(1), or, if ignoreeof is not set, use CTRL+D.)

    Certain interactive commands, such as vvii(1), create garbage in the
    typescript file. The ssccrriipptt(1) utility works best with commands that do
    not manipulate the screen; the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy
    terminal.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    The following environment variable is utilized by ssccrriipptt(1):

    SHELL
        If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by ssccrriipptt(1) will be
        that shell. If SHELL is not set, the Bourne shell is assumed. (Most
        shells set this variable automatically).

    The ssccrriipptt(1) utility places everything in the log file, including
    linefeeds and backspaces. This might not be what an inexperienced user
    expects.
