    The nneewwggrrpp(1) utility changes the shell execution environment to have the
    specified real and effective group. This new shell environment keeps the
    working directory, file creation mask, and exported variables of the
    previous environment. Even if the nneewwggrrpp(1) fails to assign a new group,
    it still creates a new shell environment.

    nneewwggrrpp(1) takes the following options:

    --ll
        Change back to the login environment; that is, the environment the
        user gets when logging in.

    The group is the name or numeric group identifier (ID) of a group in the
    group database. If you do not specify a group, nneewwggrrpp(1) changes the real
    and effective group ID back to your login group.

    If you are not listed as a member of the group and the group requires a
    password, you are prompted to enter the password. If you are listed as a
    member of the group, you are not prompted.

    If it succeeds, the exit status is the exit status of the shell.
    Otherwise, it returns a value >0.

    By default, Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications does not execute files with the set-user-ID (setuid)
    or set-group-ID (setgid) mode bit set for security reasons. If an attempt
    is made to execute such a file, the ENOSETUID error is returned. For more
    information and and instructions for enabling execution of files with
    these mode bits set, see _T_h_e_ _s_u_p_e_r_u_s_e_r_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_ _a_n_d_ _a_p_p_r_o_p_r_i_a_t_e_ _p_r_i_v_i_l_e_g_e_s

    If User Account Control is active, nneewwggrrpp +Administrators
    works in a limited manner. Because of security features of Windows, there 
    is no way for users to get appropriate permissions to change to 
    +Administrators. In this instance, this command cannot change the effective
    group. However, it does create a new shell environment, as described above.
