    The bbaasseennaammee(1) utility treats the string argument as a path name. The
    string is converted to the file name corresponding to the last path-name
    component in string and then the suffix string, if present, is removed.
    The bbaasseennaammee utility does this by performing actions equivalent to the
    following steps in order:

   1.     If string consists entirely of slash (//) characters, string is set
          to a single slash character, and the remaining steps are skipped.
   2.     If there are any trailing slash characters in string, they are
          removed.
   3.     If there are any slash characters remaining in string, the prefix of
          string up to and including the last slash character in string is
          removed.
   4.     If the suffix operand is present, is not identical to the characters
          remaining in string, and is identical to a suffix of the characters
          remaining in string, the suffix string is removed from the end of
          string. Otherwise, string is not modified by this step. It is not
          considered an error if suffix is not found in string.

    The resulting string is written to standard output.

    The bbaasseennaammee(1) utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
