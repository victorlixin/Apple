    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    The sseelleecctt(1) command provides an automatic method of presenting the user
    with a menu and selecting from it.

    The term argument is either a newline or a semicolon (;;). An enumerated
    list of the specified words is printed on standard error, followed by a
    prompt (PS3, normally '##?? '). A number corresponding to one of the
    enumerated words is then read from standard input, name is set to the
    selected word (or is unset if the selection is not valid), REPLY is set to
    what was read (leading/trailing space is stripped), and list is executed.
    If a blank line (that is, zero or more IFS characters) is entered, the
    menu is reprinted without executing list.

    When list completes, the enumerated list is printed if REPLY is null, the
    prompt is printed, and so on. This process is repeated until an end-of-
    file is read, an interrupt is received, or a break statement is executed
    inside the loop.

    If iinn word ...... is omitted, the positional parameters are used (such as
    ""$$11"", ""$$22"").

    For historical reasons, open and close braces can be used instead of ddoo
    and ddoonnee (for example, sseelleecctt ii;; {{ eecchhoo $$ii;; }}).

    The exit status of a sseelleecctt statement is zero if a bbrreeaakk statement is used
    to exit the loop; otherwise, it is non-zero.
