    The ppaasssswwdd(1) utility changes the password for an account. The account
    belongs to the user invoking the utility, or to another user if one is
    specified on the command line.

    The utility prompts for the old password for the account to validate that
    the user has permission to change the password for that account. Then the
    utility prompts for the new password, and prompts for it again. The same
    new password must be entered both times, or the password will not be
    changed. (This protects users from being locked out of their accounts by
    an incorrectly typed password.)

    For security reasons, the old and new passwords are not echoed to the
    screen.

    The ppaasssswwdd(1) utility exits with status 0 if the password was successfully
    changed. If an error occurred, the ppaasssswwdd(1) utility exits with an error
    message and one of these statuses:

    1
        Password not changed

    2
        User could not be validated

    3
        New password not confirmed correctly
