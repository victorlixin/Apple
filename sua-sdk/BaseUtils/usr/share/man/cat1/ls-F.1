    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The llss--FF(1) command lists files like 'ls -F' does, but does so much
    faster. It identifies each type of special file in the listing with a
    special character:

    //
        Directory

    **
        Executable

    ##
        Block device

    %%
        Character device

    ||
        Named pipe (systems with named pipes only)

    ==
        Socket (systems with sockets only)

    @@
        Symbolic link (systems with symbolic links only)

    ++
        Hidden directory (AIX only) or context dependent (HP/UX only)

    ::
        Network special (HP/UX only)

    If the listlinks shell variable is set, symbolic links are identified in
    more detail (on systems which have them):

    @@
        Symbolic link to a nondirectory

    >>
        Symbolic link to a directory

    &&
        Symbolic link to nowhere

    The listlinks shell variable also slows down llss--FF and causes partitions
    holding files pointed to by symbolic links to be mounted.

    If the listflags shell variable is set to 'x', 'a' or 'A', or any
    combination of these (such as 'xA'), they are used as flags to llss--FF,
    making it act like 'ls -xF', 'ls -Fa', 'ls -FA' or a combination (such as
    'ls -FxA'). On computers where 'ls -C' is not the default, llss--FF acts like
    'ls -CF', unless listflags contains an 'x', in which case it acts like 'ls
    -xF'. The llss--FF command passes its arguments to llss(1) if it is given any
    switches, so 'alias ls ls-F' usually behaves correctly. The llss--FF command
    includes file-identification characters when sorting file names; this is a
    bug.
