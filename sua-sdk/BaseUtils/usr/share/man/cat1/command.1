    The ccoommmmaanndd(1) shell built-in executes command_name as if it had been
    given from the command line, with two exceptions. First, command_name
    cannot be a shell function, and second, special built-in commands lose
    their specialness (that is, redirection and utility errors do not cause
    the shell to exit, and command assignments are not permanent). This makes
    ccoommmmaanndd(1) useful for stepping around shell functions that have already
    been defined.

        Use a default search path (the output of getconf CS_PATH) instead of
        the current PATH

        Like --vv, but verbose.

        Instead of executing command_name, display information about the
        command that would be executed. For special and regular built-in
        commands and functions, ccoommmmaanndd(1) prints their names; for aliases, it
        prints the command that defines them, and for commands found by
        searching the PATH parameter, it prints the full path of the command.
        If no command is be found, (that is, the path search fails), nothing
        is printed and ccoommmmaanndd(1) exits with a non-zero status.

    On success, the ccoommmmaanndd(1) built-in utility returns 0. On failure, it
    returns >0.
