    The ttffttppdd(1) utility is a server that supports the Internet Trivial File
    Transfer Protocol (TFTP) (RFC 783). The TFTP server operates at the port
    indicated in the tftp service description. The server is normally started
    by iinneettdd(1).

    The use of ttffttpp(1) does not require an account or password on the remote
    system. Due to the lack of authentication information, ttffttppdd(1) will allow
    only publicly readable files to be accessed. Files containing the string
    "//....//" are not allowed. Files can be written only if they already exist
    and are publicly writable. Note that this extends the concept of public to
    include all users on all hosts that can be reached through the network;
    this might not be appropriate on all systems, and its implications should
    be considered before enabling tftp service. The server should have the
    user identifier (ID) with the lowest possible privilege.

    Access to files can be restricted by invoking ttffttppdd(1) with a list of
    directories and including up to 20 path names as server program arguments
    in //eettcc//iinneettdd..ccoonnff. In this case, access is restricted to files whose
    names are prefixed by the one of the given directories. The given
    directories are also treated as a search path for relative file name
    requests.

    If no list of directories is specified with ttffttpp(1) in the //eettcc//iinneettdd..ccoonnff
    file, all directories are accessible to the remote user. For security
    reasons, it is highly recommended that at least one directory be listed,
    and that the --ll option always.

    The options are:

    --ll
        Logs all requests using _ss_yy_ss_ll_oo_gg(3).

    --nn
        Suppresses negative acknowledgement of requests for nonexistent
        relative file names.
