    The eecchhoo(1) utility prints its arguments on the standard output, separated
    by spaces. The eecchhoo(1) utility treats escape sequences specially, as
    described in the following paragraph.

    If any of the following sequences of characters is encountered during
    output, the sequence is not output. Instead, the specified action is
    performed:

    \\aa
        Output an alert/bell character at this location.

    \\bb
        Output a backspace character.

    \\cc
        Subsequent output is suppressed. This is normally used at the end of
        the last argument to suppress the trailing newline that echo would
        otherwise output.

    \\ff
        Output a form feed.

    \\nn
        Output a newline character.

    \\rr
        Output a carriage return.

    \\tt
        Output a (horizontal) tab character.

    \\vv
        Output a vertical tab.
    \\00ddd
        Output the character whose value is given by zero to three digits. If
        there are zero digits, a NUL character is output.

    \\\\
        Output a backslash.

    The eecchhoo(1) utility is implemented as a shell regular built-in command.

  EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS

    The backslash character (\\) is standard to the shell and must be escaped:

     $$ echo Here is a double backslash: \\\\

    To output a message to standard error, enter

    $$ echo message >&2
