    elvrec - Recover the modified version of a file after an Elvis editor

    If you're editing a file when elvis(1) fails, the system crashes, or power
    fails, the most recent version of your text will be preserved. The
    preserved text is stored in a special directory; it does not overwrite
    your text file automatically.

    The elvrec(1) program searches the temporary directory specified by tmpdir
    to locate the preserved version of the file specified by lostfile, and
    writes it over the top of your text file. The recovered file will have
    nearly all of your changes. If you do not specify the temporary directory,
    eellvvrreecc first looks in the location specified by the TMP environment
    variable. If the TMP environment variable is not defined, then eevvllrreecc
    looks in the location specified by the TEMP environment variable if it is
    defined. If neither TMP nor TEMP is defined, then eellvvrreedd looks in //ttmmpp if
    that directory exists.

        The text that was preserved when elvis(1) died.

    //uussrr//pprreesseerrvvee//IInnddeexx
        A text file which lists the names of all preserved files, and the
        names of the //uussrr//pprreesseerrvvee//pp** files which contain their preserved
        text.

    elvrec(1) makes use of the following environment variables.
    TMP
    TEMP
        Directory for temporary files

    elvrec(1) is very picky about filenames. You must tell it to recover the
    file using exactly the same pathname as when you were editing it. The
    simplest way to do this is to go into the same directory that you were
    editing, and invoke elvrec(1) with the same filename as elvis(1).
