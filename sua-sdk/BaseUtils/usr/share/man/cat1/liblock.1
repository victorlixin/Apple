    The lliibblloocckk(1) utility makes it difficult for users to link against the
    shared object library, lib.so. The lldd(1) command will issue a warning if a
    user attempts to link against a locked library.

    Any user who can write to the library can lock it using lliibblloocckk(1).

    Caution

    *     Once locked, there is no tool to unlock a library.

    The lliibblloocckk(1) utility does not provide strong protection, but it can
    reduce the likelihood of unwanted use.

    The lliibblloocckk(1) utility exits with status 0 for success, and >0 if an error
    occurred.
