    The dduu(1) utility displays the file system block usage for each file
    argument and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each
    directory argument. If no file is specified, the block usage of the
    hierarchy rooted in the current directory is displayed. The number of
    blocks are in the same units as that returned by the _ss_tt_aa_tt(2) call, that
    is, 512-byte blocks, unless the --kk option is given. Partial numbers of
    blocks are rounded up.

    --aa
        Display an entry for each file in the file hierarchy.

    --cc
        Force the display of a cumulative total, regardless of other options.

    --HH
        Follow symbolic links on the command line. Symbolic links encountered
        in the tree traversal are not followed.

    --hh
        Display numbers in a human readable form.  Use unit suffixes:
        Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte in order to reduce
        the number of digits to four or less.  This overrides the --kk option.

    --kk
        Use a block size of 1024-bytes.

    --LL
        All symbolic links are followed.

    --PP
        No symbolic links are followed.
    
    --rr
        Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
        that cannot be opened, and so on.  This is the default case.
        This option exists solely for conformance with SUS.

    --ss
        Display only the grand total for the specified files.

    --xx
        File-system mount points are not traversed.

    The dduu(1) utility counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the
    files they reference unless the --HH or --LL option is specified. If either
    the --HH or --LL options are specified, storage used by any symbolic links
    that are followed is not counted or displayed. The --HH, --LL and --PP options
    override each other, and the command's actions are determined by the last
    one specified.

    Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single time
    per dduu(1) execution.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     BLOCKSIZE  Block counts will be displayed in units of this size block,
                unless the -k or -h option is specified.

    Because file-system mount points are not supported in this version of
    Interix, the --xx behavior is the default.
