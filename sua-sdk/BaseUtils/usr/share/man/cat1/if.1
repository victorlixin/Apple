    This command is a built-in command in the C shell and the Korn shell.

    For the first form, if expr (an expression, as described in the _tt_cc_ss_hh(1)
    section on Expressions) evaluates true, command is executed. Variable
    substitution on command occurs early, at the same time as it does for the
    rest of the iiff command. The command argument must be a simple command, not
    an alias, a pipeline, a command list, or a parenthesized command list. It
    can have arguments. Input/output redirection occurs even if expr is false
    and command is thus not executed; this is a bug.

    For the second form, if the specified expr is true, the commands to the
    first eellssee are executed. Otherwise, if expr2 is true, the commands to the
    second eellssee are executed, and so on. Any number of eellssee--iiff pairs are
    possible; only one eennddiiff is needed. The eellssee part is optional. The words
    eellssee and eennddiiff must appear at the beginning of input lines. The iiff must
    appear alone on its input line or after an eellssee.)

    If the exit status of the first list is zero, the second list is executed;
    otherwise the list following the eelliiff, if any, is executed with similar
    consequences. If all the lists following the iiff and each eelliiff fail (that
    is, exit with non-zero status), the list following the eellssee is executed.
    The exit status of an iiff statement is that of nonconditional list that is
    executed. If no nonconditional list is executed, the exit status is zero.
