    The bbaattcchh(1) command is equivalent to:

    at -q b -m now

    Unlike the default behavior of _aa_tt(1) , you can use bbaattcchh(1) to submit jobs
    for immediate execution, subject to unspecified scheduling delays. It can
    be thought of as the polite way to schedule jobs.

    When bbaattcchh(1) submits a job, it writes to standard output the at_job_id of
    the job and the current date and time. You can use the at_job_id to cancel
    the job (see aatt(1)).

    Because Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications does not yet support load averaging or the job priorities
    through _nn_ii_cc_ee(1) , the queues do not have different priorities.

    When the command has been successfully scheduled, bbaattcchh(1) exits with a 0
    status. Otherwise, it exits with >0.

    By default, Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications does not execute files with the set-user-ID (setuid)
    or set-group-ID (setgid) mode bit set for security reasons. If an attempt
    is made to execute such a file, the ENOSETUID error is returned. For more
    information and and instructions for enabling execution of files with
    these mode bits set, see _T_h_e_ _s_u_p_e_r_u_s_e_r_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_ _a_n_d_ _a_p_p_r_o_p_r_i_a_t_e_ _p_r_i_v_i_l_e_g_e_s
