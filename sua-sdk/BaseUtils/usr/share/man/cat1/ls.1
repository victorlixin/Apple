     For each operand that names a _f_i_l_e of a type other than directory, llss
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each named directory, llss displays the names of files contained within
     that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted sepa-
     rately and in lexicographical order.

     The options are as follows:

     --AA, ----aallmmoosstt--aallll
             List all entries except for ``.'' and ``..''.  Always set for the
             superuser.

     --CC      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
             a terminal.

     --DD, ----ddoommaaiinnnnaammee
             Adds the domain name before user and group names whenever they
             are displayed.

     --FF, ----ccllaassssiiffyy, ----ffiillee--ttyyppee
             Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a
             directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at
             sign (`@') after each symbolic link, a percent sign (`%') after
             each whiteout, an equal sign (`=') after each socket, and a ver-
             tical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.

     --LL, ----ddeerreeffeerreennccee
             If argument is a symbolic link, evaluate the file information and
             file type to be those of the file referenced by the link, and not
             the link itself; however, llss writes the name of the link itself
             and not the file referenced by the link.

     --OO _s_h_o_w_l_i_s_t
             Display only the file types selected in the comma separated list.
             Valid file types that can be displayed are:
                   aaccee      Display files that have additional ACE's beyond
                            POSIX.
                   aallll      Display all file types.
                   bbllkk      Display block special files.
                   cchhaarr     Display character special files.
                   ddiirr      Display directories.
                   ffiiffoo     Display FIFO files.
                   hhaarrdd     Display hard linked files.
                   rr        Display readable files.
                   rreegg      Display regular files.
                   sseett      Display setuid, setgid and setvtx files.
                   ssoocckk     Display socket files.
                   ssyymm      Display symbolic linked files.
                   uunnkknnoowwnn  Display files of an unknown type (not FIFO, regu-
                            lar, block special, socket, symbolic, character
                            special or directory).
                   ww        Display writable files.
                   xx        Display executable files.

     --PP      Print the relative fullpath to the file.

     --RR, ----rreeccuurrssiivvee
             Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     --SS      Sort by size, largest file first.

     --TT, ----ffuullll--ttiimmee
             Display complete time information for the file, including month,
             day, hour, minute, second, and year.  This option has no effect
             unless one of the long format (--ll, --nn) options is also specified.

     --UU      Request that all the files be treated as "unreliable". This may
             help with some filesystem types that do not provide reliable
             inode information.  The default behavior is to assume that a file
             should not be displayed if inode information is not consistent.
             This option allows files in this state to be displayed.

     --WW      Display whiteouts when scanning directories.

     --aa, ----aallll
             Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.').

     --cc      Use time file's status was last changed instead of last modifica-
             tion time for sorting (--tt) or printing (--ll, --nn).

     --dd, ----ddiirreeccttoorryy
             Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively)
             and symbolic links in the argument list are not indirected
             through.

     --ff      Output is not sorted.

     --gg
             Show the group, do not write the owner in the long listing.
             Implies --ll.

     --hh, ----hhuummaann--rreeaaddaabbllee
             When used with a long format option, use unit suffixes: Byte,
             Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte and Exabyte in
             order to reduce the number of digits to four or fewer using pow-
             ers of 2 for sizes (K=1024, M=1048576, etc.).

     --ii, ----iinnooddee
             For each file, print its inode number.

     --kk, ----kkiillbbyytteess
             Modifies the --ss option, causing the sizes to be reported in kilo-
             bytes.  Overrides any value specified by the BLOCKSIZE environ-
             ment variable.

     --ll, ----lloonngg
             (The lowercase letter ``ell.'') List in long format (see below).
             If the output is to a terminal, a total sum of all file sizes is
             output on a line before the long listing.

     --mm      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by
             commas.

     --nn, ----nnuummeerriicc--uuiidd--ggiidd
             List in long format as in --ll, but retain user and group IDs in a
             numeric format.  (--ll, --nn) output.

     --oo, ----nnoo--ggrroouupp
             Show the owner only, do not write the group in the long listing.
             Implies --ll.

     --pp
             Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a
             directory.

     --qq, ----hhiiddee--ccoonnttrrooll--cchhaarrss
             Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the
             character `?'; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     --rr, ----rreevveerrssee
             Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical
             order or the smallest or oldest entries first.

     --ss      Display the number of file system blocks actually used by each
             file, where partial units are rounded up to the next integer
             value.  Blocks are 512 bytes unless overridden by the --kk flag or
             BLOCKSIZE environment variable.

     --tt      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sort-
             ing the operands in lexicographical order.

     --uu      Use file's last access time instead of last modification time for
             sorting (--tt) or printing (--ll, --nn).

     --vv, ----ccoolloouurr, ----ccoolloorr
             Visually identify file types by colouring the names different
             colours.  By default if you are using a colour capabable Subsystem
			 for UNIX-based Applications or xterm terminal the colours are 
			 set using an internal table. You may specifically set the file 
			 type colours for your terminal by setting the environment variable 
			 LS_COLOURS; the default internal tables will not be used. Output 
			 will only be coloured when working with a terminal.

     --xx      Multi-column output sorted across the page rather than down the
             page.

     --11      (The numeric digit ``one.'') Force output to be one entry per
             line.  This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

     The --11, --CC, --ll, and --nn options all override each other; the last one
     specified determines the format used.

     The --cc and --uu options override each other; the last one specified deter-
     mines the file time used.  The --ff option overrides any occurrence of
     either.

     By default, llss lists one entry per line to standard output; the excep-
     tions are to terminals or when the --CC or --mm options are specified.

     File information is displayed with one or more <blank>s separating the
     information associated with the --ii, --ss, --ll, and --nn options.

   TThhee LLoonngg FFoorrmmaatt
     If the --ll or --nn options are given, the following information is displayed
     for each file: mode, number of links, owner, group, size in bytes, time
     of last modification (``mmm dd HH:MM''), and the pathname.  In addition,
     for each directory whose contents are displayed, the first line displayed
     is the total number of blocks used by the files in the directory.  Blocks
     are 512 bytes unless overridden by the --kk option or BLOCKSIZE environment
     variable.

     If the owner or group name is not a known user or group name, respec-
     tively, or the --nn option is given, the numeric ID is displayed.

     If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and
     minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field.

     If the --TT option is given, the time of last modification is displayed
     using the format ``mmm dd HH:MM:SS CCYY''.

     If the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to file is
     preceded by ``->''.

     The file mode printed under the --ll or --nn options consists of the entry
     type, owner permissions, group permissions, and other permissions.  The
     entry type character describes the type of file, as follows:

           bb     block special file
           cc     character special file
           dd     directory
           ll     symbolic link
           ss     socket link
           pp     FIFO
           ww     whiteout
           --     regular file

     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group
     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character posi-
     tions:

           1.   If rr, the file is readable; if --, it is not readable.
           2.   If ww, the file is writable; if --, it is not writable.
           3.   The first of the following that applies:

                      SS   If in the owner permissions, the file is not exe-
                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is not executable and
                            set-group-ID mode is set.

                      ss   If in the owner permissions, the file is exe-
                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is executable and set-
                            group-ID mode is set.

                      xx   The file is executable or the directory is search-
                            able.

                      --   The file is neither readable, writable, exe-
                            cutable, nor set-user-ID, nor set-group-ID, nor
                            sticky (see below).

                These next two apply only to the third character in the last
                group (other permissions):

                      TT   The sticky bit is set (mode 01000), but neither
                            executable nor searchable (see chmod(1)).

                      tt   The sticky bit is set (mode 01000), and is search-
                            able or executable (see chmod(1)).

     As an extension, the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA) version 
	 of llss can also print a plus character (+) after the permissions string. 
	 This indicates that the file has additional entries on its discretionary 
	 access control list that cannot be represented in the traditional format. 
	 You must use a Windows tool (such as File Manager or CACLS.EXE) to display 
	 these entries.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     The llss utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     BLOCKSIZE  If the environment variable BLOCKSIZE is set, and the --kk
                option is not specified, the block counts (see --ss) will be
                displayed in units of that size block.

     COLUMNS    If this variable contains a string representing a decimal
                integer, it is used as the column position width for display-
                ing multiple-text-column output.  The llss utility calculates
                how many pathname text columns to display based on the width
                provided (see --CC).

     LS_COLOURS
                The contents of this variable will set the display colours for
                different file types for the terminal. For compatability
                LS_COLORS will be accepted as an alternative spelling. The
                content is a series of variable settings that are colon (:)
                separated.
                      aallll   for all file types
                      bbllkk   for block special files
                      cchhrr   for character special files
                      ddiirr   for directories
                      eexxee   for executable files
                      ffiiffoo  for FIFO's
                      llnnkk   for linked files
                      mmaattcchh((ppaatttteerrnn))
                            for 'pattern' matching filenames by the rules of
                            glob(3)
                      nnoorrmm  for regular files
                      ssoocckk  for socket files
                      wwhhtt   for whiteout files (not yet on SUA)
                Variables are set equal to a value. You do not specify an
                'escape' as this will be prefixed for you when colouring is
                done. You may leave variables unset. You need to specify the
                unsetting of the color with the same variable name suffixed
                with a "_r". An example setting is:
                     dir=[31m:dir_r=[0m:norm=[0m:lnk=[34m:exe=[32m:all_r=[0m
                The above example is setting foreground colours for an
                "interix" terminal.  You may also set background colours
                instead or in combination with the foreground colour. With an
                "interix" terminal setting the foreground to blue and back-
                ground to grey would be the sequence "[34;47m" provided to one
                of the setting listed above. The sequence may/can/will be dif-
                ferent for different terminal types.
                An example of using "match" to pattern match for files ending
                is ".foo" is "match(*.foo)=[34m". Allowable pattern matches
                are as described with the glob(3) manual page as called from
                the function fnmatch(3).
                It is always good practice for the setting "all_r" be used as
                a "catch all" to revert back to normal colours. For the
                interix terminal this is "[0m".  You are not restricted to
                just colour sequences -- any terminal sequence can be used
                such alert (control G).

     TZ         The timezone to use when displaying dates.
