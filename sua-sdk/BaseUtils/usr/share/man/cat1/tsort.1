    The ttssoorrtt(1) utility takes a list of pairs of node names representing
    directed arcs in a graph and prints the nodes in topological order on
    standard output. Input is taken from the named file, or from standard
    input if no file is given.

    Node names in the input are separated by white space and there must be an
    even number of node pairs.

    The presence of a node in a graph can be represented by an arc from the
    node to itself. This is useful when a node is not connected to any other
    nodes.

    If the graph contains a cycle (and therefore cannot be properly sorted),
    one of the arcs in the cycle is ignored and the sort continues. Cycles are
    reported on standard error.

    The options are as follows:

    --ll
        Search for and display the longest cycle. Can take a very long time.

    failure.
