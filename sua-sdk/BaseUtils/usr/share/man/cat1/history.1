    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The first form prints the history event list.If n is given, only the n
    most recent events are printed or saved. With --hh, the history list is
    printed without leading numbers and timestamps in comment form. (This can
    be used to produce files suitable for loading with 'history -L' or 'source
    -h'.) With --rr, the order of printing is most recent first rather than
    oldest first.

    With --SS, the second form saves the history list to filename. If the first
    word of the savehist shell variable is set to a number, that is the
    maximum number of lines saved. If the second word of savehist is set to
    'merge', the history list is merged with the existing history file instead
    of replacing it (if there is one) and sorted by timestamp. Merging is
    intended for an environment like the X Window System with several shells
    in simultaneous use. Currently, it only succeeds when the shells quit one
    after another.

    With --LL, the shell appends filename, which is presumably a history list
    saved by the --SS option or the savehist mechanism, to the history list. --
    MM is like --LL, but the contents of filename are merged into the history
    list and sorted by timestamp. In either case, histfile is used if filename
    is not given and ~~//..hhiissttoorryy is used if histfile is unset. 'history -L' is
    exactly like 'source -h' except that it does not require a file name.

    Note that login shells do the equivalent of 'history -L' on startup and,
    if savehist is set, 'history -S' before exiting. Because only ~~//..ttccsshhrrcc is
    normally sourced before ~~//..hhiissttoorryy, histfile should be set in ~~//..ttccsshhrrcc
    rather than ~~//..llooggiinn.

    If histlit is set, the first and second forms print and save the literal
    (unexpanded) form of the history list.

    The last form clears the history list.
