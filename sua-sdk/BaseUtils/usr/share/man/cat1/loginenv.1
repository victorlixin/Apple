    The llooggiinneennvv(1) utility creates a new login shell with the user's original
    login environment and the user's login directory. It also logs an entry in
    the _uu_tt_mm_pp(5) file.

    The llooggiinneennvv(1) utility takes the following options and operands:

    --pp
        Preserves the user's existing environment and current working
        directory instead of providing the user's default login environment
        and directory. If this option is not specified, the new environment is
        created using system global values and user-specific values stored in
        the Windows registry. In addition, if this option is not specified,
        the following variables are set to the value from the user's
        _gg_ee_tt_pp_ww_ee_nn_tt(2) structure. These environment variables will replace any
        settings found in the global environment settings:
        *     HOME
        *     PATH (set to the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA) 
		default value, which can viewed using ggeettccoonnff CCSS__PPAATTHH)
        *     SHELL
        *     LOGNAME (if --ll option is not specified)
        *     USER (if --ll option is not specified)
    --ll username
        Sets the LOGNAME environment variable to username instead of the user
        name of the logged-on user.
    --hh hostname
        Specifies the name of the host stored in the uuttmmpp(5) file.
    --cc cmd
        Specifies the full path of a command to be executed instead of the
        user's default login shell.

    arg
        Specifies an argument to be passed to cmd. Note that if arg is
        present, cmd must be specified twice. For example, to list the //ttmmpp
        directory, use llooggiinneennvv --cc //bbiinn//llss //bbiinn//llss //ttmmpp.

    4
        Not enough memory was available to store the user's environment.

    5
        The attempt to change the current working directory failed.

    6
        If --cc is specified, _ee_xx_ee_cc(2) failed to execute cmd; otherwise, eexxeecc(2)
        failed to execute the login shell.
