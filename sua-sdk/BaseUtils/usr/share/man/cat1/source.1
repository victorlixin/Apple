    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The shell reads and executes commands from name. The commands are not
    placed on the history list. If arguments (arg) are given, they are placed
    in argv. You can nest ssoouurrccee commands; if they are nested too deeply,
    however, the shell might run out of file descriptors. An error in a ssoouurrccee
    at any level terminates all nested ssoouurrccee commands. With --hh, commands are
    placed on the history list instead of being executed, much like hhiissttoorryy --
    LL.
