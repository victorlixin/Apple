    The ppoodd22mmaann(1) utility converts its input file containing embedded pod
    directives (see ppeerrllppoodd) into nroff source suitable for viewing with nnrrooffff
    or ttrrooffff using the man macro set.

    In addition to the obvious pod conversions, ppoodd22mmaann(1) also handles
    func(), func(n), and simple variable references like $cat or @dog so you
    need not use code escapes for them. Complex expressions like
    $fred{'stuff'}, however, still must be escaped.

    Other things that it does include translating the minus in something like
    cat-dog, making a long dash--like this--into a real em dash (--),
    fixing up "paired quotes," putting a small space after the parentheses in
    something like func(), making C++ and pi look correct, placing a very
    small space between double underlines, making ALLCAPS somewhat smaller in
    ttrrooffff, and escaping backslashes, which alleviates the need for you to do
    so.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    cceenntteerr
        Set the centered header to a specific string. The default is "User
        Contributed Perl Documentation", unless the ----ooffffiicciiaall flag is given,
        in which case the default is "Perl Programmers Reference Guide."

    ddaattee
        Set the left-hand footer string to this value. By default, the
        modification date of the input file is used.

    ffiixxeedd
        The fixed font to use for code refs. Defaults to CW.

    ooffffiicciiaall
        Set the default header to indicate that this page is of the standard
        release if ----cceenntteerr is not given.

    rreelleeaassee
        Set the centered footer. By default, this is the current perl release.

    sseeccttiioonn
        Set the section for the .TH macro. The standard conventions on
        sections are to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
        functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
        miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands. This
        works best if you put your perl man pages in a separate tree, like //
        uussrr//llooccaall//ppeerrll//mmaann//. By default, section 1 will be used unless the
        file ends in .pm, in which case section 3 will be selected.

    llaaxx
        Do not complain when required sections are not present.

    This section describes the general structure and layout of a proper manual
    page. Major headers should be set out as a =head1 directive, and are
    historically written in the ALL UPPERCASE format, although this is not
    mandatory. Minor headers use =head2, and are typically mixed case.

    NAME
        Mandatory section; should be a comma-separated list of programs or
        functions documented by this podpage, such as:
        cat, dog - programs to do something

    SYNOPSIS
        A short usage summary for programs and functions; might someday be
        deemed mandatory.

    DESCRIPTION
        Long discussion of the program. It is advisable to break this up into
        subsections using the =head2 directives, as shown in the following
        example:
        =head2 A Sample Subsection
        =head2 Yet Another Sample Subsection

    OPTIONS
        Some people make this separate from the description.

    RETURN VALUE
        What the program or function returns if successful.

    ERRORS
        Exceptions, return codes, exit stati, and errno settings.

    EXAMPLES
        Give some examples of how the program is used.

    ENVIRONMENT
        Environment variables this program might use.

    FILES
        All files used by the program. You should probably use the F<> for
        these.

    SEE ALSO
        Other relevant man pages. For example:
        _mm_aa_nn(1)

    NOTES
        Additional commentary.

    CAVEATS
        Things that require special attention; sometimes called WARNINGS.

    DIAGNOSTICS
        All possible messages the program can print out, and what those
        messages mean.

    BUGS
        Things that either do not work, or do not work correctly.

    RESTRICTIONS
        Bugs you do not plan to fix.

    AUTHOR
        The person who wrote it (AUTHORS if multiple).

    HISTORY
        Programs derived from other sources sometimes include this;
        alternatively, you might keep a modification log in this section.

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    The following diagnostics are generated by ppoodd22mmaann(1). Items marked (W)
    are non-fatal; (F) errors, however, will cause ppoodd22mmaann(1) to exit
    immediately with a non-zero status.

    Bad option in paragraph %d of %s: "%s" should be [%s]<%s>
        (W) If you start include an option, you should set it off as bold,
        italic, or code.

    Cannot open %s: %s
        (F) The input file was not available for the given reason.

    Improper man page - no dash in NAME header in paragraph %d of %s
        (W) The NAME header did not include an isolated dash; this is
        considered important.

    Invalid man page - no NAME line in %s
        (F) You did not include a NAME header, which is essential.

    The roff font should be 1 or 2 chars, not %s
        (F) The font specified with the ----ffiixxeedd option was not a one- or two-
        digit roff font.

    The %s is missing required section: %s
        (W) Required sections include NAME, DESCRIPTION, and, if you are using
        a section starting with a 3, a SYNOPSIS. Not including a NAME is
        fatal.

    Unknown escape: %s in %s
        (W) An unknown HTML entity (probably for an eight-bit character) was
        given using an E<> directive.
        Besides amp, lt, gt, and quot, recognized entities are as follows:
        Aacute, aacute, Acirc, acirc, AElig, aelig, Agrave, agrave, Aring,
        aring, Atilde, atilde, Auml, auml, Ccedil, ccedil, Eacute, eacute,
        Ecirc, ecirc, Egrave, egrave, ETH, eth, Euml, euml, Iacute, iacute,
        Icirc, icirc, Igrave, igrave, Iuml, iuml, Ntilde, ntilde, Oacute,
        oacute, Ocirc, ocirc, Ograve, ograve, Oslash, oslash, Otilde, otilde,
        Ouml, ouml, szlig, THORN, thorn, Uacute, uacute, Ucirc, ucirc, Ugrave,
        ugrave, Uuml, uuml, Yacute, yacute, and yuml.

    Unmatched =back
        (W) You have a =back without a corresponding =over.

    Unrecognized pod directive: %s
        (W) You specified a pod directive that is not in the known list that
        includes =head1, =head2, =item, =over, =back, or =cut.

  NNOOTTEESS

    If you want to print out a large amount of man page continuously, set the
    C and D registers to set contiguous page numbering and even/odd paging, at
    least on some versions of mmaann(1). Setting the F register will provide you
    with some additional experimental indexing:

    ttrrooffff --mmaann --rrCC11 --rrDD11 --rrFF11 ppeerrll..11 ppeerrllddaattaa..11 ppeerrllssyynn..11 ......

    The indexing merely outputs messages through .tm for each major page,
    section, subsection, item, and any X<> directives.

  RREESSTTRRIICCTTIIOONNSS

    None at this time.

  BBUUGGSS

    The =over and =back directives do not work correctly. They take absolute
    positions instead of offsets and nest poorly. In addition, requiring
    people to count is suboptimal.

  AAUUTTHHOORRSS

    Original prototype by Larry Wall, but so massively hacked over by Tom
    Christiansen such that Larry probably doesn't recognize it anymore.
