    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    The ttrraapp(1) command sets a trap handler that is to be executed when any of
    the specified signals are received. The handler argument is either a null
    string, indicating the signals are to be ignored; a minus (--), indicating
    that the default action is to be taken for the signals (see _s_i_g_n_a_l(2)); or
    a string containing shell commands to be evaluated and executed at the
    first opportunity (that is, when the current command completes, or before
    printing the next PS1 prompt) after receipt of one of the signals. The
    signal argument is the name of a signal (for example, PIPE or ALRM) or the
    number of the signal (see the _kk_ii_ll_ll_ _--_ll command). There are two special
    signals: EXIT (also known as 00), which is executed when the shell is about
    to exit, and ERR which is executed after an error occurs (an error is
    something that would cause the shell to exit if the --ee or eerrrreexxiitt option
    were set -- see _ss_ee_tt(1) command). EXIT handlers are executed in the
    environment of the last executed command. Note that for noninteractive
    shells, the trap handler cannot be changed for signals that were ignored
    when the shell started.

    With no arguments, ttrraapp lists, as a series of ttrraapp commands, the current
    state of the traps that have been set since the shell started.

    The original Korn shell's DDEEBBUUGG trap and the handling of ERR and EXIT
    traps in functions are not yet implemented.
