    The sspplliitt(1) utility reads the given file (or standard input if no file is
    specified) and breaks it up into files of 1000 lines each.

    The options are as follows:

    --aa
        Defines suffix length suffix_length for the output files. The default
        is two.

    --bb
        Create smaller files byte_count bytes in length. If kk is appended to
        the number, the file is split into byte_count kilobyte pieces. If mm is
        appended to the number, the file is split into byte_count megabyte
        pieces.

    --ll
        Create smaller files n lines in length.

    --pp
        The file is split whenever an input line matches ppaatttteerrnn, which
        is interpreted as an extended regular expression.  The matching
        line will be the first line of the next output file.  This option
        is incompatible with the --bb and --ll options.

    If additional arguments are specified, the first is used as the name of
    the input file that is to be split. If a second additional argument is
    specified, it is used as a prefix for the names of the files into which
    the file is split. In this case, each file into which the file is split is
    named by the prefix followed by a lexically ordered suffix in the range of
    aa-zz.

    If the name argument is not specified, the file is split into lexically
    ordered files named in the range of xaa-xzz.

  BBUUGGSS

    For historical reasons, if you specify name, sspplliitt(1) can only create 676
    separate files. The default naming convention allows 2028 separate files.
