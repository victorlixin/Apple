    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The nnoottiiffyy(1) command causes the shell to notify the user asynchronously
    when the status of any of the specified jobs (or, without %job, the
    current job) changes, instead of waiting until the next prompt, as it
    usually does. The job argument can be a number, a string, "", %%, ++, or --
    , as described in "Jobs" in _tt_cc_ss_hh(1). See also the notify shell variable in
    _tt_cc_ss_hh(1) .
