    The rrppcciinnffoo(1) utility makes a remote procedure call (RPC) to an RPC
    server and reports what it finds.

    --pp
        Probe the port mapper on host, and print a list of all registered RPC
        programs. If host is not specified, it defaults to the value returned
        by hhoossttnnaammee(1).

    --uu
        Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of program on the specified host using
        User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and report whether a response was
        received.

    --tt
        Make an RPC call to procedure 0 of program on the specified host using
        transmission control protocol (TCP), and report whether a response was
        received.
    --nn portnum
        Use portnum as the port number for the --tt and --uu options instead of
        the port number given by the port mapper.

    --bb
        Make an RPC broadcast to procedure 0 of the specified program and
        version using UDP, and report all hosts that respond. The version
        number is required for this option.

    --dd
        Delete registration for the RPC service of the specified program and
        version. The version number is required for this option.

    The program argument can be either a name or a number.

    If a version is specified, rrppcciinnffoo(1) attempts to call that version of the
    specified program. Otherwise, rrppcciinnffoo(1) attempts to find all the
    registered version numbers for the specified program by calling version 0
    (which is presumed not to exist; if it does exist, rrppcciinnffoo(1) attempts to
    obtain this information by calling an extremely high version number
    instead) and attempts to call each registered version. The version number
    is required for --bb and --dd options.

    To show all of the RPC services registered on the local machine use:

    $$ rpcinfo -p

    To show all of the RPC services registered on the computer named kkllaaxxoonn
    use:

    $$ rpcinfo -p klaxon

    To show all computers on the local net that are running the Yellow Pages
    service use:

    $$ rpcinfo -b ypserv 'version' | uniq

    where 'version' is the current Yellow Pages version obtained from the
    results of the --pp switch above.

    To delete the registration for version 1 of the wwaalllldd service use:

    $$ rpcinfo -d walld 1
