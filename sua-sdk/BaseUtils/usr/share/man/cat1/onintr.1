    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The oonniinnttrr(1) command controls the action of the shell on interrupts.
    Without arguments, it restores the default action of the shell on
    interrupts, which is to terminate shell scripts or to return to the
    terminal command input level. With a hyphen (--), it causes all interrupts
    to be ignored. With label, it causes the shell to execute a "goto llaabbeell"
    when an interrupt is received or a child process terminates because it was
    interrupted.

    The oonniinnttrr command is ignored if the shell is running detached and in
    system startup files (see FILES in _tt_cc_ss_hh(1) ), where interrupts are
    disabled anyway.
