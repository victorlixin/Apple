    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The first form prints the directory stack. The top of the stack is at the
    left and the first directory in the stack is the current directory. With --
    ll, '~' or '~name' in the output, is expanded explicitly to home path name
    of the home directory for user name. With --nn, entries are wrapped before
    they reach the edge of the screen. With --vv, entries are printed one per
    line, preceded by their stack positions. If more than one of --nn or --vv is
    given, --vv takes precedence. --pp is accepted but does nothing.

    With --SS, the second form saves the directory stack to filename as a series
    of _cc_dd(1) and _pp_uu_ss_hh_dd(1) commands. With --LL, the shell sources filename, which
    is presumably a directory-stack file saved by the --SS option or the
    savedirs mechanism. In either case, dirsfile is used if filename is not
    given and ~~//..ccsshhddiirrss is used if dirsfile is unset.

    Note that login shells do the equivalent of 'dirs -L' on startup and, if
    savedirs is set, 'dirs -S' before exiting. Because only ~~//..ttccsshhrrcc is
    normally sourced before ~~//..ccsshhddiirrss, dirsfile should be set in ~~//..ttccsshhrrcc
    rather than ~~//..llooggiinn.

    The last form clears the directory stack.
