  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The mmoorree(1) utility is a filter for paging through text, one screen at a
    time. It uses tteerrmmccaapp(5) so it can run on a variety of terminals. There is
    even limited support for hardcopy terminals. (On a hardcopy terminal,
    lines that should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with an
    up-arrow.) If file is a single hyphen (--), mmoorree(1) reads standard input
    (though it will not take input from a terminal).

    Command-line options are described in the following list. Options are also
    taken from the environment variable MORE, but command-line options will
    override options taken from MORE. Be sure to precede options with a dash
    (--) in the MORE variable.

    --cc
        Normally, mmoorree(1) will repaint the screen by scrolling from the bottom
        of the screen. If the --cc option is set, when mmoorree(1) needs to change
        the entire display, it will paint from the top line down.

    --ee
        When standard output is a terminal, mmoorree(1) normally prompts the user,
        indicating end-of-file, when it reaches the end of the last argument,
        and waits. When --ee is specified, mmoorree(1) exits as soon as it writes
        the last line of the last file.

    --ii
        The --ii option causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and
        lowercase are considered identical.
    --nn number
        Display number lines per screen. This overrides any value taken from
        the environment.
    --pp command
        For each file, execute the mmoorree(1) command given as command when first
        displaying the file.
    --PP str
        Set the paging prompt to str followed by the position in the file
        expressed as a percentage.

    --ss
        The --ss option causes consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into a
        single blank line.

    --tt
        The --tt option, followed immediately by a tag, will edit the file
        containing that tag. For more information, see the ccttaaggss(1) command.

    --uu
        By default, mmoorree(1) treats backspaces and CR-LF sequences specially.
        Backspaces that appear adjacent to an underscore character are
        displayed as underlined text. Backspaces that appear between two
        identical characters are displayed as bold text. CR-LF sequences are
        compressed to a single line-feed character. The --uu option causes
        backspaces to always be displayed as control characters; that is, as
        the two-character sequence "^H", and CR-LF to be left alone.
    --xx N
        The --xx option sets tab stops every N positions. The default for N is
        eight.
    --//pattern
        The --// option specifies a string that will be searched for before each
        file is displayed.

  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS

    Interactive commands for mmoorree(1) are based on vvii(1). Some commands can be
    preceded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below. In the
    following descriptions, ^^XX means CTRL+X.

    hh
        Help: display a summary of these commands. This can be a very useful
        command.
    <SPACE>, ff, or ^^FF
        Scroll forward N lines, default is one window. If N is more than the
        screen size, only the final screen is displayed.
    bb or ^^BB
        Scroll backward N lines, default is one window (see option --zz below).
        If N is more than the screen size, only the final screen is displayed.
    jj or <RETURN>
        Scroll forward N lines, default is 1. The entire N lines are
        displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.

    kk
        Scroll backward N lines, default is 1. The entire N lines are
        displayed, even if N is more than the screen size.
    dd or ^^DD
        Scroll forward N lines, default is one half of the screen size. If N
        is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent dd and uu
        commands.
    uu or ^^UU
        Scroll backward N lines, default is one half of the screen size. If N
        is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent dd and uu
        commands.

    gg
        Go to line N in the file, default is 1 (beginning of file).

    GG
        Go to line N in the file, default is the end of the file.
    pp or %%
        Go to a position N percent into the file. The percent N should be
        between 0 and 100. (This works if standard input is being read, but
        only if mmoorree(1) has already read to the end of the file. It is always
        fast, but not always useful.)
    rr or ^^LL
        Repaint the screen.

    RR
        Repaint the screen, discarding any buffered input. Useful if the file
        is changing while it is being viewed.
    mmc
        Followed by any lowercase letter, c, marks the current position with
        that letter.
    ''c
        (Single quote.) Followed by any lowercase letter, returns to the
        position that was previously marked with that letter. Followed by
        another single quote, returns to the position at which the last
        "large" movement command was executed, or the beginning of the file if
        no such movements have occurred. All marks are lost when a new file is
        examined.
    //pattern
        Search forward in the file for the instance of the line, specified by
        N, containing the pattern. N defaults to 1. The pattern is a regular
        expression, as recognized by eedd(1). The search starts at the second
        line displayed.
    ??pattern
        Search backward in the file for the instance of the line, specified by
        N, containing the pattern. The search starts at the line immediately
        before the top line displayed.
    //!! pattern
        Like //, but the search is for the instance of the line, indicated by
        N, that does not contain the pattern.
    ??!!pattern
        Like ??, but the search is for the instance of the line, specified by
        N, that does not contain the pattern.

    nn
        Repeat previous search, for the instance of the line, indicated by N,
        containing the last pattern (or not containing the last pattern, if
        the previous search was //!! or ??!!).
    EE[filename]
        Examine a new file. If the file name is missing, the "current" file
        (see the N and PP commands below), from the list of files in the
        command line, is re-examined. If the file name is a pound sign (##),
        the previously examined file is re-examined.
    NN or ::nn
        Examine the next file (from the list of files given in the command
        line). If a number N is specified (not to be confused with the command
        NN), the next instance of the file, specified by N, is examined.
    PP or ::pp
        Examine the previous file. If a number N is specified, the previous
        instance of the file, specified by N, is examined.
    ::tt tag
        Go to supplied tag.

    vv
        Invokes an editor to edit the current file being viewed. The editor is
        taken from the environment variable EDITOR, or defaults to vvii(1).
    == or ^^GG
        These options print out the number of the file currently being
        displayed relative to: the total number of files there are to display,
        the current line number, the current byte number and the total bytes
        to display, and what percentage of the file has been displayed. If
        mmoorree(1) is reading from stdin, or the file is shorter than a single
        screen, some of these items might not be available. Note that all of
        these items reference the first byte of the last line displayed on the
        screen.
    qq or ::qq or ZZZZ
        Exits mmoorree(1).

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    The mmoorree(1) utility uses the following environment variables, if they are
    set:

    MORE
        This variable can be set with favored options to mmoorree(1).

    EDITOR
        Specify default editor.

    SHELL
        Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login time).

    TERM
        Specifies terminal type, used by mmoorree to get the terminal
        characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen.
