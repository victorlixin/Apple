    The llooggiinn(1) utility logs users on the computer system.

    If no user is specified, or if a user is specified and authentication of
    the user fails, llooggiinn(1) prompts for a user name. Authentication of users
    is done through passwords.

    On Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, the llooggiinn(1) program displays 
    a domain name in parentheses. If the user does not specify a domain name as part of
    the user name, the user is assumed to be in the displayed domain. This default domain
    is derived from the system registry (see NOTES later in this topic). If no registry
    entry exists, the result is taken from a call to 
    _gg_ee_tt_pp_dd_oo_mm_aa_ii_nn(2).

    The llooggiinn(1) utility takes the following options:
    --dd domain
        Use the specified domain name instead of the default.

    --ff
        Force login without a password; it indicates that the proper
        authentication has already been done and no password need be
        requested. This can only be used when an already logged-in user is
        logging in as himself or herself.
    --hh hostname
        Specifies that the connection was received from hostname. This option
        is used by various daemons, and requires appropriate privileges.

    --II
        Before prompting for user, llooggiinn(1) prints information about the
        domain+username format. If a user is supplied on the command line,
        llooggiinn(1) prints this information only if the password is wrong.

    --pp
        Preserve the environment. By default, llooggiinn(1) discards the previous
        environment.

    --qq
        Suppress certain messages, just as if the file ..hhuusshhllooggiinn had been
        found in the user's home directory.

    If the file //eettcc//nnoollooggiinn exists, the content of the file is printed and
    the process exits, preventing login.

    Normally, the llooggiinn(1) utility prints the system copyright notice and
    notifies the user of new mail, and indicates whether either the account or
    the password will expire in the next two days. If the file ..hhuusshhllooggiinn
    exists in the user's home directory, these messages are not displayed.

    The llooggiinn(1) utility enters information into the environment specifying
    the user's home directory (HOME), command interpreter (SHELL), search path
    (PATH), terminal type (TERM) and user name (both LOGNAME and USER).

    The standard shells, ccsshh(1) and sshh(1), contain a special built-in command
    and an alias, respectively, for llooggiinn. If you invoke llooggiinn in this manner,
    the shells do not fork before executing the llooggiinn(1) utility.

  FFIILLEESS

    The following files are used by llooggiinn(1):

    //eettcc//nnoollooggiinn
        If this file exists, llooggiinn(1) prints the content of the file and the
        process exits.

    $$HHOOMMEE//..hhuusshhllooggiinn
        If this file exists, a "quiet" login is performed (this disables the
        checking of mail and the printing of the last login time and message
        of the day).

  NNOOTTEESS

    The default domain presented in the login banner can be changed by setting
    the Windows registry variable
    HHKKEEYY__LLOOCCAALL__MMAACCHHIINNEE\\SSOOFFTTWWAARREE\\MMiiccrroossoofftt\\SSUUAA
	\\PPrriinncciippaallDDoommaaiinn.
    Set the value of the PPrriinncciippaallDDoommaaiinn entry to the name of the domain.

    Caution

    *     Incorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your system.
          Before making changes to the registry, you should back up any valued
          data on the computer.
