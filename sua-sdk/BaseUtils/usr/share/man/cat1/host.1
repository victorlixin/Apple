       hhoosstt is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is
       normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice
       versa. When no arguments or options are given, hhoosstt prints
       a short summary of its command line arguments and options.

       _n_a_m_e is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can
       also be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited
       IPv6 address, in which case hhoosstt will by default perform a
       reverse lookup for that address.  _s_e_r_v_e_r is an optional
       argument which is either the name or IP address of the
       name server that hhoosstt should query instead of the server
       or servers listed in _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f.

       The --aa (all) option is equivalent to setting the --vv option
       and asking hhoosstt to make a query of type ANY.

       When the --CC option is used, hhoosstt will attempt to display
       the SOA records for zone _n_a_m_e from all the listed
       authoritative name servers for that zone. The list of name
       servers is defined by the NS records that are found for
       the zone.

       The --cc option instructs to make a DNS query of class
       _c_l_a_s_s. This can be used to lookup Hesiod or Chaosnet class
       resource records. The default class is IN (Internet).

       Verbose output is generated by hhoosstt when the --dd or --vv
       option is used. The two options are equivalent. They have
       been provided for backwards compatibility. In previous
       versions, the --dd option switched on debugging traces and
       --vv enabled verbose output.

       List mode is selected by the --ll option. This makes hhoosstt
       perform a zone transfer for zone _n_a_m_e. Transfer the zone
       printing out the NS, PTR and address records (A/AAAA). If
       combined with --aa all records will be printed.

       The --ii option specifies that reverse lookups of IPv6
       addresses should use the IP6.INT domain as defined in
       RFC1886. The default is to use IP6.ARPA.

       The --NN option sets the number of dots that have to be in
       _n_a_m_e for it to be considered absolute. The default value
       is that defined using the ndots statement in
       _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f, or 1 if no ndots statement is present.
       Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names
       and will be searched for in the domains listed in the
       sseeaarrcchh or ddoommaaiinn directive in _/_e_t_c_/_r_e_s_o_l_v_._c_o_n_f.

       The number of UDP retries for a lookup can be changed with
       the --RR option.  _n_u_m_b_e_r indicates how many times hhoosstt will
       repeat a query that does not get answered. The default
       number of retries is 1. If _n_u_m_b_e_r is negative or zero, the
       number of retries will default to 1.

       Non-recursive queries can be made via the --rr option.
       Setting this option clears the RRDD -- recursion desired --
       bit in the query which hhoosstt makes. This should mean that
       the name server receiving the query will not attempt to
       resolve _n_a_m_e. The --rr option enables hhoosstt to mimic the
       behaviour of a name server by making non-recursive queries
       and expecting to receive answers to those queries that are
       usually referrals to other name servers.

       By default hhoosstt uses UDP when making queries. The --TT
       option makes it use a TCP connection when querying the
       name server. TCP will be automatically selected for
       queries that require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR)
       requests.

       The --44 option forces hhoosstt to only use IPv4 query
       transport. The --66 option forces hhoosstt to only use IPv6
       query transport.

       The --tt option is used to select the query type.  _t_y_p_e can
       be any recognised query type: CNAME, NS, SOA, SIG, KEY,
       AXFR, etc. When no query type is specified, hhoosstt
       automatically selects an appropriate query type. By
       default it looks for A records, but if the --CC option was
       given, queries will be made for SOA records, and if _n_a_m_e
       is a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or colon-delimited IPv6
       address, hhoosstt will query for PTR records. If a query type
       of IXFR is chosen the starting serial number can be
       specified by appending an equal followed by the starting
       serial number (e.g. -t IXFR=12345678).

       The time to wait for a reply can be controlled through the
       --WW and --ww options. The --WW option makes hhoosstt wait for _w_a_i_t
       seconds. If _w_a_i_t is less than one, the wait interval is
       set to one second. When the --ww option is used, hhoosstt will
       effectively wait forever for a reply. The time to wait for
       a response will be set to the number of seconds given by
       the hardware's maximum value for an integer quantity.
