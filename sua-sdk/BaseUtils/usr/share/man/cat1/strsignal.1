    The ssttrrssiiggnnaall(1) utility writes the textual description of the signal
    number as specified by the signo operand to standard output.

    The options are as follows:

    --ll
        List all signals to standard-output.

    --mm
        Write the mapping of POSIX.2 signal numbers to Windows-recognized
        signals.

    --ww
        Suppress writing the warning message about signal number mapping on
        Windows when performing a list operation.

    --xx
        Write an explanation of the command to standard-error.

    Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications (SUA) maps signals the same as most 
	traditional systems, but there are areas where different historical 
	behaviors are incompatible. POSIX.2 mandates that certain historical 
	numbers be recognized by the kkiillll(1) command. Issuing a kkiillll --99 
	will send a SIGKILL to the receiving process, regardless of the actual 
	value of the SIGKILL macro. Use signal names for clarity.
