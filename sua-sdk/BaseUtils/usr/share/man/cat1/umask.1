    The uummaasskk(1) command sets or reports the file mode creation mask for the
    current shell execution environment. The file mode creation mask is used
    to determine the initial value of a file's permissions when it is created.

    The following option is available:

    --SS
        Report the file mode creation mask symbolically. If --SS is not used,
        the output format is unspecified.

    The output format for --SS is:

    "u=%s,g=%s,o=%s\n", owner perms, group perms, other perms

    The mask argument can be specified as either a symbolic mode, or
    (obsolescent) octal number. See the discussion of modes in the cchhmmoodd(1)
    reference page. The file mode creation mask of the shell execution
    environment will be set according to the mask argument. For a symbolic
    mode value, the new value of the file mode creation mask will be the
    logical complement of the file permissions portion of the file mode
    specified as a symbolic mode.

    The output from an invocation of uummaasskk(1) without a mask argument can be
    used as input to another invocation of uummaasskk(1).

    If the mask argument is not given, uummaasskk(1) writes the value of the
    current file mode creation mask to standard output.

    To clear all write bits, you must use uummaasskk ---- --ww.
