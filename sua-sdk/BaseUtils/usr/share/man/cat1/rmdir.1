    The rrmmddiirr(1) utility removes the directory entry specified by each
    directory argument, provided it is empty.

    Arguments are processed in the order given. In order to remove both a
    parent directory and a subdirectory of that parent, the subdirectory must
    be specified first so the parent directory is empty when rrmmddiirr(1) tries to
    remove it.

    The options are as follows:

    --pp
        Each directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all
        components will be removed, if they are empty, starting with the last
        most component. (See _r_m(1) for fully non-discriminant recursive
        removal.)

    The rrmmddiirr(1) utility exits with one of the following values:

    0
        Each directory entry specified by a dir operand referred to an empty
        directory and was removed successfully.

    >0
        An error occurred.
