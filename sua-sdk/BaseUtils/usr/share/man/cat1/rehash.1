    This command is a C-shell built-in command.

    The rreehhaasshh(1) command causes the internal hash table of the contents of
    the directories in the path variable to be recomputed. This is needed if
    new commands are added to directories in path while you are logged on.
    This should only be necessary if you add commands to one of your own
    directories, or if a systems programmer changes the contents of one of the
    system directories. The rreehhaasshh command also flushes the cache of home
    directories built by tilde (~~)expansion.
