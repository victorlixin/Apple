    The ccdd command is a built-in command in the C Shell and the Korn Shell.
    The cchhddiirr command is a built-in command in the C shell and is a synonym
    for ccdd.

    The ccdd(1) command sets the current working directory to directory.

    If no directory is specified, ccdd(1) changes to the HOME directory. When
    the shell successfully changes directories, it stores the name of the old
    directory in a variable (OLDPWD for kksshh(1), oowwdd in ttccsshh(1)). The command:

    cd -

    changes back to the previous directory.

    If the specified directory does not begin with a slash (/) and is not a
    subdirectory of the current directory, the shell searches through a list
    of directories for the specified directory. In the Korn shell (kksshh(1)),
    the list of directories is stored in the variable CDPATH; if the variable
    is unset or is null, only the current directory is searched. (In the C
    shell, see the cdpath variable.)

    The ccdd(1) command supports additional options, depending on the shell. For
    more information, see _k_s_h(1) and _t_c_s_h(1).
