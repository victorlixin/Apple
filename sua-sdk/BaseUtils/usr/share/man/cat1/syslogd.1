    The ssyyssllooggdd(1) utility reads and logs messages to the system console, log
    files, other computers, and users as specified by its configuration file.

    The options are as follows:

    --dd
        Run in debug mode.

    --ff
        Specify the path name of an alternate configuration file; the default
        is //eettcc//ssyysslloogg..ccoonnff.

    --mm
        Select the number of minutes between "mark" messages; the default is
        20 minutes.

    --uu
        Select the historical ``insecure'' mode, in which syslogd will
        accept input from the UDP port.  Some software wants this, but
        you can be subjected to a variety of attacks over the network,
        including attackers remotely filling logs.  You may wish to use
        this option if you have not updated all utilites that use syslog(3).

    --pp _l_o_g___s_o_c_k_e_t
        Specify the pathname of an alternate log socket to be used
        instead; the default is _/_d_e_v_/_l_o_g.

    --aa _p_a_t_h
        Specify a location where ssyyssllooggdd should place an additional log
        socket.  Up to about 20 additional logging sockets can be speci-
        fied.  The primary use for this is to place additional log sock-
        ets in _/_d_e_v_/_l_o_g of various chroot filespaces.

    The ssyyssllooggdd(1) utility reads its configuration file when it starts up and
    when it receives a hangup signal. For information on the format of the
    configuration file, see _s_y_s_l_o_g_._c_o_n_f(5).

    ssyyssllooggdd opens an Internet domain socket as specified in /etc/services.
    Normally ssyyssllooggdd will only use this socket to send messages outwards, but
    in ``insecure'' mode it will also read messages from this socket.
    syslogd also opens and reads messages from the special FIFO /dev/log.

    ssyyssllooggdd opens the above described socket whether or not it is running in
    secure mode.  If ssyyssllooggdd is running in secure mode, all incoming data on
    this socket is discarded.  The socket is required for sending forwarded
    messages. Opening this socket prevents another application from taking
    this socket and spoofing ssyyssllooggdd.

    The ssyyssllooggdd(1) utility creates the file //vvaarr//rruunn//ssyysslloogg..ppiidd, and stores
    its process identifier (ID) there. This can be used to kill or reconfigure
    ssyyssllooggdd(1).

    The message sent to ssyyssllooggdd(1) should consist of a single line. The
    message can contain a priority code, which should be a preceding decimal
    number in angle brackets; for example, <<55>>. This priority code should map
    into the priorities defined in the include file <<ssyyss//ssyysslloogg..hh>>.

  UUSSAAGGEE NNOOTTEE

    In this version of Interix, ssyyssllooggdd is not started automatically when the
    Interix subsystem starts. The ssyyssllooggdd can expose a number of known
    security vulnerabilities, including susceptibility to spoofed messages and
    denial-of-service attacks when the -u option is specified. For example,
    when receiving messages in UDP packets, which can be quite large, an
    unauthenticated attacker can flood the service with messages, filling
    the partition containing the log file. It is recommended to avoid using
    the -u option whenever possible.

    If you need to enable this service, remove the comment characters from the
    following lines in //eettcc//iinniitt..dd//ssyysslloogg and then start the service with the
    command //eettcc//iinniitt..dd//ssyysslloogg ssttaarrtt, or restart the computer.

    #   ${SYSLOGD}
    #   [ $? = 0 ] && echo "syslogd started"

  FFIILLEESS

    //eettcc//ssyysslloogg..ccoonnff
        The configuration file.

    //vvaarr//rruunn//ssyysslloogg..ppiidd
        The process ID of current ssyyssllooggdd(1).
    //vvaarr//aaddmm//lloogg//*
        The log files. These are typically the files ccoonnssoollee, ddaaeemmoonn, ffttpp,
        llpprr, mmaaiill, mmeessssaaggeess, nneewwss, sseeccuurree, and uuuuccpp. The ssyyssllooggdd(1) utility
        will not create these files, however; it will only append to them.
        When setting up ssyyssllooggdd(1), you should create empty files by these
        names (usually with ttoouucchh(1)):
        cd /var/adm/log
        touch console daemon ftp lpr mail messages news secure uucp
