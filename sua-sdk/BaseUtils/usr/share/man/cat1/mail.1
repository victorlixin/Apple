    You can use the mmaaiill(1) utility to read or send mail messages. It is a
    minimal environment.

    To read mail, invoke mmaaiill(1) without any arguments. The mmaaiill(1) utility
    opens your mailfile (or the mailfile specified with the --ff option). The
    default mailfile is //vvaarr//mmaaiill//nnaammee,, where name is your login name,
    including your domain name. Additional commands available during mail
    reading sessions are described in this topic.

    To send mail, invoke mmaaiill(1) with the name of a user as the operand. The
    mmaaiill(1) utility then takes standard input up to the end of file or a line
    consisting of only a dot character (..) and adds it to the mailfile of the
    user name.

    The mmaaiill(1) command takes the following options:

    --ee
        Test for new mail, but display nothing. Exits with success if there is
        mail present, failure if there is not.
    --ff file
        Read mail from the specified file instead of from the default mailbox.

    On startup, the mmaaiill(1) utility reads the startup file //eettcc//mmaaiill..rrcc, which
    contains commands (as documented in the mmaaiillxx(1) reference page). It then
    reads the startup file $$HHOOMMEE//..mmaaiillrrcc.

    The mmaaiill(1) utility accepts the following commands:

    <<nneewwlliinnee>>
        Go on to next message.

    <<EEOOFF>>
        Store undeleted mail and quit.
    !!command
        Execute the named command in the shell.

    ++
        Go on to next message (same as newline).

    --
        Go back to previous message.

    dd
        Delete the message and go on to the next message.
    mm[name...]
        Mail the message to one or more users named name; if no user is
        specified, the message is mailed to the user who invoked mmaaiill(1).

    pp
        Display message again.

    qq
        Store undeleted mail and quit; same as end-of-file (EOF).
    ss[file]
        Save the message in file. If no file is named, save it in the file ~~//
        mmbbooxx.
    ww[file]
        Save the message without its headers in file. If no file is named,
        save it in the file ~~//mmbbooxx.

    xx
        Exit mmaaiill(1), undoing all changes to the mailfile in this session. Put
        all mail back in the mailfile and stop.

    The mmaaiill(1) command can exit with one of the following:

    0
        The user had mail and the session completed successfully.

    1
        The user had no mail or there was an initialization error.

    >1
        An error occurred after initialization.

    The mmaaiill(1) command makes use of the following environment variables, if
    set:

    HOME
        The user's home directory.

    TZ
        The current time zone; used in determining the setting of certain date
        and time strings.

  FFIILLEESS

    The mmaaiill(1) utility makes use of the following files:
    //vvaarr//mmaaiill//name
        Default mailbox file.

    $$HHOOMMEE//mmbbooxx
        Default storage location for read mail messages.

    The mmaaiill(1) and the mmaaiillxx(1) commands are the same image. If invoked as
    mmaaiill(1), it behaves as mmaaiill(1); if invoked as mmaaiillxx(1), it behaves as
    mmaaiillxx(1). When invoked as mmaaiill(1), it ignores the contents of the mmaaiillxx(1)
    startup files (//eettcc//mmaaiillxx..rrcc and $$HHOOMMEE//..mmaaiillrrcc).

    The mmaaiill(1) command by itself has no ability to send mail to users on
    other hosts on the network. That requires a mail routing agent and a mail
    transfer agent, neither of which is provided with Interix.

    The mmaaiill(1) command is actually the mmaaiillxx(1) command; if invoked as
    mmaaiill(1), it behaves as described on this page.

    In all other ways, mmaaiill(1) behaves as though it were mmaaiillxx(1) with the
    following options set:

    oonneeiinnttrr
        Abort the current letter on one interrupt rather than two.

    rreeppllaacceeddeeaaddlleetttteerr
        Replace the ddeeaadd..lleetttteerr files instead of appending to them.

    ssaavveellooccaall
        Try to save the ddeeaadd..lleetttteerr file in the current directory rather than
        in the home directory.

    sseett ddoott
        End message entry on a dot character (..) instead of a tilde (~~).

    sseett eessccaappee==
        Disable tilde (~~) escapes.

    sseett nnoohheeaaddeerr
        Do not print a message summary on startup.

    sseett qquuiieett
        Do not print other messages on startup.

    See the mmaaiillxx(1) reference page for more details.
