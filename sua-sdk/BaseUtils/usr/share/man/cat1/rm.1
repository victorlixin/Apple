    The rrmm(1) utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files
    specified on the command line. If the permissions of the file do not
    permit writing, and the standard input device is a terminal, the user is
    prompted (on the standard error output) for confirmation.

    The options are as follows:

    --dd
        Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.

    --ff
        Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation,
        regardless of the file's permissions. If the file does not exist, do
        not display a diagnostic message or modify the exit status to reflect
        an error. (Any previous occurences of the --ii option is ignored.)

    --ii
        Request confirmation before attempting to remove each file, regardless
        of the file's permissions, or whether or not the standard input device
        is a terminal. (Any previous occurences of the --ff option is ignored.)

    --PP
        Overwrite regular files before deleting them. Files are overwritten
        three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then
        0xff again, before they are deleted.

    --RR
        Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument. If
        the --ii option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation
        before each directory's contents are processed (as well as before the
        attempt is made to remove the directory). If the user does not respond
        affirmatively, the file hierarchy rooted in that directory is skipped.

    --rr
        Equivalent to --RR.

    The rrmm(1) utility removes symbolic links, not the files referenced by the
    links.

    It is an error to attempt to remove the files .. and .....

    Specifying more than one --ff or --ii options is not considered an error. The
    option which appears last on the command line is the one used.

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    The rrmm(1) utility exits 0 if all of the named files or file hierarchies
    were removed, or if the --ff option was specified and all of the existing
    files or file hierarchies were removed. If an error occurs, rrmm(1) exits
    with a value >0.
