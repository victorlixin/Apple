    The _v_i_s(1) utility is a filter for converting non-printable characters
    into a visual representation. It differs from ccaatt --vv in that the form is
    unique and invertible. By default, all non-graphic characters except
    space, tab, and newline are encoded. A detailed description of the various
    visual formats is given in _v_i_s(3).

    The options are as follows:

    --bb
        Turns off prepending of backslash before up-arrow control sequences
        and meta-characters, and disables the doubling of backslashes. This
        produces output that is neither invertible nor precise, but does
        represent a minimum of change to the input. It is similar to ccaatt --vv.

    --cc
        Request a format which displays a small subset of the non-printable
        characters using C-style backslash sequences.

    --FF
        Causes vviiss to fold output lines to foldwidth columns (default 80),
        like _f_o_l_d(1), except that a hidden newline sequence is used (which is
        removed when inverting the file back to its original form with
        _u_n_v_i_s(1)). If the last character in the encoded file does not end in a
        newline, a hidden newline sequence is appended to the output. This
        makes the output usable with various editors and other utilities that
        typically do not work with partial lines.

    --ff
        Same as --FF.

    --ll
        Mark newlines with the visible sequence \\$$, followed by the newline.

    --nn
        Turns off any encoding, except that backslashes are still doubled and
        hidden newline sequences inserted if --ff or --FF is selected. When
        combined with the --ff flag, vviiss becomes like an invertible version of
        the _f_o_l_d(1) utility. That is, the output can be unfolded by running
        the output through _u_n_v_i_s(1).

    --oo
        Request a format that displays non-printable characters as an octal
        number, \\ddd.

    --ss
        Only characters considered unsafe to send to a terminal are encoded.
        This flag allows backspace, bell, and carriage return in addition to
        the default space, tab, and newline.

    --tt
        Tabs are also encoded.

    --ww
        White space (space, tab, newline) is also encoded.
