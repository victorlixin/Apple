    The ss22pp(1) utility takes a _s_e_d(1) script specified on the command line (or
    from standard input) and produces a comparable _p_e_r_l(1) script on the
    standard output.

    Options include:
    --DDnumber
        Sets debugging flags.

    --nn
        Specifies that this sseedd script was always invoked with the sseedd option
        --nn. Otherwise, a switch parser is prepended to the front of the
        script.

    --pp
        Specifies that this sseedd script was never invoked with the sseedd option --
        nn. Otherwise, a switch parser is prepended to the front of the script.

    The ppeerrll(1) script produced looks very much like sseedd; there might be
    better ways to express what you want to do in ppeerrll. For instance, even
    though ss22pp does not use the split operator, you might want to do so.

    The ppeerrll(1) script produced might be either faster or slower than the
    original sseedd(1) script. If you are interested only in speed, try both
    scripts to determine which is faster. If you want to do something sseedd does
    not do, however, and you must therefore use ppeerrll, there are several things
    you can do to speed up the ppeerrll script, such as deleting all references to
    $\ and chop.
