    The iippccrrmm(1) utility removes message queues, semaphore sets, and shared
    memory segments from the system. The options specify which interprocess
    communication object is to be removed. Generally, a lowercase option takes
    an identifier as an argument and the uppercase option takes a key as an
    argument. The uppercase option removes the object created using the
    specified key.

        destroyed.
    --MM shmkey
        Removes the shared memory identifier that was created using shmkey;
        after the last detach, the associated shared memory segment and
        associated data structure are destroyed.

        Removes the message queue identifier msgid and destroys its associated
        message queue and data structure.
    --QQ msgkey
        Removes the message queue identifier that was created using msgkey and
        destroys its associated message queue and data structure.

        Removes the semaphore identifier semid and destroys the associated set
        of semaphores and data structure.
    --SS semkey
        Removes the semaphore identifier that was created using semkey and
        destroys the associated set of semaphores and data structure.
