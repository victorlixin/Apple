    This command is a Korn-shell built-in command.

    For each name, the type of command is listed (reserved word, built-in,
    alias, function, tracked alias or executable). If the --pp option is used, a
    path search is done, even if name is a reserved word or alias. Without the
    --vv option, wwhheennccee is similar to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_ _-_v, except that wwhheennccee will find
    reserved words and will not print aliases as alias commands; with the --
    vv option, wwhheennccee is the same as _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_ _-_V. Note that for wwhheennccee, the --
    pp option does not affect the search path used, as it does for _c_o_m_m_a_n_d(1).
    If the type of one or more of the names could not be determined, the exit
    status is non-zero.
