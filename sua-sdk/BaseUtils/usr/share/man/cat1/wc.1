    The wwcc(1) utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained
    in each input file (or standard input, by default) to the standard output.
    A line is defined as a string of characters delimited by a <newline>
    character, and a word is defined as a string of characters delimited by
    white space characters. White space characters are the set of characters
    for which the _i_s_s_p_a_c_e(3) function returns true. If more than one input
    file is specified, a line of cumulative counts for all the files is
    displayed on a separate line after the output for the last file.

    The following options are available:

    --cc
        The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard
        output.

    --hh
        Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte,
        Petabyte, and Exabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to
        four or fewer using powers of 2 for sizes (K=1024, M=1048576, etc.).

    --ll
        The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard
        output.

    --mm
        The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard
        output. In a multibyte environment, this can be different from the
        number of bytes.

    --ss
        Display only a summary of the totals for all files.

    --ww
        The number of words in each input file is written to the standard
        output.

    When an option is specified, wwcc(1) only reports the information requested
    by that option. The default action is equivalent to specifying all of the
    flags.

    If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file name is
    displayed.

    The wwcc(1) utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
