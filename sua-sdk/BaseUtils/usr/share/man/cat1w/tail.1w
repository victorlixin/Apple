    The ttaaiill(1w) Windows command-line utility is an implementation of the
    Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications ttaaiill(1) command that you can run at a Windows command prompt. The
    file argument must use Windows file-name and path syntax. For more
    information, see _t_a_i_l(1).

    Note that the --ll option, which was supported in Windows Services for UNIX
    version 2.x, is no longer supported.
