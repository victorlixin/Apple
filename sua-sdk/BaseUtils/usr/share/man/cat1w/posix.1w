    The ppoossiixx Windows command-line utility is the tty driver for Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications. 
    It is responsible for starting a Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications process and then
    managing the tty keyboard input and display output for the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications
    processes which share that device.

    The ppoossiixx command supports the following options, which can be specified
    using lowercase or uppercase letters (//cc or //CC):
    //pp pathname
        Specifies the path name of the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications program to run. When combined
        with the //cc option, this allows you to start a program and set the $$00
        argument to something other than the path to the program. For example,
        ppoossiixx //uu //pp //bbiinn//kksshh //cc --kksshh starts the Korn shell /bin/ksh but sets
        the initial argument to that shell to be --kksshh, which signals the Korn
        shell that it should behave as though it were a login shell.

    //uu
        Specifies that the pathname argument provided with the //pp or //
        cc options is given in Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications syntax rather than Windows syntax. This
        option makes it easier to run programs using the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications single-rooted
        file system. For example, the Korn shell can be started using ppoossiixx //
        uu //cc //bbiinn//kksshh regardless of the Windows directory in which Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications
   is installed.

    //cc pathname [arguments]
        Indicates that the rest of the command line specifies the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications
        program to run and the arguments to be passed to that program. The
        pathname argument names the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications program to execute (see //pp) and is
        provided to the program as its $$00 argument. If used, this must be the
        last option on the command line.
