    The ppssxxrruunn Windows command-line utility starts the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications process
    specified by arg0 without a controlling terminal. In addition, the arg0
    argument is passed to the process as the $$00 argument, arg1 is passed as
    $$11, and so on. This is used primarily to start X Window client programs
    (which create their own windows) or Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications-based Windows services (which
    cannot interact with users). To run X Window client programs, you must
    have an X Window server installed and running.

    The ppssxxrruunn utility supports the following options, which must be specified
    using lowercase letters:
    --pp pathname
        Specifies the path name of the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications program to be run instead of
        arg0. You can use this to start a program and set the $$00 argument to
        something other than the actual path to the program. For example,
        ppssxxrruunn --uu --pp //uussrr//llooccaa//bbiinn//pprroogg ---- --pprroogg starts /usr/local/bin/prog,
        but sets its initial argument (arg0) to be --pprroogg. Note the use of the
        ---- option to prevent --pprroogg from being interpreted as another use of
        the --pp option.

    --hh
        Display usage information.

    --uu
        Specifies that path names are interpreted using Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications syntax rather
        than Windows syntax. This makes it easier to run programs using the
        Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications single-rooted file system. For example, ppssxxrruunn --uu //bbiinn//xxtteerrmm
        would be started regardless of the directory where Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications is installed.
    --ll logfilepath
        Specifies that ppssxxrruunn is to record all diagnostic information in the
        file specified by the llooggffiilleeppaatthh argument.

    ----
        Stop examining the command line. The arguments to the program to be
        executed begin immediately after the ---- option.
