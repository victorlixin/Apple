    A ccrroonnttaabb file contains instructions to the ccrroonn(1) daemon of the general
    form: run this command at this time on this date. Each user who has been
    assigned ccrroonn privileges has his or her own ccrroonnttaabb file.

    Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored. Lines whose first
    non-space character is a pound sign (##) are comments, and are ignored.
    Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as ccrroonn commands
    because they will be taken to be part of the command. Similarly, comments
    are not allowed on the same line as environment variable settings.

    An active line in a ccrroonnttaabb will be either an environment setting or a
    ccrroonn command. An environment setting is of the form,

    name = value

    where the spaces around the equal sign (==) are optional, and any
    subsequent non-leading spaces in value will be part of the value assigned
    to name. The value string can be placed in quotes (single or double, but
    matching) to preserve leading or trailing blanks. Setting environment
    variables is supported by the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications ccrroonn(1) daemon; it is not supported
    by the Windows-based Cron service.

    Several environment variables are set up automatically by the ccrroonn(1)
    daemon. SUA_ROOT is set to the directory in which Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications is
    installed. SYSTEMROOT is the path name (in Windows syntax) of the
    directory in which Windows is installed; it is used by some Win32
    programs. TZ is the time zone; it is used by ddaattee(1) and a few other
    Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications utilities. SHELL is set to //bbiinn//sshh. PATH is set to //bbiinn. LOGNAME
    and HOME are set from the Windows user database. All of these variables
    can be overridden by settings in the crontab, except for LOGNAME.

    In addition to LOGNAME, HOME, and SHELL, ccrroonn(1) will look at MAILTO if it
    has any reason to send mail as a result of running commands in the
    ccrroonnttaabb. If MAILTO is defined (and non-empty), mail is sent to the user so
    named. If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail will be sent.
    Otherwise, mail is sent to the owner of the ccrroonnttaabb. Mail is sent using
    mmaaiillxx(1).

    The format of a ccrroonn command is very much the V7 standard, with a number
    of upward-compatible extensions. Each line has five time-and-date fields,
    followed by a command. Commands are executed by ccrroonn(1) when the minute,
    hour, and month of year fields match the current time, and when at least
    one of the two day fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current
    time (see Note later in this topic). The ccrroonn(1) utility examines ccrroonn
    entries once every minute.

    The time and date fields are:

    FFiieelldd            AAlllloowweedd vvaalluueess

    minute           0-59

    hour             0-23

    day of month     1-31

    month            1-12 (or names, see below)

    day of week      0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)

    A field can be an asterisk (**), which always stands for first-last.

    Ranges of numbers are allowed. Ranges are two numbers separated with a
    hyphen (--). The specified range is inclusive. For example, 8-11 for an
    hours entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

    Lists are allowed. A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by
    commas. Examples: 1,2,5,9, 0-4,8-12.

    Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range with
    /<number> specifies skips of the number's value through the range. For
    example, 0-23/2 can be used in the hours field to specify command
    execution every other hour (the alternative in the V7 standard is
    0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22). Steps are also permitted after an
    asterisk, so if you want to specify every two hours, use */2.

    Names can also be used for the month and day-of-week fields. Use the first
    three letters of the particular day or month (it is not case sensitive).
    Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.

    The sixth field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be run.
    The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or %% character,
    will be executed by //bbiinn//sshh or by the shell specified in the SHELL
    variable of the cronfile. Percent signs (%%) in the command, unless escaped
    with backslash (\\), will be changed into newline characters, and all data
    after the first %% will be sent to the command as standard input.

    Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields -
    - day of month, and day of week. If both fields are restricted (that is,
    are not **), the command will be run when either field matches the current
    time.

    For example,

    30 4 1,15 * 5

    would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the first and fifteenth of
    each month, plus every Friday.

    Jobs that are run by the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications ccrroonn(1) daemon do not inherit the user's
    file mode creation mask (umask) settings. Consequently, permissions for
    files that are created by such jobs are set to 0666 by default. To set the
    umask for a ccrroonn(1) job, use the _uu_mm_aa_ss_kk(1) command in the job script
    itself.

    When specifying day of week, both day 0 and day 7 will be considered
    Sunday. BSD and ATT seem to disagree about this.

    Lists and ranges can coexist in the same field. "1-3,7-9" would be
    rejected by ATT or BSD cron; they want to see "1-3" or "7,8,9" ONLY.

    Ranges can include steps, so "1-9/2" is the same as "1,3,5,7,9".

    Names of months or days of the week can be specified by name.

    Environment variables can be set in the ccrroonnttaabb.

    Command output is mailed to the ccrroonnttaabb owner (BSD cannot do this), can be
    mailed to a person other than the ccrroonnttaabb owner (SysV cannot do this), or
    the feature can be turned off and no mail will be sent at all (SysV cannot
    do this, either).
