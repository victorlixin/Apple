    rs-232 - serial line connections

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The lines for a serial connection are described by Electronic Industries
    Association (EIA) Standard EIA-232-D.

    When connecting the computer to a modem, a straight-through rs-232 cable
    should be used. No remapping or crossing of lines should be required.

    When connecting a terminal (such as a vt100) to the computer, you must
    have a null modem between the terminal and the computer for data
    communications to work correctly.

    There are number of choices you must make when deciding to use a null
    modem. You can use a commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) null modem cable or
    COTS null modem adapter.

    When purchasing COTS, check the line mappings as described below. Most
    COTS null modems will correctly make a distributed computing environment
    (DCE) appear as a data terminal equipment (DTE), or a DTE appear as a DCE.
    Avoid COTS null modems that describe crossing lines other than those
    described later in this topic. (For more information about see the EIA
    Standard EIA-232-D).

    You can also make your own null modem cable or adaptor. A quality
    electronics store will have all of the parts you require. Unless you
    purchase in large quantities, however, a COTS product will likely be
    cheaper.

    A common remapping of the RS-232 lines for 25 lines is as follows:
