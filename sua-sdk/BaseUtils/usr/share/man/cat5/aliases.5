    aliases - aliases file for sendmail

    This file describes user ID aliases used by //uussrr//ssbbiinn//sseennddmmaaiill. The file
    resides in //eettcc//mmaaiill and is formatted as a series of lines of the form

    name:: address[,, address[...]]

    The name is the name to alias, and the address is an alias for that name.
    The address can be another alias, a local user name, a local file name, a
    command, an include file, or an external address.
    Local user name
    username
        The username must be available through _g_e_t_p_w_n_a_m(2).
    Local file name
    username //path//name
        Messages are appended to the file specified by the full path name
        (starting with a slash [//])
    Command
    ||command
        A command starts with a pipe symbol (||); it receives messages through
        standard input.
    Include file
    ::iinncclluuddee:: //path//name
        The aliases in path name are added to the aliases for name.
    E-mail address
    user@@domain
        An e-mail address in RFC 822 format.

    Lines beginning with white space are continuation lines. Another way to
    continue lines is by placing a backslash directly before a newline. Lines
    beginning with ## are comments.

    Aliasing occurs only on local names. Loops can not occur, since no message
    will be sent to any person more than once.

    After aliasing has been done, local and valid recipients who have a
    .forward file in their home directory have messages forwarded to the list
    of users defined in that file.

    This is only the raw data file; the actual aliasing information is placed
    into a binary format in the file //eettcc//mmaaiill//aalliiaasseess..ddbb using the program
    nneewwaalliiaasseess(1). A nneewwaalliiaasseess command should be executed each time the
    aliases file is changed for the change to take effect.
