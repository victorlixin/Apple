    The hhoossttss..eeqquuiivv and ..rrhhoossttss files contain information about trusted hosts
    and users on the network. For each host, a single line should be present
    in the following format:

    hostname [username]

    Items are separated by any number of blanks, tab characters, or both. A
    pound sign (##) indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the
    end of the line are not interpreted by routines that search the file.

    Host names are specified in the conventional dot (..) notation using the
    iinneett__aaddddrr() routine from the Internet address manipulation library,
    iinneett(). Host names can contain any printable character other than a field
    delimiter, newline, or comment character.

    If the form hhoossttnnaammee is used, users from the named host are trusted. That 
    is, they may access the system with the same user name they use on the 
    remote system. This form may be used in both the //eettcc//hhoossttss.eeqquuiivv and 
    .rrhhoossttss files. If the line is in the form hhoossttnnaammee uusseerrnnaammee, then the named 
    user from the named host can access the system.  This form may be used in 
    individual .rrhhoossttss files to allow remote users to access the system as 
    different local users. If this form is used in the //eettcc//hhoossttss.eeqquuiivv file, 
    the named remote user is allowed to access the system as any local user.

    For security reasons, a user's ..rrhhoossttss file will be ignored if it is not a 
    regular file, if it is not owned by the user, or if it is writable by 
    anyone other than the user. The //eettcc//hhoossttss.eeqquuiivv file is ignored if a user 
    who is a member of the administrators group requests access. In this case, 
    the .rrhhoossttss file stored in the user's home directory is used. For users 
    who are not members of the Administrtators group, the normal authentication 
    process is used.

    Historically, most other UNIX systems have used one of these formats:

    [+-]hostname|@netgroup
    [+-]hostname|@netgroup1 [[+-]username|@netgroup2]

    This format is not supported by Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, however.
