    editrc - configuration file for editline library

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The eeddiittrrcc file defines various settings to be used by the _ee_dd_ii_tt_ll_ii_nn_ee(3)
    library.

    The format of each line is either:

    prog:command [arg [...]]

    or

    command [arg [...]]

    The command field is one of the eeddiittlliinnee(3) built-in commands. Refer to
    BUILT-IN COMMANDS for more information.

    The prog field is the program name string that a program defines when it
    calls _ee_ll____ii_nn_ii_tt(3) to set up eeddiittlliinnee(3), which is usually argv[0]. The
    specified command will be executed for any program which matches prog.

    The prog field may also be a rreeggeexx-style regular expression, in which case
    command will be executed for any program that matches the regular
    expression.

    The eeddiittlliinnee library has some built-in commands, which affect the way that
    the line editing and history functions operate. These are based on
    similarly named built-in commands present in the ttccsshh shell.

    The following built-in commands are available:

    bbiinndd [--aa] [--ee] [--kk] [--ll] [--rr] [--ss] [--vv] [key [command]]
        Without options, list all bound keys, and the editor command to which
        each is bound. If key is supplied, show the bindings for key. If key
        command is supplied, bind command to key. Options include:

        --ee
            Bind all keys to the standard GNU Emacs-like bindings.

        --vv
            Bind all keys to the standard vvii-like bindings.

        --aa
            List or change key bindings in the vvii mode alternate (command
            mode) key map.

        --kk
            key is interpreted as a symbolic arrow key name, which may be one
            of uupp, ddoowwnn, lleefftt or rriigghhtt.

        --ll
            List all editor commands and a short description of each.

        --rr
            Remove a key's binding.

        --ss
            The command argument is taken as a literal string and treated as
            terminal input when key is typed. Bound keys in command are
            themselves reinterpreted, and this continues for ten levels of
            interpretation.
        The key and command arguments can contain control characters of the
        form ^^character (e.g., ^^AA), and the following backslashed escape
        sequences:

        \\aa
            Bell

        \\bb
            Backspace

        \\ee
            Escape

        \\ff
            Formfeed

        \\nn
            Newline

        \\rr
            Carriage return

        \\tt
            Horizontal tab

        \\vv
            Vertical tab
        \\nnn
            The ASCII character corresponding to the octal number nnn.
        \\ nullifies the special meaning of the following character, if it has
        any, notably \\ and ^^.
    eecchhoottcc [--ssvv] arg ...
        Exercise terminal capabilities given in arg .... If arg is bbaauudd, ccoollss,
        lliinneess, rroowwss, mmeettaa oorr ttaabbss, the value of that capability is printed,
        with "yes" or "no" indicating that the terminal does or does not have
        that capability.
        --ss returns an empty string for non-existent capabilities, rather than
        causing an error. --vv causes messages to be verbose.

    hhiissttoorryy
        List the history.

    tteellllttcc
        List the values of all the terminal capabilities (see _tt_ee_rr_mm_cc_aa_pp(5)).
    sseettttcc cap val
        Set the terminal capability cap to val, as defined in tteerrmmccaapp(5). No
        sanity checking is done.
    sseettttyy [--aa] [--dd] [--qq] [--xx] [+mode] [-mode] [mode]
        Control which tty modes that eeddiittrrcc won't allow the user to change.
        --dd, --qq or --xx tells sseettttyy to act on the eeddiitt, qquuoottee or eexxeeccuuttee set of
        tty modes respectively; defaulting to --xx.
        Without other arguments, sseettttyy lists the modes in the chosen set which
        are fixed on (++mode) or off (--mode). --aa lists all tty modes in the
        chosen set regardless of the setting. With +mode, -mode or mode, fixes
        mode on or off or removes control of mode in the chosen set.
