    The iiggeettttyy(1) utility uses the //eettcc//iiggeettttyy..ccoonnff configuration file to
    determine the serial ports on which it (and its children) will listen, and
    how the those ports will be configured. If a serial port is not listed in
    the //eettcc//iiggeettttyy..ccoonnff file, it will be left alone.

    In //eettcc//iiggeettttyy..ccoonnff, each line is treated as a command line to the
    iiggeettttyy(1) child. The line is parsed as ggeettoopptt(3) would parse it. Lines
    beginning with the number-sign character (##) in the first column will be
    treated as comments.

    Arguments on the line are to be separated with white space (blanks or
    tabs).

    The first argument must be the path to the serial device with which the
    iiggeettttyy(1) child is to be associated (that is, //ddeevv//ttttyy0011). The remainder
    of the line will contain, in no particular order, the configuration
    options for that serial device. The synopsis of the line is as follows:

    path [[-b bits]] [[-I]] [[-p parity]] [[-s speed]] [[-S stopbits]] [[-t termtype]]

    Unknown options will be ignored (for future backward compatibility).
    Future versions might include additional options.
    --bb bits
        Specifies the number of bits per byte. Valid values are 55, 66, 77, and 88
        (default).

    --II
        Passed to llooggiinn(1).
    --pp parity
        Specifies the parity. Valid values are eevveenn, oodddd, and nnoonnee (default).
    --ss speed
        Specifies the speed (baud rate) for the terminal. The default speed is
        9600. If an unsupported value is specified, the default rate is used.
    --SS 1|2
        Specifies the number of stop bits to be used. Valid values are 11
        (default) and 22.
    --tt term
        Specifies the type of terminal expected to be connected to the port.
        This value is used to set the environment variable TERM. If this
        option is not specified, the environment variable TERM will be set to
        dduummbb.

    When the serial device sends a BREAK, iiggeettttyy(1) will reconfigure to use
    the next configured baud rate.

    For valid options, when an invalid operand is specified, the default
    operand will be used instead (that is, 8 for --bb). Usually, there will be
    only one line per serial device. Some serial devices might, at different
    times, require different settings, however. Therefore, multiple lines
    defining different configurations per serial device are allowed. At
    startup, the first entry in the configuration file will be used. When the
    serial device sends a BREAK, iiggeettttyy(1) will reconfigure to use the next
    entry for the serial device. When there is only one entry, iiggeettttyy(1) will
    reconfigure the line with the same settings.

    Autobauding is not currently supported.

    The iiggeettttyy(1) utility runs much like a daemon. It runs in its own session
    without a controlling terminal. The iiggeettttyy(1) utility (the parent) then
    forks one child iiggeettttyy(1) per serial device. The child iiggeettttyy(1) has its
    own session and attempts to open the device and then set it as the
    controlling terminal for its session. If the child cannot open the
    terminal, it will sleep for 10 seconds before exiting. If the child can
    open the terminal but cannot acquire it as the controlling terminal for
    its session, it will sleep for 30 seconds and continually retry.

    Once fully connected, iiggeettttyy(1) will prompt for login. It is here that the
    'break' key can be used to "roll" through different serial device
    configurations. Once a user name has been entered, llooggiinn(1) is invoked,
    and the 'break' key will not select configurations. If login is terminated
    (by signal or end-of-file) or times out, the iiggeettttyy(1) parent will notice
    and start a new child iiggeettttyy(1).

    After llooggiinn(1) completes authentication, the normal login and shell
    startup takes place. When the session leader exits, the parent iiggeettttyy(1)
    will notice and start a new child iiggeettttyy(1).

    The file //eettcc//iiggeettttyy..ccoonnff can be examined as a sample configuration file.
    It is important to be aware that many personal computer systems have a
    serial mouse attached to //ddeevv//ttttyy0000. Attaching a mouse with a PS/2 or
    universal serial bus (USB) connection will allow both motherboard serial
    ports to be used at the same time (//ddeevv//ttttyy0000 ((/dev/tty00 and //ddeevv//ttttyy0011).

    Third-party serial port expanders (cards or SCSI buses) do not all perform
    the same with respect to a number of factors. Most notable are their
    device drivers. If a system panic occurs while third-party serial port
    expanders are being used, contact the vendor of the board.

    Modems can be connected with a "straight serial cable." Terminals must be
    connected with either a "null modem cable" or a combination of a "null
    modem" and a "straight serial cable." See the _r_s_-_2_3_2(5) manual page for
    more details.
