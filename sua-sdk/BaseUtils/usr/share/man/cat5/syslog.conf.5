    syslog.conf - syslogd configuration file

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The ssyysslloogg..ccoonnff file is the configuration file for the ssyyssllooggdd(1) program.
    It consists of lines with two fields: the selector field that specifies
    the types of messages and priorities to which the line applies, and an
    action field that specifies the action to be taken if a message ssyyssllooggdd(1)
    receives matches the selection criteria. The selector field is separated
    from the action field by one or more tab characters.

    The selector function is encoded as a facility, a period ("."), and a
    level, with no intervening white space. Both the facility and the level
    are case insensitive:

    facility[[;facility...]].level[[,level...]]

    The facility describes the part of the system generating the message, and
    is one of the following keywords: aauutthh, aauutthhpprriivv, ccrroonn, ddaaeemmoonn, ffttpp, kkeerrnn,
    llpprr, mmaaiill,, mmaarrkk, nneewwss, ssyysslloogg, uusseerr, uuuuccpp and llooccaall00 through llooccaall77. These
    keywords (with the exception of mmaarrkk) correspond to the similar LOG_
    values specified to the _oo_pp_ee_nn_ll_oo_gg(3) and _ss_yy_ss_ll_oo_gg(3) library routines. An
    asterisk (**) can be used to represent all facilities.

    The level describes the severity of the message, and is a keyword from the
    following ordered list (higher to lower): eemmeerrgg, aalleerrtt, ccrriitt, eerrrr,
    wwaarrnniinngg, nnoottiiccee and ddeebbuugg. These keywords correspond to the similar (LOG_)
    values specified to the _ss_yy_ss_ll_oo_gg(3) library routine. The special level nnoonnee
    disables a particular facility; an asterisk specifies all possible levels.

    See _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) for a further descriptions of both the facility and level
    keywords and their significance.

    If a received message matches the specified facility and is of the
    specified level (or a higher level), the action specified in the action
    field will be taken.

    Multiple selectors can be specified for a single action by separating them
    with semicolon (";") characters. It is important to note, however, that
    each selector can modify the ones preceding it.

    Multiple facilities can be specified for a single level by separating them
    with comma (",") characters.

    The special facility "mark" receives a message at priority "info" every 20
    minutes (see ssyyssllooggdd(1)). This is not enabled by a facility field
    containing an asterisk.

    The action field of each line specifies the action to be taken when the
    selector field selects a message. There are four forms:

    *     A path name (beginning with a leading slash). Selected messages are
          appended to the file.
    *     A hostname (preceded by an at ("@") sign). Selected messages are
          forwarded to the ssyyssllooggdd(1) program on the named host.
    *     A comma-separated list of users. Selected messages are written to
          those users if they are logged in.
    *     An asterisk. Selected messages are written to all logged-in users.

    Blank lines and lines whose first non-blank character is a hash ("#")
    character are ignored.

    A configuration file might appear as follows:

    # Log all kernel messages, authentication messages of
    # level notice or higher and anything of level err or
    # higher to the console.
    # Don't log private authentication messages!
    *.err;kern.*;auth.notice;authpriv.none       /dev/console
    # Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
    # Don't log private authentication messages!
    *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none               /var/log/messages
    # The authpriv file has restricted access.
    authpriv.*                         /var/log/secure
    # Log all the mail messages in one place.
    mail.*                             /var/log/maillog
    # Everybody gets emergency messages,
    # plus log them on another machine.
    *.emerg                            *
    *.emerg                            @arpa.berkeley.edu
    # Root and Eric get alert and higher messages.
    *.alert                            root,eric
    # Save mail and news errors of level err
    # and higher in a special file.
    uucp,news.crit                     /var/log/spoolerr

    The effects of multiple selectors are sometimes not intuitive. For example
    "mail.crit,*.err" will select "mail" facility messages at the level of
    "err" or higher, not at the level of "crit" or higher.

    To prevent tampering, if the permissions protecting ssyyssllooggdd..ccoonnff file
    allow the file to be written by anyone other than the file's owner and
    group, the file is ignored and an error is logged in the default log file
    (//vvaarr//lloogg//aaddmm//mmeessssaaggeess), if it exists. If the default log file does not
    exist, then the only way to determine that the ssyyssllooggdd..ccoonnff file is being
    ignored is by using ssyyssllooggdd --dd.
