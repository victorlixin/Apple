    terminal - the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications terminal window

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications terminal window 
	(named in the tteerrmmiinnffoo(5) database as iinntteerriixx
    and variations. Older versions were named opennt, but that name is now
    obsolete and deprecated) has many of the capabilities of an xxtteerrmm(1)
    window, although the actual terminal descriptions are closer to a vt100
    terminal.

    The definitive description of the window is the tteerrmmiinnffoo(5) database
    description. The tteerrmmccaapp(1) description is not as complete (it lacks some
    of the function keys, for example).

    A user at the console has some additional capabilities, included below. A
    console terminal window has a path name of //ddeevv//ttttyynn*.

  BBAAUUDD RRAATTEE

    The value for baud rate returned by ssttttyy(1) is only meaningful when the
    terminal was connected to a serial port. If not connected to a serial port
    (such as the normal console window), the value returned by ssttttyy(1) is 9600
    (just as with the xxtteerrmm(1)).

  FFUUNNCCTTIIOONN KKEEYYSS

    The terminal description uses 64 function keys. These are as follows:

    F1-F12
        The standard function keys.

    F13-F24
        The function keys in combination with the SHIFT key.

    F25-F36
        The function keys in combination with the ALT key.

    F37-F48
        The function keys in combination with the CTRL key.

    F49-F60
        The function keys in combination with the SHIFT+CTRL key-pair.

    F61-F64
        The arrow keys in combination with the SHIFT key. Note that these are
        not the arrow keys on the numeric keypad.

    For a user at the console, terminals on the screen can be scrolled using
    the keyboard:

    CTRL+<uparrow>
        Scroll one line up.

    CTRL+<dnarrow>
        Scroll one line down.

    SHIFT+<PGUP>
        Scroll one screen up.

    SHIFT+<PGDN>
        Scroll one screen down.

    The console beeps when it can scroll no farther.

    The default window size is set using the Windows properties for the
    desktop shortcut, icon, or window. (For instructions on how to do this,
    see _C_h_a_n_g_e_. _t_h_e_. _w_i_n_d_o_w_. _s_i_z_e in the "Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications Overview" section of the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications Help.)

    Any console window on the screen can be resized with the mouse.

    When the window is resized, the window sends a SIGWINCH signal to the
    current application.

  CCOOLLOORR

    Colors can be set using the Windows properties for the desktop shortcut,
    icon, or window. Although colors can be set for an open window, they will
    not affect all utilities until the next time a window is opened.

    The termcap and terminfo databases contain the definitive information on
    key output codes.
