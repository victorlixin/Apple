    fs - Windows file system

    The //ddeevv//ffss directory provides access to the Windows file system. It
    contains one or more directories corresponding to the drive letters in the
    Windows file system. For example, ddeevv//ffss//CC is the Windows drive C (C:\);
    the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications path corresponding to C:\Temp would be //ddeevv//ffss//CC//TTeemmpp. When a
    new drive letter is created (as when a drive letter is mapped to a network
    shared directory, for example), the corresponding directory is added to //
    ddeevv//ffss. Conversely, when a drive letter is removed, the corresponding
    directory is removed from //ddeevv//ffss.
