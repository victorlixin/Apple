    The //pprroocc file system provides access to the states of the processes in
    the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications subsystem.

  DDiirreeccttoorryy ssttrruuccttuurree

    The //pprroocc directory contains a subdirectory for each running process and
    light-weight process (LWP) in the system; the name of the subdirectory is
    the process identifier (ID) number. Each process directory contains files
    that describe the state of the process. Access to the files is restricted
    to the owner or to a user with appropriate privileges. These files are as
    follows:

    aass
        Address space. This is a read/write file.

    ccmmddlliinnee
        The command line that invoked the process. Each argument is terminated
        by a nul.

    ccttll
        Control file. This control file is write-only. The following control
        messages are defined in <sys/procfs>:

        PCSTOP
            Stop process cold.

        PCRUN
            Resume a stopped process.

        PCWSTOP
            Block until traced process stops on event of interest.

        PCSTRACE
            Set signal trace bits.

        PCSFAULT
            Set fault trace bits.

        PCSENTRY
            Set sysentry trace bits.

        PCSEXIT
            Set sysexit trace bits.

        PCCFAULT
            Clear current fault (if stopped on fault).

        PCSREG
            Set general registers.

        PCSFPREG
            Set floating point registers.

    eennvviirroonn
        The environment of the process.

    mmaapp
        Read-only map of the virtual memory address space.

    ppssiinnffoo
        Contains miscellaneous information about the process and the
        representative light-weight process (LWP) needed by the ppss(1) command.
        The ppssiinnffoo process file is accessible after a process becomes a
        zombie. The file contains a ppssiinnffoo structure (as defined in <sys/
        procfs.h>) that contains an embedded llwwppssiinnffoo structure for the
        representative LWP.

    ssttaatt
        Human readable read-only status information. For example:
        argv0   /bin/ksh
        pid     1923
        ppid    1
        pgid    1923
        ruser   1123834 100000125fa
        user    1123834 100000125fa
        rgroup  1049089 100000201
        group   1049089 100000201
        utime   31
        stime   375
        cutime  2828
        cstime  1343
        tty     ttyn01
        state   3
        flags   22
        etime   8888366
        vsize   16429056
        wsize   2170880
        sid     1923
        inpsx   1
        natpid  1568
        natsid  0
        nice    2
        wchan   0
        sttime  1054884358
        openfdcount     4

    ssttaattuuss
        Binary status information. It corresponds to the System V r4.2 status
        file, and consists of a ppssttaattuuss__tt structure as defined in <sys/
        procfs.h>. It is used by ggddbb(1).

    llwwpp
        A directory containing one subdirectory for each thread in the
        process. The name of the thread directory is the thread identifier
        (LWPID).
        A directory in //pprroocc//pid//llwwpp//lwpid contains the following entries:

        llwwppccttll
            Write-only control file. The messages written to this file affect
            the specific LWP rather than the representative LWP, as is the
            case for the process's ccttll file.

        llwwppssttaattuuss
            LWP-specific state information. This file contains the llwwppssttaattuuss__tt
            structure as defined in <sys/procfs.h> and is used by ggddbb(1). It
            can contain the following messages:

            PCSTOP
                Stop thread cold.

            PCRUN
                Resume a stopped thread.

            PCWSTOP
                Block until traced thread stops on event of interest.
        The llwwppccttll and llwwppssttaattuuss files are the same as the ccttll and ssttaattuuss
        files for a process, but their scope is limited to a particular
        thread.

  NNOOTTEE

    The format of the contents of the pprroocc directory as found in the current
    release as well as any structures defined in pprrooccffss..hh and uuccoonntteexxtt..hh are
    not guaranteed to be valid in future releases.
