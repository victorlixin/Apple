    Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications supports two types of tape devices. These devices can be accessed
    as files in the //ddeevv directory.

    Files named ttaappeen, where n is a number between 0 and 9, are tape devices
    that rewind upon being closed.

    Files named nnttaappeen, where n is a number between 0 and 9, are tape devices
    that do not rewind upon being closed.

    These tape devices represent physical tape drives for which Windows
    drivers are installed and running. Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications cannot access the tape drive if
    Windows utilities cannot access the device.
