       The  routines in this section are Berkeley Systems Distri-
       bution (BSD) routines for  directory  manipulation.   They
       are  provided  for  compatibility with applications origi-
       nally written for BSD systems;  the  equivalent  System  V
       routines should be used instead.

       These  routines  do  not  conform  to any current industry
       standard.  See the manual page  section  given  above  for
       standard  libc routines that conform to X/Open Portability
       Guide, Issue 4, Version 2.
