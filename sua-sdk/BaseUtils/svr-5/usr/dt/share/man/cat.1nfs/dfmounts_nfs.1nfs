       The  -specific  dfmounts command shows the local resources
       currently mounted by clients through Network  File  System
       (),  along  with  a  list of clients that have mounted the
       resource.

       dfmounts may not indicate the correct state if you mount a
       single resource on more than one directory.

   OOppttiioonnss
       The  following  options are available to the dfmounts com-
       mand: Specifies the File System Type (fstype). This option
       may  be  omitted if  is the only filesystem type listed in
       the file /etc/dfs/fstypes.  Suppress the  header  line  in
       the  output  of  dfmounts.  Any system on the network that
       has made resources available to your machine. If server is
       specified,  it  shows  the  resources  available from that
       machine,  along  with  the  current  clients  using   each
       resource.

       If  no  server  is specified, then server is assumed to be
       the local system. The resources on the local  system  that
       are  currently mounted by other clients, along with a list
       of those clients, are displayed.

       The output from dfmounts prints the header, followed by  a
       list  of lines containing whitespace-separated fields. For
       each  resource,  the  fields  are:  resource  server  path
       clients  where  This  field  has  no  meaning for , and is
       filled with a hyphen -.  Specifies the machine from  which
       the  resource  was  mounted.   Specifies  the  path of the
       shared resource.  A comma-separated list of  systems  that
       currently have the resource mounted.
