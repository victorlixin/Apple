       The nfsstat command displays statistical information about
       the
        (Network File System) and RPC  (Remote  Procedure  Call),
       interfaces  to  the  kernel. It can also be used to reini-
       tialize this information.

   OOppttiioonnss
       The options for nfsstat are  as  follows:  Display  client
       information.  Only  the  client  side  and RPC information
       will be printed. Can  be  combined  with  the  -n  and  -r
       options  to  print client  or client RPC information only.
       Display server information.  Display  information.  infor-
       mation  for  both  the  client  and  server  side  will be
       printed. Can be combined with the -c  and  -s  options  to
       print  client  or  server   information only.  Display RPC
       information.  Zero (reinitialize) statistics. This  option
       is  for use by a privileged user only, and can be combined
       with any of the above options to zero particular  sets  of
       statistics  after  printing  them.   Specify  an alternate
       location for the   kernel.  The  default  is  /stand/unix.
       Specify  an  alternate  location  of the special file from
       where to read kernel memory. The default is /dev/kmem.

       receive  number  of  packets that were too short number of
       packets that had a malformed header  The  server   display
       shows  the  number of  calls received (calls) and rejected
       (badcalls), and the counts and percentages for the various
       calls that were made.

       The  client  RPC  display  includes  the following fields:
       total number of RPC calls sent total of calls rejected  by
       a  server  number  of times a call had to be retransmitted
       number of times a reply did not match the call  number  of
       times  a call timed out number of times a call had to wait
       on a busy CLIENT handle  number  of  times  authentication
       information  had to be refreshed The client  display shows
       the number of calls sent (calls) and rejected  (badcalls),
       as  well  as  the  number  of  times  a  CLIENT handle was
       received (nclget), the number of times a call had to sleep

       If no options are given, the default action is as  if  the
       command  nfsstat  -csnr  had  been entered.  This displays
       everything but reinitializes nothing.
