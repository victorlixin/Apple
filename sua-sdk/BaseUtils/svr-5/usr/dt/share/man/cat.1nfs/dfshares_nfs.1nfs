       The  -specific dfshares command provides information about
       resources available to the host through the  Network  File
       System.

   OOppttiioonnss
       The  following  options are available to the dfshares com-
       mand: Specifies the File System Type. This option  may  be
       omitted  if   is  the  only  filesystem type listed in the
       /etc/dfs/fstypes file.  Suppress the header  line  in  the
       output  of  dfshares.   Use  only  udp  to gather dfshares
       information. This option will decrease the time  it  takes
       the command to return if a host is down. The default is to
       try to get the dfshares information  over  tcp  first.  If
       that  fails, then udp is tried.  Any system on the network
       that has made resources available to your machine.  If  no
       server  is  specified,  then  server  is assumed to be the
       local system. More than one server can be  specified  with
       dfshares

       access permissions granted to the client systems; however,

       resource and populates the field with a hyphen (-).  Spec-
