       The rlogin command establishes a remote login session from
       your terminal to the remote machine named hostname.

   OOppttiioonnss
       rlogin takes the  following  options:  Disable  local  tty
       character output processing (stty -opost) for the duration
       of the session.  Strip local input characters  to  7  bits
       (stty  strip).   Do  not strip local input characters to 7
       bits (stty -strip).  Specify a different escape character,
       c,  for  the line used to disconnect from the remote host.
       If c is the null string (""), no character is  treated  as
       the  escape  character.   Specify a different username for
       the remote login.  If you do  not  use  this  option,  the
       remote user name used is the same as your local user name.

       Lines that you type which start with the  tilde  character
       are  ``escape  sequences''  (the  escape  character can be
       changed using the -e options): Disconnect from the  remote
       host.  Note that this is not the same as a logout, because
       the local host breaks the connection with  no  warning  to
       the  remote  end.  Execute a local sub-shell.  Suspend the
       login session (only if you are using a shell with Job Con-
       trol).   susp-char  is your ``suspend'' character, usually
       ctrlZ (see

       Hostnames are listed in the hosts data base, which may  be
       contained  in  the /etc/hosts file, in the Internet domain
       name server, or in both.  Each host has one official  name
       (the  first  name  in the data base entry), and optionally
       one or more nicknames.   Either  official  host  names  or
       nicknames may be specified in hostname.

       If  hostname  is not specified, rlogin looks at the string
       by which it is invoked and uses it as the host name.  This
       feature  allows a user to create a link to /usr/bin/rlogin
       that can be named after a frequently accessed  host.   For
       example,  the  symbolic  link $HOME/bin/marble pointing to
       /usr/bin/rlogin can be invoked as marble  (if  the  user's
       PATH variable contains $HOME/bin).

       Each remote machine may have a file named /etc/hosts.equiv
       containing a list of trusted  host  names  with  which  it
       shares  user names.  Users with the same user name on both

                                                                1

       the local and remote machine may rlogin from the  machines
       listed in the remote machine's /etc/hosts.equiv file with-
       out supplying a password.  Individual users may set  up  a
       similar  private equivalence list with the file .rhosts in
       their home directories.  Each line in this  file  contains
       two names: a hostname and a username separated by a space.
       An entry in a remote user's .rhosts file permits the  user
       named  username  who  is logged into hostname to log in to
       the remote machine as the remote user without supplying  a
       password.   If  the name of the local host is not found in
       the /etc/hosts.equiv file on the remote machine,  and  the
       local  user name and host name are not found in the remote
       user's .rhosts  file, then the remote machine will  prompt
       for  a password.  Hostnames listed in /etc/hosts.equiv and
       .rhosts files must be the official host  names  listed  in
       the  hosts  data base; nicknames may not be used in either
       of these files.

       To counter security problems, the  .rhosts  file  must  be
       owned by either the remote user or by a privileged user.

       The  remote terminal type is the same as your local termi-
       nal type (as given in  your  environment  TERM  variable).
       The  terminal  or window size is also copied to the remote
       system if the server supports the option, and  changes  in
       size  are  reflected  as well.  All echoing takes place at
       the remote site, so that (except for  delays)  the  remote
       login  is transparent.  Flow control using ctrlS and ctrlQ
       and flushing of input and output on interrupts are handled
       properly.

       If  the  -L,  -7,  and -8 options are not used, your local
       opost and istrip stty settings are maintained.

       Note that, when a system is  listed  in  hosts.equiv,  its
       security  must be as good as local security.  One insecure
       system listed in hosts.equiv can compromise  the  security
       of the entire system.

       When  a  line  of  the  form  hostname username appears in
       hosts.equiv, the user named may log in as  anyone  in  the
       local  password  file by using the command rlogin -l user-
       name hostname where username is any valid user name in the
       passwd file.

       This  implementation can only use the TCP network service.
