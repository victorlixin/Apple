       The  rwho  command  produces output similar to but for all
       machines on your network.

       If no report has been received from a machine for  5  min-
       utes,  rwho  assumes  the  machine  is  down, and does not
       report users last known to be logged into that machine.

       If a user has not typed to the  system  for  a  minute  or
       more,  rwho  reports  this  idle  time.  If a user has not
       typed to the system for an hour or more, the user is omit-
       ted from the output of rwho unless the -a flag is given.

       The  -a  option reports all users whether or not they have
       typed to the system in the past hour.

       rwho does not work through gateways.

       rwho is unwieldy when the number of machines on the  local
       net is large.

       The rwho service daemon, must be enabled for the rwho com-
       mand to return useful results.

       For rwho to work properly, the  directory  /var/spool/rwho
       must  be  created  by the system administrator.  Given the
       adverse effect rwho can have on system and network perfor-
       mance,  the  system  administrator must decide whether the
       benefits of the rwho feature  are  worth  the  performance
       cost.
