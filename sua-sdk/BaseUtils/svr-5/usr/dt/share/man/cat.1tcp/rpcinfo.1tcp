       The rpcinfo command makes an RPC call to an RPC server and
       reports what it finds.

   OOppttiioonnss
       rpcinfo takes the following options: Specifies the  trans-
       port  on  which the service is required. If this option is
       not specified, rpcinfo uses the transport specified in the
       NETPATH environment variable, or if that is unset or null,
       in the netconfig database. This is a  generic  option  and
       can be used in conjunction with any other option. If it is
       used with the -b option, however,  it  will  succeed  only
       with   a   transport   that  supports  broadcasting.   Use
       serv_address as the (universal) address for the service on
       transport,  procedure  0  of  the  specified  program, and
       report whether a response was received. The use of the  -T
       option is required with the -a option.

       If version is not specified, rpcinfo tries to ping all the
       available version numbers for that program  number.   This
       option  avoids calls to remote rpcbind to find the address
       of the service. serv_address is specified in the universal
       address format of the given transport.  Make an RPC broad-
       cast to procedure 0 of program with version number version
       and report all hosts that respond.  If transport is speci-
       fied, rpcinfo broadcasts its request only on  that  trans-
       port.  If  broadcasting  is not supported by transport, an
       error message is  printed.  Only  UDP  transports  support
       broadcasting.   Delete registration for the RPC service of
       the specified program and version. If transport is  speci-
       fied,  unregister the service on only that transport, oth-
       erwise unregister the service on  all  the  transports  on
       which  it  was  registered.   This option can be exercised
       only by a privileged user.  Limit display  to  information
       about  the  specified program and version on the specified

                                                                1

       host.  Display information about rpcbind operation on  the
       specified host.  Use portnum as the port number for the -t
       and -u options instead of the port  number  given  by  the
       port  map.  Use of this option avoids a call to the remote
       port map to find out the address of  the  service.   Probe
       the  port  map on host, and print a list of all registered
       RPC programs. If host is not specified,  rpcinfo  defaults
       to the local host.  Shorten display by giving all informa-
       tion about each program on a single  line.   Make  an  RPC
       call  to  procedure  0  of  program on the specified host,
       using TCP; report whether a response was  received.   Make
       an  RPC  call  to  procedure 0 of program on the specified
       host, using UDP; report whether a response  was  received.
       The program argument is a number.

       The version number is required for -b, -d, and -l options.
       When a version is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that
       version  of program.  If version is not specified, rpcinfo
       attempts to find all the registered  version  numbers  for
       the  specified program by calling version 0, which is pre-
       sumed not to exist.  If version 0 exists, rpcinfo attempts
       to  find all program's registered version numbers by call-
       ing an extremely high version  number  instead,  and  then
       attempts to call each registered version.

       In the first synopsis, rpcinfo lists all RPC services reg-
       istered with rpcbind on host. If host  is  not  specified,
       rpcinfo defaults to the local host.

       In  the  second  synopsis,  or  if  rpcinfo cannot contact
       rpcbind, rpcinfo lists all RPC  services  registered  with
       the  port mapper portmap. The format in which the informa-
       tion is printed is different for the first and second syn-
       opses  since  the  first gets its information from rpcbind
       (version 3) and the second from portmap (version 2).

       The third synopsis makes an RPC call  to  procedure  0  of
       program  with  version  number version on host and reports
       whether a response was received. transport is  the  trans-
       port  which  is to be used for contacting the service. The
       remote address of the service is obtained by making a call
       to remote rpcbind.
