       The  rusers  command  produces  output  similar to but for
       remote machines.  It broadcasts on the local network,  and
       prints the responses it receives.

       rusers  takes  the  following options: Give a report for a
       machine even if no users are logged on.   Sort  alphabeti-
       cally  by  host  name.   Sort by idle time.  Give a longer
       listing in the style of Sort by number of users.

       Normally, the listing is in the order that  responses  are
       received,  but this order can be changed by specifying one
       of the options listed below.  When the host arguments  are
       given,  rather  than  broadcasting, rusers will only query
       the list of specified hosts.

       The default is to print out the names of the users  logged
       in, with one line per machine.  When the -l flag is given,
       additional information is printed for each user, including
       idle time, when user logged in, and tty.

       A  remote host will only respond if it is running the dae-
       mon, which may be started up from or
