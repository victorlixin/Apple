       The rcp command copies files between machines.

       rcp takes the following options: Attempt to give each copy
       the same modification times, access times,  and  modes  as
       the  original file.  Copy each subtree rooted at filename;
       in this case the destination must be a directory.

       Each filename or directory argument  is  either  a  remote
       file  name of the form: hostname:path or a local file name
       (containing no : characters, or a / before any  :  charac-
       ters).

       If  filename  is  not  a full path name, it is interpreted
       relative to your home directory on hostname.  A path on  a
       remote  host  may be quoted (using \, ", or ') so that the
       metacharacters are interpreted remotely.

       rcp does not prompt for passwords; your current local user
       name  must exist on hostname and allow remote command exe-
       cution by

       rcp handles third party copies, where neither  source  nor
       target  files  are  on the current machine.  Hostnames may
       also take the form username@hostname:filename to use user-
       name  rather than your current local user name as the user
       name on the  remote  host.   rcp  also  supports  Internet
       domain  addressing  of  the  remote  host,  so that: user-
       name@host.domain:filename specifies  the  username  to  be
       used,  the  hostname,  and  the  domain in which that host
       resides.  Filenames that are not full path names  will  be
       interpreted  relative  to  the  home directory of the user
       named username, on the remote host.

       The destination hostname may  also  take  the  form  host-
       name.username:filename  to  support  destination  machines
       that are running older versions of rcp.

       Each remote machine may have a file named /etc/hosts.equiv
       containing  a  list  of  trusted  host names with which it
       shares user names.  Users with the same user name on  both
       the  local  and  remote  machine may rcp from the machines
       listed in the remote machine's /etc/hosts.equiv file with-
       out  supplying  a password.  Individual users may set up a
       similar private equivalence list with the file .rhosts  in

                                                                1

       their  home  directories.  Each line in this file contains
       two names: a hostname and a username separated by a space.
       An  entry in a remote user's .rhosts file permits the user
       named username who is logged into hostname to use  rcp  to
       access  the remote machine as the remote user without sup-
       plying a password.  If the name of the local host  is  not
       found  in the /etc/hosts.equiv file on the remote machine,
       and the local user name and host name are not found in the
       remote  user's  .rhosts   file,  then the rcp command will
       fail with the diagnostic message Permission denied.  Host-
       names listed in /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files must be
       the official host names listed in  the  hosts  data  base;
       nicknames may not be used in either of these files.

       To  counter  security  problems,  the .rhosts file must be
       owned by either the remote user or by a privileged user.

       rcp is meant to copy between different  hosts;  attempting
       to   rcp  a  file  onto  itself,  as  with:  rcp  tmp/file
       myhost:/tmp/file results in a severely corrupted file.

       rcp does not detect all cases where the target of  a  copy
       might  be a file in cases where only a directory should be
       valid.

       rcp requires that the source host have permission to  exe-
       cute  commands  on  the remote host when doing third-party
       copies.

       If you forget to quote  metacharacters  intended  for  the
       remote host, you get an incomprehensible error message.

       The  rcp  command  has been updated to handle files larger
       than 2GB.
