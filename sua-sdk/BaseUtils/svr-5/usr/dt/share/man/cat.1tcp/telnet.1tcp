       The telnet command communicates with  another  host  using
       the TELNET protocol. If telnet is invoked without the host
       argument, it will enter command mode as indicated  by  its
       prompt  telnet>. In this mode, telnet will accept and exe-
       cute the commands listed below; if telnet is invoked  with
       arguments,  it  will  perform  an  open command with those
       arguments.

       The following options are available: Use an eight bit data
       path.  This  will cause an attempt to negotiate the BINARY
       option on both input and output.  Stop any character  from
       being recognized as an escape character.  Use an eight bit
       data path on output.  This causes the BINARY option to  be
       negotiated  on  output.   Automatic  login into the remote
       system. If  the  remote  system  understands  the  ENVIRON
       option,  then  the USER variable is exported to the remote
       system.  This option may also be used with the  open  com-
       mand.  Do not process the user's ~/.telnetrc file (see the
       toggle skiprc command below).  Toggles socket level debug-
       ging (useful only to root).  Sets the initial value of the
       debug toggle to TRUE.   Sets  the  initial  TELNET  escape
       character  to  escape_char.  If  escape_char  is  the null
       string (""), then there is no pre-defined  escape  charac-
       ter.   When  connecting  to  the  remote system and if the
       remote system understands the ENVIRON option, then user is
       exported  to  the  remote system as the value for the USER
       variable.  This option may also be used with the open com-
       mand.   Opens  tracefile  for recording the trace informa-
       tion. (See the set tracefile command below.)  Use  a  user
       interface similar to In this mode, the escape character is
       set to the tilde (~) character, unless modified  with  the
       -e  option.  Indicates the host's official name, an alias,
       or the Internet address of a remote host.

       host may be specified as an  IPv4  or  IPv6  loose  source
       route  (where each element does not need to be a neighbor)
       or strict source route  (where  each  element  must  be  a
       neighbor).   An  IPv4  loose  source route takes the form:
       @addr[@addr...]:dest An IPv4 strict source route takes the
       form:  !@addr[@addr...]:dest  An  IPv6  loose source route
       takes the form: @addr[@addr...]@dest An IPv6 strict source
       route  takes the form: !@addr[@addr...]@dest Additionally,
       IPv6 allows the specification of a mixed strict and  loose
       source route: @addr[!][@addr[!]...]@dest[!]  In this case,
       strict elements specify a trailing !;  loose  elements  do
       not specify a trailing !.

       IPv4 allows up to 9 intermediate addresses to be specified
       in the route to the destination.  IPv6  allows  up  to  23

                                                                1

telnet(1tcp)                                         telnet(1tcp)

       intermediate addresses to be specified in the route to the
       destination.  See RFC 791 and RFC 1883 for  more  informa-
       tion  about  source routing in IPv4 and IPv6.  This exists
       primarily for debugging or for use when network connectiv-
       ity  is  problematic. Use of source routing is not usually
       recommended.   Indicates  a  port  number  (that  is,  the
       address  of an application). If a number is not specified,
       the default TELNET port is used.

       When a port number is  specified,  telnet  will  omit  the
       automatic  initiation  of  any  TELNET options, unless the
       port number is preceded by a minus sign.

       After establishing a connection, file  .telnetrc  file  in
       the user's home directory is opened.  Lines beginning with
       a # are treated as comment lines; blank lines are ignored.
       Lines  that  begin  without  whitespace are the start of a
       machine entry.  The first thing on the line is the name of
       the  machine  that the host is connecting to.  The rest of
       the line (and successive lines which  begin  with  whites-
       pace) are assumed to be telnet commands, and are processed
       as if they had been entered manually in  response  to  the
       telnet command prompt.

       Once  a  connection has been opened, TELNET will enter the
       input mode. TELNET  will  attempt  to  enable  the  TELNET
       LINEMODE option. If this fails, then TELNET will revert to
       one of two input  modes:  either  the  character-at-a-time
       mode  or  the old line-by-line mode, depending on what the
       remote system supports.

       When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done  on
       the  local  system  while  under the control of the remote
       system. When input editing or character echoing is  to  be
       disabled,  the  remote system will relay that information.
       The remote system will also relay changes to  any  special
       characters  that happen on the remote system, so that they
       can take effect on the local system.

       In the character at a time mode, most entered text will be
       sent immediately to the remote host for processing.

       In  the old line-by-line mode, all text is echoed locally,
       but usually only completed lines are sent  to  the  remote
       host.  The local echo character (initially ^E) may be used
       to enable and disable the local echo mode; normally,  this
       would  be  used  only  for  entering passwords so that the
       password will not be echoed.

       If the LINEMODE option is enabled  or  if  the  localchars
       toggle is TRUE (the default value for the old line-by-line
       mode; see below), the user's quit, intr, and flush charac-
       ters  are  trapped  locally  and  sent  as TELNET protocol
       sequences to the remote  machine.  If  LINEMODE  had  been

                                                                2

telnet(1tcp)                                         telnet(1tcp)

       enabled  at any earlier time, then the user's susp and eof
       characters will also be sent as TELNET protocol sequences;
       quit  are  sent  as  a  TELNET  ABORT  instead  of  toggle
       autosynch below) which cause this action to flush any sub-
       sequent  output  to  the  terminal  (until the remote host
       acknowledges the TELNET sequence) and  to  flush  previous
       terminal input (in the case of quit and intr).

       While  connected to a remote host, the telnet command mode
       may be entered by typing the TELNET   sequence  (initially
       ^]).

       When  in command mode, the normal terminal editing conven-
       tions are available.

       The following TELNET  commands  are  available,  but  only
       enough  of each command need be typed to uniquely identify
       it (this is also true  for  arguments  pertaining  to  the
       mode,  toggle,  set, unset, slc, environ, and display com-
       mands).  Close a TELNET  session  and  return  to  command
       mode.   Display all, or some, of the set and toggle values
       (see description below).  Manipulate  the  variables  that
       may  be  sent through the TELNET ENVIRON option.  The ini-
       tial set of variables is taken from  the  user's  environ-
       ment;  only  the  DISPLAY, LANG, and PRINTER variables are
       automatically exported, although USER is also exported  if
       the -a or -l options are used.

       The  valid  arguments  for the environ command are: Define
       the variable to have a  value  of  value.   Any  variables
       defined  by  this command are automatically exported.  The
       value may be enclosed in single or double quotes  so  that
       tabs and embedded spaces may be included.  Remove variable
       from the list of environment variables.  Mark the variable
       to  be exported to the remote side.  Mark the variable not
       to be exported unless explicitly requested by  the  remote
       side.   List  the  current  set  of environment variables.
       Those marked with a * are sent  automatically;  any  other
       variables  are  sent  only  if explicitly requested.  Send
       environment variable.  Prints out help information for the
       environ  command.   Send  the  TELNET LOGOUT option to the
       remote site.  This command is similar to  the  close  com-
       mand. However, nothing will happen if the remote site does
       not support the LOGOUT option.  If the  remote  site  does
       support  this option, then it should cause the remote site
       to close the TELNET connection.  Additionally, if a user's
       session can be suspended for future attachment, the logout
       option indicates that you  should  terminate  the  session
       immediately.   Depending  on  the state of the TELNET ses-
       sion, the  type  argument  is  one  of  several  available
       options.   The  remote  host is asked for permission to go
       into the requested mode.  If the remote host is capable of
       entering  that  mode, the requested mode is entered.  Dis-
       able the TELNET LINEMODE option; or, if  the  remote  side

                                                                3

telnet(1tcp)                                         telnet(1tcp)

       does not understand the TELNET LINEMODE option, then enter
       the character-at-a-time mode.  Enable the TELNET  LINEMODE
       option;  or,  if  the  remote side does not understand the
       TELNET LINEMODE option, then  attempt  to  enter  the  old
       line-by-line  mode.  Attempt to enable (disable) the TRAP-
       SIG mode of the TELNET  LINEMODE  option.   This  requires
       that  the  LINEMODE  option be enabled.  Attempt to enable
       (disable) the EDIT mode  of  the  LINEMODE  option.   This
       requires  that the LINEMODE option be enabled.  Attempt to
       enable (disable) the SOFT_TAB mode of the LINEMODE option.
       This   requires  that  the  LINEMODE  option  be  enabled.
       Attempt to enable  (disable)  the  LIT_ECHO  mode  of  the
       LINEMODE  option.   This requires that the LINEMODE option
       be enabled.  Prints out help information for the mode com-
       mand.   Open a connection to the named host.  If host is ?
       then the help information for the  open  command  is  dis-
       played.   If  no  port  number  is  specified, telnet will
       attempt to contact a TELNET server at  the  default  port.
       The  host  specification  may  be either a host name or an
       Internet address specified in the dot notation (see  Close
       any  open TELNET session and exit telnet.  When in command
       mode, an End-of-File (EOF) will also close a  session  and
       exit.   Send  one (or more) special character sequences to
       the remote host.  The following are  the  arguments  which
       may  be specified (more than one argument may be specified
       at a given time): Send the TELNET ABORT (ABORT  processes)
       sequence.   Send  the  TELNET  AO  (Abort Output) sequence
       which should cause the remote system to flush  all  output
       from  the  remote system to the user's terminal.  Send the
       TELNET AYT (Are You There?)  sequence; the  remote  system
       may  or  may  not  respond to this transmission.  Send the
       TELNET BRK (Break) sequence which  may  have  significance
       for  the remote system.  Send the TELNET EC (Erase Charac-
       ter) sequence which should  cause  the  remote  system  to
       erase  the  last  character  entered.   Send the TELNET EL
       (Erase Line) sequence which should cause the remote system
       to  erase the line currently being entered.  Send the TEL-
       NET EOF (End Of File) sequence.  Send the TELNET EOR  (End
       Of Record) sequence.  Send the current TELNET escape char-
       acter (initially ^]).   Send  the  TELNET  GA  (Go  Ahead)
       sequence, which probably has no significance to the remote
       system.  If the remote side  supports  the  TELNET  STATUS
       command, send the subnegotiation request to the server for
       its current option status.  Send the TELNET IP  (Interrupt
       Process) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
       abort the currently running process.  Send the TELNET  NOP
       (No  Operation)  sequence.   Send the TELNET SUSP (Suspend
       process) sequence.  Send the TELNET SYNCH sequence.   This
       sequence  causes  the  remote system to discard all previ-
       ously typed (but not yet read) input.   This  sequence  is
       sent  as  TCP  urgent data (and may not work if the remote
       system is a 4.2 BSD system; if it does not work, a  lower-
       case  ``l'' may be echoed on the terminal).  Send the TEL-
       NET DO, DONT, WILL or WONT command sequence.  cmd  can  be

                                                                4

telnet(1tcp)                                         telnet(1tcp)

       either  a  decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic
       name for a specific TELNET command. cmd may also  be  help
       or  ? which prints help information, including the list of
       symbolic names.  Print out help information for  the  send
       command.  The set command sets any one of a number of TEL-
       NET variables to a specific value or to TRUE.  The special
       value off turns off the function associated with the vari-
       able; this is equivalent to using the unset command.   The
       unset  command  will  disable (or set to FALSE) any of the
       specified functions.   The  values  of  variables  may  be
       interrogated  with  the  aid  of the display command.  The
       variables which may be set or unset -- but not toggled  --
       are  listed  here.   In addition, any of the variables for
       the toggle command may be explicitly enabled  or  disabled
       using  the  set  and  unset  commands.   If  telnet  is in
       localchars mode, or LINEMODE is enabled,  and  the  status
       character  is  typed,  a TELNET AYT sequence (see send ayt
       above) is sent to the remote host.  The initial value  for
       the Are You There character is the terminal's status char-
       acter.  This is the value (initially ^E)  which,  when  in
       the  line-by-line  mode,  will  toggle between doing local
       echoing of entered characters (for normal processing)  and
       suppressing  echoing  of  entered characters (for example,
       for entering a  password).   If  telnet  is  operating  in
       LINEMODE  or  in  the old line-by-line mode, entering this
       character as the first character on a line will cause this
       character  to  be  sent to the remote system.  The initial
       value of the eof character is taken to be  the  terminal's
       eof  character.  If telnet is in localchars mode (see tog-
       gle localchars below), and if telnet is operating  in  the
       character  at  a  time  mode,  then when this character is
       entered, a TELNET EC sequence (see send ec above) are sent
       to  the  remote  system.   The initial value for the erase
       character is taken to be the terminal's  erase  character.
       This  is  the TELNET escape character (initially ^]) which
       causes entry into the TELNET command mode  when  connected
       to  a remote system.  If telnet is in localchars mode (see
       toggle localchars below) and the flushoutput character  is
       entered, a TELNET AO sequence (see send ao above) are sent
       to the remote host.  The initial value for the flush char-
       acter  is  taken to be the terminal's flush character.  If
       telnet is operating in LINEMODE, these are the  characters
       that,  when  typed, cause partial lines to be forwarded to
       the remote system.  The initial value for  the  forwarding
       characters  are  taken  from  the  terminal's eol and eol2
       characters.  If telnet is in localchars mode  (see  toggle
       localchars  below) and the interrupt character is entered,
       a TELNET IP sequence (see send ip above) are sent  to  the
       remote  host.  The initial value for the interrupt charac-
       ter is taken to be the terminal's intr character.  If tel-
       net  is  in localchars mode (see toggle localchars below),
       and if TELNET is operating in  the  character  at  a  time
       mode,  then  when  this  character is entered, a TELNET EL
       sequence (see send  el  above)  are  sent  to  the  remote

                                                                5

telnet(1tcp)                                         telnet(1tcp)

       system.  The initial value for the kill character is taken
       to be the terminal's kill character.  If telnet is operat-
       ing in LINEMODE or in the old line-by-line mode, then this
       character is taken to be the terminal's  lnext  character.
       The  initial  value for the lnext character is taken to be
       the  terminal's  lnext  character.   If   telnet   is   in
       localchars mode (see toggle localchars below) and the quit
       character is entered, a TELNET BRK sequence (see send  brk
       above) are sent to the remote host.  The initial value for
       the quit character is taken  to  be  the  terminal's  quit
       character.   If  telnet is operating in LINEMODE or in the
       old line-by-line mode, then this character is taken to  be
       the  terminal's  reprint character.  The initial value for
       the reprint  character  is  taken  to  be  the  terminal's
       reprint  character.   This is the rlogin escape character.
       If set, the normal TELNET  escape  character  is  ignored,
       unless  preceded  by  this character at the beginning of a
       line.  If the character is followed by a ., then the  con-
       nection  is closed.  If the character is followed by a ^Z,
       then the telnet command is suspended.  The  initial  state
       is  to disable the rlogin escape character.  If the TELNET
       TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has  been  enabled,  then  this
       character  is  taken to be the terminal's start character.
       The initial value for the start character is taken  to  be
       the  terminal's  start  character.   If the TELNET TOGGLE-
       FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, then this  character
       is taken to be the terminal's stop character.  The initial
       value for the stop character is taken to be the terminal's
       stop character.  If telnet is in the localchars mode or if
       the LINEMODE is  enabled  and  the  suspend  character  is
       entered,  a TELNET SUSP sequence (see send susp above) are
       sent to the remote host.  The initial value for  the  sus-
       pend character is taken to be the terminal's suspend char-
       acter.  This is the file to which the  output,  caused  by
       netdata  or  option  tracing  being TRUE, will be written.
       The default value is -, which sends tracing information to
       the  standard  output.  If telnet is operating in LINEMODE
       or in the old line-by-line mode, then  this  character  is
       taken  to be the terminal's worderase character.  The ini-
       tial value for the worderase character is taken to be  the
       terminal's worderase character.  Display the legal set and
       unset commands.  The slc command  (Set  Local  Characters)
       sets (or changes) the state of the special characters when
       the TELNET LINEMODE option has been enabled.  The  special
       characters  are  characters that get mapped to TELNET com-
       mands sequences (like ip or quit) or line-editing  charac-
       ters (like erase and kill).  By default, the local special
       characters are exported.  Verify the current settings  for
       the  current  special  characters.   The  remote  side  is
       requested to send all the current special  character  set-
       tings; if there are any discrepancies with the local side,
       the local side will switch to the remote value.  Switch to
       the  local defaults for the special characters.  The local
       default characters are those of the local terminal at  the

                                                                6

telnet(1tcp)                                         telnet(1tcp)

       time  when  telnet  was  started.   Switch  to  the remote
       defaults for the special characters.  The  remote  default
       characters are those of the remote system at the time when
       the TELNET connection was  established.   Print  out  help
       information  for the slc command.  Show the current status
       of telnet.  This includes the peer to which  one  is  con-
       nected, as well as the current mode.  Toggle various flags
       (between TRUE and FALSE) that control how TELNET  responds
       to  events.   These flags may be set explicitly to TRUE or
       FALSE using the set and unset commands listed above.  More
       than  one  argument  may be specified.  The state of these
       flags may be interrogated using display.

       The valid arguments are: If autoflush and  localchars  are
       both  TRUE,  then  when  the ao or the quit characters are
       recognized (and transformed into TELNET sequences; see set
       above for details), telnet will refuse to display any data
       on the user's terminal until the  remote  system  acknowl-
       edges  (via  a TELNET TIMING MARK option) that it has pro-
       cessed those TELNET sequences.  The initial value for this
       toggle  is  TRUE  if the terminal user had not executed an
       stty  noflsh;  otherwise  FALSE  (see  If  autosynch   and
       localchars  are  both  TRUE,  then when either the intr or
       quit character is entered (see set above for  descriptions
       of  the  intr  and  quit characters), the resulting TELNET
       sequence sent are followed by the TELNET  SYNCH  sequence.
       This  procedure  should  cause  the remote system to begin
       throwing away all previously entered input until  both  of
       the  TELNET  sequences have been read and acted upon.  The
       initial value of this toggle is FALSE.  Enable or  disable
       the  TELNET  BINARY  option  on both the input and output.
       Enable or disable  the  TELNET  BINARY  option  on  input.
       Enable  or disable the TELNET BINARY option on output.  If
       this toggle value is TRUE, then carriage returns are  sent
       as  <CR><LF>.  If this is FALSE, then carriage returns are
       sent as <CR><NUL>.  The initial value for this  toggle  is
       FALSE.   Toggle  the carriage return mode.  When this mode
       is enabled, most carriage return characters received  from
       the remote host are mapped into a carriage return followed
       by a line feed.  This mode does not affect  those  charac-
       ters entered by the user, but only those received from the
       remote host.  This mode is  not  very  useful  unless  the
       remote host only sends carriage return, but never any line
       feeds.  The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.   Tog-
       gle the socket level debugging mode (useful only to root).
       The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.   If  this  is
       TRUE,  then  the  flush,  interrupt, quit, erase, and kill
       characters (see set above) are recognized locally and then
       transformed  into  appropriate  TELNET  control  sequences
       (respectively ao, ip, brk, ec, and el;  see  send  above).
       The  initial value for this toggle is TRUE in old line-by-
       line mode and FALSE in character at a time mode.

       localchars  is  ignored and assumed to always be TRUE.  If
       LINEMODE has ever been  enabled,  then  quit  is  sent  as
       abort; eof and suspend are sent as eof and susp; (see send
       above).  Toggle the display of all network data  (in  hex-
       adecimal  format).   The  initial value for this toggle is
       FALSE.  Toggle the display of some internal telnet  proto-
       col  processing which pertain to TELNET options.  The ini-
       tial value for this toggle is  FALSE.   When  the  netdata
       toggle is enabled and if prettydump is enabled, the output
       from the netdata command are reorganized into a more user-
       friendly format.  Spaces are put between each character in
       the output and the beginning of any TELNET escape sequence
       are  preceded  by a * to aid in locating them.  If this is
       TRUE, then telnet does not process the  ~/.telnetrc  file.
       The  initial  value  is  set to FALSE.  Toggle printing of
       hexadecimal terminal data.  The  initial  value  for  this
       toggle is FALSE.  Display the legal toggle commands.  Sus-
       pend telnet.  This command will work only when the user is
       using  or  Execute  a  single command in a subshell on the
       local system.  If command is omitted, then an  interactive
       subshell are invoked.  Get help.  When no command is spec-
       ified, telnet will print a summary for the  help  command.
       If  a  command  is  specified,  telnet will print the help
       information for just that command.

       If set, the telnet command exports at least the  following
       environment  variables  to  the  remote  machine: DISPLAY,
       LANG,  and  PRINTER.   Note  that  DISPLAY  are   set   to
       local_hostname:0.0  if  DISPLAY  is  set  to  :0.0  or  to
       unix:0.0 locally.

       Other environment  variables  may  be  propagated  to  the
       remote side via the TELNET ENVIRON option.

       USER  is set to LOGNAME if LOGNAME is set locally but USER
       is not.  By default, USER is not set.

       On some remote systems, the echo command has to be  turned
       off manually when in the old line-by-line mode.

       When in the old line-by-line mode or in LINEMODE, the ter-
       minal's eof character is only recognized (and sent to  the
       remote system) when it is the first character in a line.
