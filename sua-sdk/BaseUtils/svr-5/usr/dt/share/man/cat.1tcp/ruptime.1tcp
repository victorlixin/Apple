       The  ruptime  command  gives a status line like uptime for
       each machine on the local network; these are  formed  from
       packets  broadcast  by  each  host  on  the network once a
       minute.  Machines for which  no  status  report  has  been
       received for 5 minutes are shown as being down.

       ruptime  takes  the  following  options:  Count even those
       users who have been idle for an hour or  more.   Sort  the
       display by load average.  Reverse the sorting order.  Sort
       the display by up time.  Sort the  display  by  number  of
       users.

       Normally,  the  listing  is  sorted by host name, but this
       order can be changed by  specifying  one  of  the  options
       listed below.

       Note  that,  for  ruptime  to work properly, the directory
       /var/spool/rwho must be created by the system  administra-
       tor.  Given the adverse effect rwho can have on system and
       network performance, the system administrator must  decide
       whether  the  benefits  of  the rwho feature are worth the
       performance cost.
