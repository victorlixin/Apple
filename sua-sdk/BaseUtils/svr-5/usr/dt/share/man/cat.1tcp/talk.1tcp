       The  talk  command  is a visual communication program that
       copies lines from your terminal to that of a user  on  the
       same host (or on another host).

       The  otalk  command  is an older version of talk that sup-
       ports an older,  architecture-dependent,  version  of  the
       talk  protocol.  Whereas otalk only works between machines
       of the same architecture, talk supports a newer version of
       the  talk  protocol  that can communicate with machines of
       different architectures.

       If talk is unable to establish a connection to a  particu-
       lar  machine,  it  may be the case that the target machine
       only supports the older,  architecture-dependent,  version
       of  the  talk  protocol.   If  your machine and the target
       machine are of similar  architecture,  otalk  may  succeed
       where talk failed.

       username is the login name of the user with whom you  want
       to communicate.

       If  you  want to talk to a user who is logged in more than
       once, the ttyname argument may be  used  to  indicate  the
       appropriate terminal name.

       When  first  called,  talk sends the message: Message from
       TalkDaemon@ her_machine at time . .  .   talk:  connection
       requested  by  your_name@your_machine  talk: respond with:
       talk your_name@your_machine to the user you want  to  talk
       to.   At  this  point, the recipient of the message should
       reply by typing: talk  your_name@your_machine  If  a  talk
       request is received from a machine using the architecture-
       dependent talk protocol, the  message  will  instruct  the
       user to respond with otalk instead of talk.

       It  does  not  matter  from  which  machine  the recipient
       replies, as long as the login name is the same.  Once com-
       munication is established, the two parties may type simul-
       taneously, with their output appearing  in  separate  win-
       dows.

       Typing  Ctrll  redraws the screen, while your erase, kill,
       and word kill characters will work in talk as normal.   To

       exit,  just type your interrupt character; talk then moves
       the cursor to the bottom of the screen  and  restores  the
       terminal.

       Permission  to talk may be denied or granted by use of the
       command.  At the outset talking is allowed.  Certain  com-
       mands, such as disallow messages in order to prevent messy
       output.
