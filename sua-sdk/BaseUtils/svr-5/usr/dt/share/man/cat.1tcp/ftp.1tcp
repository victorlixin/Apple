       The ftp command is the user interface to the ARPANET stan-
       dard File Transfer Protocol  (FTP).   ftp  allows  you  to
       transfer files to and from sites on remote networks.

       Options  may  be  specified at the command line, or to the
       command interpreter.  Suppress  the  SYST  message.   This
       option  is  used  to  avoid crashing a remote server which
       does not process this message and cannot deal with unknown
       messages.  If the first command after FTP login results in
       the message  remote  server  has  closed  connection,  you
       should add the -c option to the ftp command line and retry
       the request.  Force ftp to send the SYST message.  This is
       the  default  action  of  ftp.  Enable debugging.  See the
       description of the command.  Disable file  name  globbing.
       See  the description of the command.  Turn off interactive
       prompting  during  multiple  file  transfers.    See   the
       description  of the command.  Restrain ftp from attempting
       ``auto-login'' upon initial connection.  If auto-login  is
       enabled, ftp will check the .netrc file in the user's home
       directory for an entry describing an account on the remote
       machine.   If  no  entry  exists,  ftp will prompt for the
       remote machine login name (default is the user identity on
       the  local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a pass-
       word and an account with which to login (see  Enable  pas-
       sive  mode.   Forces the ftp server to send a port number,
       so that the ftp client can use this port number to  estab-
       lish  a  connection to the server.  This option is used on
       ftp clients with firewalls configured to disallow incoming
       calls  to random port numbers.  See the description of the
       command.  Enable packet tracing.  See the  description  of
       the   command.   Verbose  on.   Forces  ftp  to  show  all
       responses from the remote server, as  well  as  report  on
       data   transfer  statistics.   Normally,  this  is  on  by
       default, unless the standard input is not a terminal.  See
       the  description  of  the  command.   The client host with
       which ftp is to communicate may be specified on  the  com-
       mand  line.   If this is done, ftp immediately attempts to
       establish a connection to an FTP server on that host; oth-
       erwise,  ftp  will enter its command interpreter and await
       instructions from the user.  If a port number is specified
       in  addition  to  host, ftp will attempt to contact an FTP
       server at that port.

       While awaiting commands from the user,  ftp  displays  the
       prompt ftp>.

       The  following  commands  are  recognized by ftp.  Command
       arguments which have embedded spaces may  be  quoted  with

       quote (") marks.  Invoke an interactive shell on the local
       machine.  If there are arguments, the first is taken to be
       a  command to execute directly, with the rest of the argu-
       ments as its arguments.  A synonym for help.  Execute  the
       macro macro-name that was defined with the macdef command.
       Arguments are passed to the  macro  unglobbed.   Supply  a
       supplemental  password  required  by  a  remote system for
       access to resources once a  login  has  been  successfully
       completed.   If  no argument is included, the user will be
       prompted for an account password in  a  non-echoing  input
       mode.   Append  a  local  file  to  a  file  on the remote
       machine.  If remote-file is left  unspecified,  the  local
       file  name  is  used in naming the remote file after being
       altered by any ntrans or nmap setting.  File transfer uses
       the  current  settings  for type, format, mode, and struc-
       ture.  Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.   This
       is the default type if the remote system does not identify
       itself as a
        system.  Arrange that a bell be sounded after  each  file
       transfer command is completed.  Set the file transfer type
       to support binary image transfer.   This  is  the  default
       type if the remote system identifies itself as a
        system.  Terminate the FTP session with the remote server
       and exit ftp.  An end of file will also terminate the ses-
       sion and exit.  Toggle remote computer file name case map-
       ping during mget commands.  When case is  on  (default  is
       off), remote computer file names with all letters in upper
       case are written in the local directory with  the  letters
       mapped to lower case.  Change the current directory on the
       remote machine to  remote-directory.   Change  the  remote
       machine  current  directory  to  the parent of the current
       remote machine current directory.  Change file permissions
       of remote file.  Terminate the FTP session with the remote
       server,  and  return  to  the  command  interpreter.   Any
       defined  macros are erased.  Toggle carriage return strip-
       ping  during  ascii  type  file  retrieval.   Records  are
       denoted  by  a  carriage  return/linefeed  sequence during
       ascii type file transfer.  When cr is  on  (the  default),
       carriage  returns  are stripped from this sequence to con-
       form with the  single linefeed record delimiter.   Records
       on  non- remote systems may contain single linefeeds; when
       an ascii type transfer is made,  these  linefeeds  may  be
       distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr is off.
       Toggle debugging mode.   If  an  optional  debug-value  is
       specified  it  is  used  to set the debugging level.  When
       debugging is on, ftp  prints  each  command  sent  to  the
       remote  machine, preceded by -->.  Delete the file remote-
       file on the remote machine.  Print a listing of the direc-
       tory  contents  in  the  directory, remote-directory, and,
       optionally, placing the output in local-file.  If interac-
       tive  prompting  is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify
       that the last argument is indeed the target local file for
       receiving  dir  output.  If no directory is specified, the
       current directory on the remote machine is  used.   If  no

                                                                2

       local  file is specified, or local-file is -, output comes
       to the terminal.  A synonym for close.  A synonym for bye.
       Set  the  file  transfer  form to format.  The default and
       only supported format is file.  Retrieve  the  remote-file
       and store it on the local machine.  If the local file name
       is not specified, it is given the same name it has on  the
       remote machine, subject to alteration by the current case,
       ntrans, and nmap settings.  The current settings for type,
       form,  mode,  and  struct  are used while transferring the
       file.  Toggle filename expansion  for  mdelete,  mget  and
       mput.   If globbing is turned off with glob, the file name
       arguments are taken literally and not expanded.   Globbing
       for  mput  is done as in For mdelete and mget, each remote
       file name is expanded separately on the remote machine and
       the  lists  are not merged.  Expansion of a directory name
       is likely to be different from expansion of the name of an
       ordinary  file:  the  exact  result depends on the foreign
       operating system and ftp server, and can be  previewed  by
       doing mls remote-files -.  Note that mget and mput are not
       meant to transfer  entire  directory  subtrees  of  files.
       That  can be done by transferring a archive of the subtree
       (in binary mode).  Toggle hash-sign (#) printing for  each
       data  block transferred.  The size of a data block is BUF-
       SIZ bytes.  BUFSIZ is defined in stdio.h.  Print an infor-
       mative  message about the meaning of command.  If no argu-
       ment is given, ftp prints a list of  the  known  commands.
       Get  the  inactivity timeout period defined on the server,
       or try to set the value  of  the  timeout  period  on  the
       server  to seconds.  You will not be able to set the time-
       out period to a value that  is  larger  than  the  maximum
       timeout  period  defined  on  the server.  Same as binary.
       Change the current directory on the local machine.  If  no
       directory is specified, the user's home directory is used.
       Print an abbreviated listing of the contents of  a  direc-
       tory on the remote machine.  The listing includes any sys-
       tem-dependent  information  that  the  server  chooses  to
       include;  for  example,  most  systems will produce output
       from the command ls -l (see If  remote-directory  is  left
       unspecified,  the  current directory is used.  If interac-
       tive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user  to  verify
       that the last argument is indeed the target local file for
       receiving ls output.  If no local file is specified, or if
       local-file  is  -,  the  output  is  sent to the terminal.
       Additional options may be specified by quoting  the  argu-
       ments.   For  example,  ls  "-rt  dir",  will cause a time
       sorted listing of directory dir to  be  displayed  if  the
       remote  operating system is .  Define a macro.  Subsequent
       lines are stored as the  macro  macro-name;  a  null  line
       (consecutive  newline  characters  in  a  file or carriage
       returns from the terminal) terminates macro input mode.

       There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total characters in
       all  defined  macros.  Macros remain defined until a close
       command is executed.

                                                                3

ftp(1tcp)                                               ftp(1tcp)

       The macro processor interprets $ and \ as special  charac-
       ters.   A  $ followed by a number (or numbers) is replaced
       by the corresponding argument on the macro invocation com-
       mand  line.   A $ followed by an i signals that macro pro-
       cessor that the executing macro is to be  looped.  On  the
       first  pass  $i  is  replaced by the first argument on the
       macro invocation command line, on the second  pass  it  is
       replaced  by the second argument, and so on.  A \ followed
       by any character is replaced by that character.  Use the \
       to prevent special treatment of the $.  Delete the remote-
       files on the remote machine.  Like  dir,  except  multiple
       remote  files  may be specified.  If interactive prompting
       is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify  that  the  last
       argument  is  indeed  the  target local file for receiving
       mdir  output.   Expand  the  remote-files  on  the  remote
       machine  and  do  a  get for each file name thus produced.
       See for details of the filename expansion.  Resulting file
       names  will  then  be processed according to case, ntrans,
       and nmap settings.  Files are transferred into  the  local
       current  directory,  which  can be changed with lcd direc-
       tory; new local directories can be created  with  !  mkdir
       directory.   Make a directory on the remote machine.  Like
       nlist, except multiple remote files may be specified,  and
       the  local-file must be specified.  If interactive prompt-
       ing is on, ftp will prompt the user  to  verify  that  the
       last  argument is indeed the target local file for receiv-
       ing mls output.  Set the file transfer mode to  mode-name.
       The  default and only supported mode-name is stream.  Show
       the last modification time  of  the  file  on  the  remote
       machine.   Expand  wild  cards  in the list of local files
       given as arguments and do a  put  for  each  file  in  the
       resulting  list.   See  for details of filename expansion.
       Resulting file names will then be processed  according  to
       ntrans and nmap settings.  The mput command does not allow
       specifying remote file names.  Get file if remote-file  is
       newer  than  local-file.   Print  a list of the files of a
       directory on the remote machine.  If  remote-directory  is
       left  unspecified,  the  current  directory  is  used.  If
       interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the  user  to
       verify  that  the last argument is indeed the target local
       file for receiving nlist output.   If  no  local  file  is
       specified,  or  if  local-file is -, the output is sent to
       the terminal.

       Additional options may be specified by quoting  the  argu-
       ments.   For  example,  nlist  "-rt dir" will cause a time
       sorted listing of directory dir to be displayed.   Set  or
       unset  the  filename  mapping  mechanism.  This command is
       useful when connecting to a non- remote computer with dif-
       ferent file naming conventions or practices.

       If no arguments are specified, the filename mapping mecha-
       nism is unset.

                                                                4

ftp(1tcp)                                               ftp(1tcp)

       If arguments are specified: remote  filenames  are  mapped
       during  mput  commands  and  put commands issued without a
       specified  remote  target  filename  local  filenames  are
       mapped  during mget commands and get commands issued with-
       out a specified local target filename The mapping  follows
       the pattern set by inpattern and outpattern.  inpattern is
       a template for incoming filenames (which may have  already
       been processed according to the ntrans and case settings).
       Variable  templating  is  accomplished  by  including  the
       sequences  $1,  $2,..., $9 in inpattern.  Use \ to prevent
       this special treatment of  the  $  character.   All  other
       characters  are  treated literally, and are used to deter-
       mine the nmap inpattern variable values.

       For example, given inpattern=$1.$2  and  the  remote  file
       mydata.data  $1  would have the value mydata, and $2 would
       have the value data.

       The outpattern determines the resulting  mapped  filename.
       The  sequences  $1,  $2,...,  $9 are replaced by any value
       resulting from the inpattern template.  The sequence $0 is
       replaced  by  the  original  filename.   Additionally, the
       sequence [seq1,seq2] is replaced by seq1 if seq1 is not  a
       null string; otherwise it is replaced by seq2.

       For  example,  the command nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]
       would yield the  output  filename  myfile.data  for  input
       filenames  myfile.data and myfile.data.old myfile.file for
       the input filename myfile and myfile.myfile for the  input
       filename .myfile.

       Spaces  may  be included in outpattern, as in the example:
       nmap $1 |sed "s/  *$//" > $1 .  Use  the  \  character  to
       prevent  special  treatment  of the $, [, ], and , charac-
       ters.  Set or unset  the  filename  character  translation
       mechanism.   This  command  is useful when connecting to a
       non- remote computer with different  file  naming  conven-
       tions or practices.

       If  no  arguments  are  specified,  the filename character
       translation mechanism is unset.

       If arguments are specified: characters in remote filenames
       are  translated  during  mput  commands  and  put commands
       issued without a specified remote target filename  charac-
       ters  in  local  filenames are translated during mget com-
       mands and get commands issued without  a  specified  local
       target  filename Characters in a filename matching a char-
       acter in inchars are replaced with the corresponding char-
       acter in outchars.  If the character's position in inchars
       is longer than the length of outchars,  the  character  is
       deleted from the file name.  Establish a connection to the
       specified host FTP server.  An optional port number may be
       supplied,  in  which  case, ftp will attempt to contact an

                                                                5

       FTP  server  at  that  port.   If  auto-login  is  enabled
       (default),  ftp will also attempt to automatically log the
       user in to the FTP server (see Toggle  passive  mode.   By
       default, passive mode is turned off.

       With  passive mode turned on, the ftp client host sends an
       EPSV (extended passive) or a PASV (passive) request to the
       ftp  server  on  attempting  to establish a connection for
       data transfer.

       If the ftp server accepts an extended passive request or a
       passive request, it performs a passive open on some random
       port and sends the port number back  to  the  ftp  client.
       Using  this port number, the ftp client then establishes a
       connection by performing an active open to the ftp server.

       Passive mode is typically used on clients behind firewalls
       that are configured to disallow incoming calls  to  random
       port numbers.  See RFC 1579 and RFC 2428 for more informa-
       tion.

       When passive mode is off, the ftp  client  host  sends  an
       EPRT or PORT request to the ftp server when it attempts to
       establish a  connection  for  data  transfer  (see  Toggle
       interactive  prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs dur-
       ing multiple file transfers to allow the  user  to  selec-
       tively  retrieve  or  store files.  If prompting is turned
       off (default is on), any mget or mput  will  transfer  all
       files,  and any mdelete will delete all files.  Execute an
       ftp command on a secondary control connection.  This  com-
       mand  allows  simultaneous  connection  to  two remote FTP
       servers for transferring files between the two servers.

       The first proxy command should be an  open,  to  establish
       the secondary control connection.

       The  command  proxy ? displays the other ftp commands exe-
       cutable on the secondary connection.

       The following commands behave differently when prefaced by
       proxy:  open  will  not define new macros during the auto-
       login process close will not erase existing macro  defini-

       from the host on the secondary control connection  to  the
       host  on  the  primary control connection Third-party file
       transfers require that the server on the secondary control
       connection  support  EPSV  or  PASV  requests (see Store a
       local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file is  left
       unspecified,  the local file name is used after processing

       restarting at the end of the local-file.  Rename the  file
       from  on  the remote machine, to the file to.  Clear reply
       queue.    This   command   re-synchronizes   command/reply
       sequencing  with the remote ftp server.  Resynchronization
       may be necessary following a violation of the FTP protocol
       by the remote server.  Restart the transfer of a file from
       an offset specified as a number of  bytes.   Request  help
       from  the  remote FTP server.  If a command-name is speci-
       fied it is supplied to  the  server  as  well.   Delete  a
       directory  on the remote machine.  With no arguments, show
       status of remote-machine.  If file-name is specified, show
       status  of file-name on remote machine.  Toggle storing of
       files on the local system with  unique  filenames.   If  a
       file  already exists with a name equal to the target local
       filename for a get or mget command, a .1  is  appended  to
       the  name.  If the resulting name matches another existing
       file, a .2 is appended to the original name.  If this pro-
       cess continues up to .99, an error message is printed, and
       the transfer does not take place.   The  generated  unique
       filename  will  be  reported.   Note that runique will not
       affect local files generated from a shell command (see the
       below).   The  default value is off.  A synonym for Toggle
       the use of EPRT (extended port)  and  PORT  requests.   By
       default,  ftp  attempts  to  use an EPRT or a PORT request
       when establishing a connection  for  each  data  transfer.
       This allows the server to perform an active open to estab-
       lish the connection to the client.   These  requests  help
       prevent delays when performing multiple file transfers.

       An  EPRT  request tells the server the network protocol to
       be used, the network address of the client, and  the  port
       number  on  which the client will be listening.  (For more
       information, see RFC 2428).

       A PORT request only tells the server the  port  number  on
       which the client will be listening.

       If  an  EPRT  or  PORT request fails, ftp uses the default
       data port.

       When sendport is turned off, ftp does not attempt  to  use
       either  EPRT  or PORT requests for data transfer.  This is
       useful for FTP implementations which incorrectly  indicate
       that  they  accept  such  requests.  Get/set site specific
       information from/on remote machine.  Return size of  file-
       name  on  remote machine.  Show the current status of ftp.
       Set the  file  transfer  structure  to  struct-name.   The
       default  and  only  supported struct-name is stream Toggle
       storing of files  on  remote  machine  under  unique  file
       names.   The remote FTP server must support the FTP proto-
       col command STOU for successful  completion.   The  remote

       server  will  report  unique  name.  Default value is off.
       Show the type of operating system running  on  the  remote
       machine.   Set  the  file  transfer type to that needed to
       talk to TENEX machines.  Toggle packet tracing.   Set  the
       requested  file transfer type to type-name.  The type-name
       argument may be one of  ascii,  binary  (or  equivalently,
       image),  ebcdic, and tenex (for local byte size 8).  NOTE:
       The remote FTP server may not support transfer types  such
       as ebcdic.

       If  no  type-name  is  specified, ftp displays the current
       type.

       The default type is binary if a remote  system  identifies
       itself as a  system; otherwise, the default type is ascii.
       Set user file-creation mode mask on the remote  site.   If
       mask is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.
       Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the  pass-
       word is not specified and the server requires it, ftp will
       prompt the user for it (after disabling local  echo).   If
       an  account  field  is  not  specified, and the FTP server
       requires it, the user will be  prompted  for  it.   If  an
       account  field  is  specified,  an account command will be
       relayed to the remote server after the login  sequence  is
       completed if the remote server did not require it for log-
       ging in.  Unless ftp is invoked with  ``auto-login''  dis-
       abled,  this process is done automatically on initial con-
       nection to the FTP server.  Toggle verbose mode.  In  ver-
       bose mode, all responses from the FTP server are displayed
       to the user.  In addition, if verbose is on, when  a  file
       transfer completes, statistics regarding the efficiency of
       the transfer are reported.  By default, verbose is on.

       To abort a file transfer, use the terminal  interrupt  key
       (usually  Delete  or  Ctrl-C).   Sending transfers will be
       immediately halted.  Receiving transfers will be halted by
       sending a ftp protocol ABORT command to the remote server,
       and discarding any further data received.   The  speed  at
       which   this  is  accomplished  depends  upon  the  remote
       server's support for  ABORT  processing.   If  the  remote
       server  does not support the ABORT command, an ftp> prompt
       will not appear until  the  remote  server  has  completed
       sending the requested file.

       The  terminal  interrupt key sequence will be ignored when
       ftp has completed any local processing and is  awaiting  a
       reply  from  the remote server.  A long delay in this mode
       may result from the ABORT processing described  above,  or
       from  unexpected  behavior by the remote server, including
       violations of the ftp protocol.  If the delay results from
       unexpected  remote  server behavior, the local ftp program
       must be killed by hand.

       Files specified as arguments to ftp commands are processed
       according  to  the following rules.  If the file name - is
       specified, ftp uses the standard input for reading (stdin)
       or the standard output for writing (stdout).  If the first
       character of the file name is | the remainder of the argu-
       ment  is  interpreted as a shell command.  Note that there
       must not be any whitespace between the | and the argument.
       ftp  forks  a shell, using with the argument supplied, and
       reads (writes) from stdin (stdout).  If the shell  command
       includes spaces, the argument must be quoted.  Failing the
       above checks, if ``globbing'' is enabled, local file names
       are  expanded  according  to the rules used in (see If the
       ftp command expects a single local file (for example, with
       put),  only  the  first  filename generated by the ``glob-
       bing'' operation is used.  For mput commands and put  com-
       mands with unspecified remote file names, the remote file-
       name is the local filename, which  may  be  altered  by  a
       ntrans  or  nmap setting.  The resulting filename may then
       be altered by the remote server if  sunique  is  on.   For
       mget commands and get commands with unspecified local file
       names, the local filename is the  remote  filename,  which
       may  be  altered  by a case, ntrans, or nmap setting.  The
       resulting filename may then be altered if runique  is  on.
       When  executing  the  get command, a remote FTP server may
       perform certain archival (such as tar), compression  (such
       as  compress),  and  decompression  (such  as  uncompress)
       actions on a remote file depending on the filename that is
       specified.   Archival allows you to retrieve entire direc-
       tory hierarchies using a single get  command.  Compression
       allows  you  to reduce the number of bytes that are needed
       to send the files being retrieved.  Note that the configu-
       ration  of  the  remote  FTP server controls whether these
       actions (see are supported or not.  The request will  fail
       if  a directory to be tar'ed contains a file named .notar.

       Correct execution of many  commands  depends  upon  proper
       behavior by the remote server.

       An  error  in  the  treatment  of  carriage returns in the
       4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has been corrected.   This
       correction  may  result  in  incorrect transfers of binary
       files to and from 4.2BSD servers  using  the  ascii  type.
       Avoid this problem by using the binary file transfer type.

       ftp has been updated to handle files larger than 2GB.

       ftp currently only uses EPRT and EPSV  with  IPv6  connec-
       tions.   ftp continues to use PORT and PASV with IPv4 con-
       nections.

       The following examples show how various ftp  commands  may
       be used and combined.

       Set  the  file-transfer  type to binary: bin If the remote
       FTP server's default file-transfer type  is  ascii,  enter
       this  command  if  you need to transfer any file that con-
       tains data other than printable 7-bit ASCII  text.   Exam-
       ples  are  program  executable  files, graphics files with
       formats such as GIF and TIFF, and files  containing  8-bit
       ASCII characters.

       Turn  on  passive-mode data transfers: passive This allows
       you to transfer data from a remote server if you access it
       via  a  firewall  that blocks incoming connections to non-
       privileged ports.  See RFC 1579  and  RFC  2428  for  more
       information.

       Turn off prompting, and retrieve all files whose names end
       in ``.gif'', printing a # for every  1KB  of  data  trans-
       ferred:  prompt off  hash on  mget *.gif Retrieve a README
       file and display it on the standard output.   get README -
       List  the  contents  of the current directory using the pg
       pager: ls . |pg No whitespace is allowed between | and the
       argument  ``pg''.   Retrieve the contents of a README file
       and display them using more to eliminate multiple consecu-
       tive  blank  lines:  get README |"more -s" Have the remote
       server compress a file named hoopy before transmitting  it
       to  you:  get hoopy.Z  Have the remote server create a tar
       archive of the directory  hierarchy  under  the  directory
       babel  and  compress  it  before  transmitting  it to you:
       get babel.tar.Z Change the local current working directory
       to  /usr/tmp: lcd /usr/tmp Copy the entire directory hier-
       archy under the directory fish to the local current  work-
       ing directory: get fish.tar.Z |"zcat - | tar xvf -"
