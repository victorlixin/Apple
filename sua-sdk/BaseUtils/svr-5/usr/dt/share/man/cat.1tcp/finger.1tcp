       tion about users on local and remote machines.

       On a local query, the finger command takes  the  following
       options:  Suppress  printing the user's home directory and
       shell in a long format printout.   Suppress  printing  the
       header  that  is  normally  printed  in  a non-long format
       printout.  Suppress printing of the  .project  file  in  a
       long format printout.  Force ``idle'' output format, which
       is similar to short format  except  that  only  the  login
       name,  terminal,  login  time,  and idle time are printed.
       Force long output format.  Match arguments  only  on  user
       name  (not  first or last name).  Suppress printing of the
       .plan file in a long format printout.  Force quick  output
       format,  which is similar to short format except that only
       the login name, terminal,  and  login  time  are  printed.
       Force  short  output  format.   Suppress printing the full
       name in a short format printout.

       Note that, within the TCP/IP network, only the  -l  option
       can be used remotely.

       The first form of  the  finger  command  displays  summary
       information   about  each  logged-in  user  on  the  local
       machine, including the user's login name, full name,  ter-
       minal  name, idle time, login time, and location if known.
       Idle time is minutes if it is a single integer, hours  and
       minutes  if  a  :  is present, or days and hours if a d is
       present.  In short output format,  the  terminal  name  is
       prepended with a * if write permission is denied.

       When one or more username arguments are given, finger dis-
       plays detailed information for  each  username  specified,
       regardless  of  whether  the  user is currently logged in.
       username may be specified as a first name, a last name, or
       an account name.

       If  username  contains  an  at-sign  (@),  a connection is
       attempted to the hostname  specified  after  the  at-sign.
       Once the connection is established, the remote finger dae-
       mon is queried, passing the -l option.  The data  returned
       by  the remote daemon is printed in long output format (on
       a  remote  query,  no  other  output  format  options  are

                                                                1

       recognized).   Note that, for finger to work with a remote
       system, the in.fingerd  daemon  must  be  enabled  on  the
       remote system.  See for details.

       Information returned by the finger command is presented in
       a multi-line format, and  includes,  in  addition  to  the
       information mentioned above: the user's home directory and
       login shell time the user logged in  if  currently  logged
       in, or the time the user last logged in if not, as well as
       the terminal or host from which the user  logged  in  last
       time  the  user received mail, and last time the user read
       mail any plan contained in the file .plan  in  the  user's
       home  directory  any  project on which the user is working
       described in the file
       note that only the first line of the  ~/.project  file  is
       printed)
