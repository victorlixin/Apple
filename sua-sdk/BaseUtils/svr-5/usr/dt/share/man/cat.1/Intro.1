       This  section  describes, in alphabetical order, commands,
       including user commands, programming commands and adminis-
       trative commands.

       There  are several instances of multiple manual pages with
       the same name.  For  example,  there  are  several  manual
       pages  called  In each such case the first of the multiple
       pages describes the syntax and options of the generic com-
       mand,  that  is,  those  options applicable to all FSTypes
       (file system types).  The succeeding  pages  describe  the
       functionality  of  the FSType-specific modules of the com-
       mand.  These pages all display the name of the  FSType  to
       which  they  pertain  as a suffix to the section number in
       the command name.  You should not attempt  to  call  these
       modules  directly--the  generic  command provides a common
       interface to all of them.  Thus the FSType-specific manual
       pages  should  not  be  viewed as describing distinct com-
       mands, but rather as detailing those aspects of a  command
       that are specific to a particular FSType.

       Unless otherwise noted, commands described in the ``Synop-
       sis'' section of a manual page accept  options  and  other
       arguments according to the following syntax: name [-option
       ... ] [cmdarg ... ]

       The meaning of this notation is as  follows:  surround  an
       option  or  cmdarg that is not required indicates multiple
       occurrences of the option or cmdarg the name  of  an  exe-
       cutable  file  noargletter ...  or argletter optarg[, ...]
       (always preceded by a -) a single letter  representing  an
       option  without  an  option-argument.  Note that more than
       one noargletter option can be grouped after one - (Rule 5,
       below).   A single letter representing an option requiring
       an option-argument.  An option-argument (character string)
       satisfying  a  preceding  argletter.   Note that groups of
       optargs following an argletter must be separated  by  com-
       mas,  or  separated  by  white  space  and quoted (Rule 8,
       below).  Path name (or other command argument) not  begin-
       ning with -, or - by itself indicating the standard input.

       These command syntax rules are not followed  by  all  com-
       mands.   should  be  used by all shell procedures to parse
       positional parameters and to check for legal options.   It
       supports  Rules  3-10 below.  The enforcement of the other
       rules must be done by the command itself.   Command  names
       (name above) must be between two and nine characters long.
       Command names must include  only  lower-case  letters  and
       digits.  Option names (option above) must be one character
       long.  All options must be preceded by -.  Options with no
       arguments  may  be  grouped  after  a single -.  The first
       option-argument (optarg above) following an option must be

                                                                1

       preceded  by  white  space.   Option-arguments  cannot  be
       optional.  Groups of option-arguments following an  option
       must  either be separated by commas, or separated by white
       space and quoted (for example, -o xxx,z,yy or  -o  "xxx  z
       yy").  All options must precede operands (cmdarg above) on
       the command line.  -- may be used to indicate the  end  of
       the  options.   The  order  of the options relative to one
       another should not matter.   The  relative  order  of  the
       operands  (cmdarg  above) may affect their significance in
       ways determined by the command with which they appear.   -
       preceded  and  followed by white space should only be used
       to mean standard input.

       If you are working in a  filesystem  that  supports  files
       larger  than  2GB,  a  limited  set  of commands have been
       updated to handle such large files.  See for the  list  of
       commands,  and for more information on large file support.

       Upon termination, each command returns two bytes  of  sta-
       tus,  one  supplied by the system and giving the cause for
       termination, and (in the case of normal  termination)  one
       supplied  by the program (see and The former byte is 0 for
       normal termination; the latter is customarily 0  for  suc-
       cessful  execution  and non-zero to indicate troubles such
       as erroneous parameters, or bad or inaccessible data.   It
       is  called  variously  exit  code,  exit status, or return
       code, and is described only where special conventions  are
       involved.
