       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the  /u95/bin/sh  shell.   See  for
       more information on this shell.

       The  user  file-creation  mode  mask is set to mask.  This
       mask affects the initial value of the file permission bits
       of subsequently created files (see

       The  mask  can be either symbolic form, or octal form. See
       for a description of the syntax for mask. If  mask  is  in
       symbolic  form,  then the umask is set to the logical com-
       plement of the result of the  symbolic  definition.  (That
       is,  the  symbolic  form should specify the permissions to
       allow through, not the permissions to mask  out.)  If  the
       mask  is  in  octal  form, then each set bit will mask the
       matching permission (the complement of the symbolic form).

       If  mask  is  omitted,  the  current  value of the mask is
       printed in either symbolic  or  octal  form  (see  the  -S
       option).

       umask is recognized and executed by the shell.

       umask  can  be  included  in  the user's .profile (see and
       invoked at login to automatically set the  user's  permis-
       sions on files or directories created.

       Mask is in symbolic form. If this option is not specified,
       the mask is printed in octal form. The output for symbolic
       form  is  the  same  as  the output from given this input:
       "u=%s,g=%s,o=%s\n" owner_perms group_perms other_perms

       Each permissions string has the same  meaning  as  permis-
       sions in the arguments to

       For  example,  umask  022  and umask a=rx,u+w, both remove
       group and others write permission (files normally  created
       with mode 777 become mode 755; files created with mode 666
       become mode 644).

       The octal form of umask is only provided for backward com-
       patibility,  and  may not be supported in future releases.
       It should therefore be avoided.
