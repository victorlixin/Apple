       The ldd command lists the path names of all shared objects
       that would be loaded as a result of  executing  file.   If
       file is a valid executable but does not require any shared
       objects, ldd will succeed, producing no output.

       ldd may also be used to check the  compatibility  of  file
       with  the shared objects it uses.  It does this by option-
       ally printing warnings for any  unresolved  symbol  refer-
       ences that would occur if file were executed.  Two options
       govern this mode of ldd: Causes ldd to  check  all  refer-
       ences  to data objects.  Causes ldd to check references to
       both data objects and functions.  Only one  of  the  above
       options  may be given during any single invocation of ldd.

       ldd prints its record of shared object pathnames  to  std-
       out.   The optional list of symbol resolution problems are
       printed to stderr.  If file is not an executable  file  or
       cannot  be  opened  for reading, a non-zero exit status is
       returned.

       ldd does not list shared objects explicitly attached via

       ldd uses the same  algorithm  as  the  dynamic  linker  to
       locate shared objects.
