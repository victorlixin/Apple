       trchan [-ciko] mapfile

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       trchan performs mapping as a filter, using the same format
       of mapfile as mapchan  [see  for  mapfile  format].   This
       allows  a file consisting of one internal character set to
       be translated to another internal character set.

       trchan reads standard input, maps it, and writes to  stan-
       dard output.  A mapfile must be given on the command line.
       Errors cause trchan to stop processing unless -c is speci-
       fied.

       The  following  options  can  be  used with trchan: causes
       errors to be echoed on stderr, and processing  is  contin-
       ued.   specifies  that the input section of the mapfile is
       used when translating data.  specifies that the  dead  and
       compose  sections of the mapfile are used when translating
       data.  specifies that the output section of the mapfile is
       used when translating data.

       The -i, -k and -o options can be specified in any combina-
       tion; if none are specified, trchan uses the  entire  map-
       file, as if all three were specified together.

       trchan  currently ignores the control sections of the map-
       file.
