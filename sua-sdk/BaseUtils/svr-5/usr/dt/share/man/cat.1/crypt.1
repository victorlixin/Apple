       crypt  reads  from  the  standard  input and writes on the
       standard output.  The password is a  key  that  selects  a
       particular transformation.  If no argument is given, crypt
       demands a key from the terminal  and  turns  off  printing
       while  the  key  is  being  typed in.  If the -k option is
       used, crypt will use the key assigned to  the  environment
       variable  CrYpTkEy.   crypt encrypts and decrypts with the
       same key: crypt key < clear > cypher crypt key < cypher  |
       pr  Files  encrypted  by  crypt  are compatible with those
       treated by the editors and in encryption mode.

       The security of encrypted files depends on three  factors:
       the  fundamental  method  must  be  hard  to solve; direct
       search of the key space must be infeasible; sneak paths by
       which  keys or clear text can become visible must be mini-
       mized.

       crypt implements a one-rotor machine  designed  along  the
       lines  of the German Enigma, but with a 256-element rotor.
       Methods of attack on such  machines  are  known,  but  not
       widely;  moreover the amount of work required is likely to
       be large.

       The transformation of a key into the internal settings  of
       the machine is deliberately designed to be expensive, that
       is, to take a substantial fraction of a second to compute.
       However,  if keys are restricted to (say) three lower-case
       letters, then encrypted files can  be  read  by  expending
       only  a  substantial  fraction  of five minutes of machine
       time.

       If the key is an argument to  the  crypt  command,  it  is
       potentially  visible  to  users executing or a derivative.
       The choice of keys and key security are the most  vulnera-
       ble aspect of crypt.

       This  command  is  provided with the Encryption Utilities,
       which is only available in the United States.  If  two  or
       more  files  encrypted  with the same key are concatenated
       and an attempt is made to decrypt  the  result,  only  the
       contents  of  the  first  of  the  original  files will be
       decrypted correctly.

       If output is piped to nroff and the encryption key is  not
       given  on  the command line then do not pipe crypt through
       or any other program that changes the tty settings.  Doing
       so  may  cause  crypt to leave terminal modes in a strange
       state (see
