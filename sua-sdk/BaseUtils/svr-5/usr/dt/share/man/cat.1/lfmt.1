       lfmt uses format  for  printf-style  formatting  of  args.
       lfmt encapsulates the output in the standard error message
       format and displays the output on  stderr.   In  addition,
       lfmt  forwards  its  output  to the logging and monitoring
       facility.

       The following options are  available.   Also  display  the
       output  on the console, with a date and time stamp.  Spec-
       ify logging information as a comma-separated list of  key-
       words  from  the  following sets: Identifies the source of
       the condition.  Identifiers  are:  hard  (hardware),  soft
       (software),  and  firm (firmware).  Identifies the type of
       software in which the  problem  is  spotted.   Identifiers
       are:  appl (application), util (utility), and opsys (oper-
       ating system).  Specify that a localized version of format
       should   be   retrieved  from  a  locale-specific  message
       database.  catalog indicates  the  message  database  that
       contains the localized version of the format string.  cat-
       alog must be limited to 14 characters.   These  characters
       must  be  selected  from  a  set  of all character values,
       excluding ``\0'' (null) and the ASCII codes for /  (slash)
       and : (colon).

       msgid is a positive number that indicates the index of the
       string into the message database.

       If catalog does not exist in the current  locale  (identi-
       fied by the LC_MESSAGES or LANG environment variables), or
       if msgid is out of bounds, lfmt will attempt  to  retrieve
       the  message  from the C locale.  If this second retrieval
       fails, lfmt uses the format string as passed on  the  com-
       mand line.

       lfmt  will  output  Message  not  found!!\n  as the format
       string if catalog is not a valid catalog name, or if msgid
       is not a valid number as defined above.  Specify the label
       string to be displayed  with  the  message  (for  example,
       "UX:cat").   label  is  a character string no more than 25
       characters in length; it will  be  automatically  suffixed
       with a colon (:).  When unspecified, no label is displayed
       as part of the message.  Specify the severity string to be
       displayed  with  the  message.  Acceptable strings include
       the standard severities in either their print string (that
       is,  HALT,  ERROR, INFO, WARNING, and "TO FIX") or keyword
       (that is, halt, error, info, warn, and action)  forms,  or
       any other user-defined string.  A user-defined string will
       be assigned the integer severity value of 5.  The severity
       will  be  suffixed  with  a colon (:).  The ERROR severity
       will be used if no severity is  specified.   The  keywords

                                                                1

       and  definitions  of  the standard levels of severity are:
       application has encountered a severe fault and is  halting
       application  has detected a fault application has detected
       a condition that is out of the ordinary  and  might  be  a
       problem  application is providing information about a con-
       dition that is not in error do not print a  severity  mes-
       sage

       lfmt  displays  error  messages  in  the following format:
       label: severity: text If no label was defined using the -l
       label  option,  the  message  is  displayed in the format:
       severity: text If lfmt is called twice to display an error
       message and a helpful action or recovery message, the out-
       put can look like the  following:  label:  severity:  text
       label: TO FIX: text

       Upon success, lfmt exits with code 0.

       Upon failure, lfmt exits with the following  codes:  write
