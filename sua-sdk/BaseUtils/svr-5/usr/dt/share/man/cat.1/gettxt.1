       gettxt  retrieves a text string from a message file in the
       directory /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES.  The  direc-
       tory  name locale corresponds to the language in which the
       text strings are written; see and

       Name of the file from which to retrieve msgnum.  The  name
       can  be up to 14 characters in length, but may not contain
       either \0 (NULL) or the characters / (slash) or : (colon).
       Sequence  number  of  the string to retrieve from msgfile.
       The strings in msgfile are numbered sequentially from 1 to
       n,  where n is the number of strings in the file.  Default
       string to be displayed if gettxt fails to retrieve  msgnum
       from  msgfile.   Nongraphic characters must be represented
       as alphabetic escape sequences.

       The text string to be retrieved is in  the  file  msgfile,
       created  by  the utility and installed under the directory
       /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES.      The     directory
       searched  is specified by the environment variable LC_MES-
       SAGES.  If LC_MESSAGES is not set, the  environment  vari-
       able  LANG  will  be  used.  If LANG is not set, the files
       containing   the   strings   are   under   the   directory
       /usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES.

       If  gettxt  fails  to  retrieve a message in the requested
       language, it will try to retrieve the  same  message  from
       /usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES/msgfile.    If   this   also
       fails, and if dflt_msg is present and non-empty,  then  it
       will  display  the  value  of dflt_msg; if dflt_msg is not
       present or is empty, then it will display the string  Mes-
       sage  not found!!\n.  If the environment variables LANG or
       LC_MESSAGES have not been set to other than their  default
       values,  gettxt UX:10 "hello world\n" will try to retrieve
       the 10th  message  from  /usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES/UX.
       If  the retrieval fails, the message hello world, followed
       by a newline, will be displayed.
