       The  dump  command  dumps  selected  parts  of each of its
       object file arguments.  You  must  provide  at  least  one
       option.

       This command will accept both object files and archives of
       object files.  It processes each file  argument  according
       to  one or more of the following options: Dump the archive
       header of each member of an archive.   Decode  C++  symbol
       table  names  before  dumping.   Dump the string table(s).
       Dump debugging information.  Dump each file header.   Dump
       the  global  symbols  in  the  symbol table of an archive.
       Dump the section headers.  Dump dynamic  linking  informa-
       tion  and static shared library information, if available.
       Dump line number information.  Dump each program execution
       header.   Dump  relocation information.  Dump section con-
       tents in hexadecimal.  Dump only the indexed symbol  table
       entry  defined  by  index or a range of entries defined by
       index1,index2.  Dump symbol table entries.  When reading a
       COFF  object  file, dump translates the file to ELF inter-
       nally (this translation does  not  affect  the  file  con-
       tents).   This option controls how much translation occurs
       from COFF values to ELF.  Normally (without -u), the  COFF
       values  are  preserved  as  much  as possible, showing the
       actual bytes in the file.  If -u is used, dump updates the
       values  and  completes  the internal translation, giving a
       consistent ELF view of the contents.  Although  the  bytes
       displayed  under  this  option  might  not  match the file
       itself, they show how the file would look if it were  con-
       verted to ELF.  (See for more information.)

       Print version information.  Size of words to print for raw
       dumps: can be 1, 2, 4 or 8.  Dump only the indexed dynamic
       symbol table entry defined by index or a ranges of entries
       defined by index1, index2.  This option dumps symbols from
       sections  of  type  SHT_DYNSYM,  instead of SHT_SYMTAB, as
       used by the -T option.  Dump dynamic symbol  table.   This
       option  dumps  sections  of  type  SHT_DYNSYM,  instead of
       SHT_SYMTAB, as used by the -t option.

       The following modifiers are used in conjunction  with  the
       options  listed  above to modify their capabilities.  Dump
       the section number indicated by number  or  the  range  of
       sections  starting at number1 and ending at number2.  This
       modifier can be used with -h, -s, and -r.  When -d is used
       with  -h or -s, the argument is treated as the number of a
       section or range of sections.  When -d is  used  with  -r,
       the  argument  is  treated as the number of the section or
       range of sections to which the  relocation  applies.   For
       example,  to  print  out all relocation entries associated
       with the .text section, specify the number of the  section

                                                                1

dump(1)                                                   dump(1)

       as  the  argument  to -d.  If .text is section number 2 in
       the file, dump -r -d 2 will print all associated  entries.
       To  print out a specific relocation section use dump -s -n
       name for raw data output, or dump -sv -n name  for  inter-
       preted  output.   Dump  information pertaining only to the
       named entity.  This modifier can be used with -h, -s,  -r,
       and  -t.  When -n is used with -h or -s, the argument will
       be treated as the name of a section.  When -n is used with
       -t  or  -r,  the argument will be treated as the name of a
       symbol.  For example, dump -t -n .text will dump the  sym-
       bol  table  entry associated with the symbol whose name is
       .text, where dump -h -n .text will dump the section header
       information  for  the .text section.  Suppress printing of
       the headings.  Dump information in symbolic representation
       rather  than  numeric.   This modifier can be used with -a
       (date, user id, group id), -f (class, data, type, machine,
       version,  flags),  -h  (type, flags), -o (type, flags), -r
       (name, type), -s (interpret section contents wherever pos-
       sible),  -t (type, bind), and -L (value).  When -v is used
       with -s, all sections that can be interpreted, such as the
       string  table  or  symbol table, will be interpreted.  For
       example, dump -sv -n .symtab file will  produce  the  same
       formatted  output as dump -tv file, but dump -s -n .symtab
       file will print raw data in  hexadecimal.   Without  addi-
       tional  modifiers, dump -sv file will dump all sections in
       file interpreting all those that it can  and  dumping  the
       rest (such as .text or .data) as raw data.

       The  dump  command  attempts  to format the information it
       dumps in a meaningful way, printing certain information in
       character, hexadecimal, octal or decimal representation as
       appropriate.
