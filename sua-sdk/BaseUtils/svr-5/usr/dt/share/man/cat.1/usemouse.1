       The usemouse command merges data from  a  mouse  into  the
       input  stream  of  a  tty. The mouse data is translated to
       arrow keys or any other  arbitrary  ASCII  strings.  Mouse
       movements  up, down, left, right, up-left, up-right, down-
       left, and down-right, as well as individual  up  and  down
       button  transitions,  are  programmable.  This permits the
       mouse to be used with programs that are  not  designed  to
       accept mouse input.

       usemouse with no arguments sets the mouse for use with the
       default  map  /etc/default/usemouse.   A  new   shell   is
       invoked.  To terminate usemouse, exit the shell with d.

       Alternate   map  files  can  be  found  in  the  directory
       /usr/lib/mouse.  Users can  create  their  own  map  files
       based  on the default file.  Quoted strings may be used in
       a map file, as well as the octal sequences  found  in  the
       manual  page.   Map  files  can be located anywhere on the
       system and accessed with the -f option (see below).

       The default map file has the following values:
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Mouse                      Keystroke
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Left Button                vi top of file (1G) command
       Middle Button              vi delete character (x) command
       Right Button               vi bottom of file (G) command
       Up                         Up arrow key
       Down                       Down arrow key
       Left                       Left arrow key
       Right                      Right arrow key
       Up and Left                Not defined
       Up and Right               Not defined
       Down and Left              Not defined
       Down and Right             Not defined
       Bells                      No
       usemouse takes the following options:  Suppress  bell  (g)
       for the duration of mouse usage.  Useful with Run cmd with
       usemouse. cmd defaults to the shell specified in the SHELL
       environment  variable. If SHELL is unspecified, /bin/sh is
       used. Note that the command given with this flag can  con-
       tain  blank  spaces if the entire command is placed within
       double quotes. For example: usemouse -c "vi  /etc/termcap"
       is  valid.   When  cmd  terminates, usemouse terminates as
       well.  Select an alternate configuration  file,  conffile.
       conffile  should  use the format of /etc/default/usemouse.
       Define the horizontal sensitivity.  Horizontal mouse move-
       ments  smaller  than  this  threshold  are ignored.  Mouse
       movements  that  are  multiples  of  this  value  generate

                                                                1

usemouse(1)                                           usemouse(1)

       multiple  strings.   The  sensitivity defaults to 5 units.
       The minimum value is 1 unit, and the maximum is 100 units.
       The  lower  the value, the more sensitive your mouse is to
       motion.  Note that setting a high  value  may  cause  your
       mouse  to  behave  as though it is not functioning, due to
       the large motion required to generate a signal.  Select  a
       predefined  configuration  file.   type can be any file in
       /usr/lib/mouse, such as vi, or  rogue.   These  files  are
       identical in format to /etc/default/usemouse.

       The vi-specific map maps the traditional h-j-k-l direction
       keys to the mouse movements.  The terminal bell  is  auto-
       matically  silenced by the vi map entry bells=no.  This is
       done to prevent the bell being activated continuously when
       the  user  generates  a  spurious  command with the mouse.
       Define the vertical sensitivity.  Vertical mouse movements
       smaller  than this threshold are ignored.  Mouse movements
       that  are  multiples  of  this  value  generate   multiple
       strings.   The sensitivity defaults to 5 units.  The mini-
       mum value is 1 unit, and the maximum is  100  units.   The
       lower  the  value,  the  more  sensitive  your mouse is to
       motion.  Note that setting a high  value  may  cause  your
       mouse  to  behave  as though it is not functioning, due to
       the large motion  required  to  generate  a  signal.   The
       parameters  are  name=value  pairs  indicating  what ASCII
       string to insert into the tty input stream when the  given
       event is received.

       Valid parameters include: String to generate on right but-
       ton up.  String to generate on right button down.   String
       to  generate  on  middle button up.  String to generate on
       middle button down.  String to generate on left button up.
       String  to generate on left button down.  String to gener-
       ate on mouse right.  String to  generate  on  mouse  left.
       String  to  generate  on  mouse up.  String to generate on
       mouse down.  String to generate on mouse up-left.   String
       to  generate  on  mouse  up-right.   String to generate on
       mouse down-right.  String to generate on mouse  down-left.
       Sensitivity to horizontal motion.  Sensitivity to vertical
       motion.  Whether to remove g characters.   Parameters  may
       be specified in any order. They may contain octal escapes.
       They should be quoted with single or double quotes if they
       contain  blank  spaces.  Any parameter may be omitted; its
       value is then taken from the configuration file.

       To set up the mouse for use with vi, enter: usemouse -t vi

                                                                2

       This will not start vi.

       To start up the mouse for  use  with  vi,  and  start  vi,
       enter:  usemouse -t vi -c vi This invokes the vi map along
       with the command; when you quit out of vi the mouse disen-
       gages.

       To start up vi using the default mouse map, but redefining
       the middle button (mbd) to be insert in  vi,  enter:  use-
       mouse  -c vi mbd=i To start the mouse in vi using the cus-
       tomized map mine, enter: usemouse -f mine -c vi
