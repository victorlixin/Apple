       The  vtblank command is used to activate or deactivate the
       console screen saver by dynamically setting the TBLNK tun-
       able, which specifies a time until the screen blanks.

       Invoked  without  options,  vtblank returns a message like
       the following: TBLNK = 40 seconds.  The  console-saver  is
       enabled.  The options supported by vtblank are: Sets TBLNK
       in seconds.  Sets TBLNK in minutes.  Activates (-o on)  or
       deactivates  (-o  off)  the screen saver. Deactivating the
       saver does  not  affect  the  value  of  TBLNK.   Verbose.
       Returns the number of seconds to which TBLNK has been set.
       A value of zero is returned when the featue  is  disabled.
       The  permissible  range  for TBLNK, in seconds, is 1-86400
       (one day).

       Setting TBLNK with the  -s  or  -m  options  automatically
       overrides an earlier -o off.
