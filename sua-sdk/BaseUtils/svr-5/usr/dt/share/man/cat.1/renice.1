       The renice utility requests  that  the  system  scheduling
       priorities  of  one  or more running processes be changed.
       By default, the  applicable  processes  are  specified  by
       their process IDs.  When a process group is specified (see
       -g), the request applies to all processes in  the  process
       group.

       If  the system scheduling priority of the requested incre-
       ment (or  in  the  older  versions  of  the  command,  the
       nice_value)  would  raise  or  lower the system scheduling
       priority of the executed  utility  beyond  implementation-
       dependent limits, then the limit whose values was exceeded
       is used.

       When a user is reniced, the request applies  to  all  pro-
       cesses  whose saved set-user-ID matches the user ID corre-
       sponding to the user.

       Regardless of which options are supplied or any other fac-
       tor,  renice  will not alter the system scheduling priori-
       ties of any process unless  the  user  requesting  such  a
       change  has appropriate privileges to do so for the speci-
       fied process.  If the user lacks appropriate privileges to
       perform  the  requested action, the utility will return an
       error status.

       The saved  set-user-ID  of  the  user's  process  will  be
       checked  instead  of  its  effective  user  ID when renice
       attempts to determine the user ID of the process in  order
       to  determine whether the user has appropriate privileges.

       If POSIX2 is set, the standard output is not used;  other-
       wise,  the  old and new priority for each affected process
       is printed to standard output.  renice has  the  following
       options:  Interpret  all  operands that follow as unsigned
       decimal integer process group IDs.  Specify how the system
       scheduling  priority of the specified process or processes
       is to be adjusted.  The  increment  option-argument  is  a
       positive  or negative decimal integer that will be used to
       modify the system scheduling  priority  of  the  specified
       process or processes.

                                                                1

       Positive  increment values cause a lower system scheduling
       priority.  Negative increment values may require appropri-
       ate  privileges  and will cause a higher system scheduling
       priority.  In the obsolescent version of this command, the
       first  integer  is  taken  as the actual system scheduling
       priority to be set, rather than as  an  increment  to  the
       current  priority.   Interpret all operands that follow as
       unsigned decimal integer process IDs.  The  -p  option  is
       the  default  if  no options are specified.  Interpret all
       operands that follow as users.  If a user  exists  with  a
       user  name  equal to the operand, then the user ID of that
       user will be used in further  processing.   Otherwise,  if
       the  operand  represents  an  unsigned decimal integer, it
       will be used as the numeric user ID of the user.   is  the
       process ID, process group ID or user name/user ID, depend-
       ing on the option selected.

       Provide a default value for the internationalization vari-
       ables  that  are unset or null.  If LANG is unset or null,
       the corresponding value from  the  implementation-specific
       default locale will be used.  If any of the international-
       ization variables contains an invalid setting, the utility
       will  behave as if none of the variables had been defined.
       If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
       all  the  other internationalization variables.  Determine
       the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
       text  data  as characters (for example, single- as opposed
       to multi-byte characters  in  arguments).   Determine  the
       locale  that  should be used to affect the format and con-
       tents of diagnostic messages written  to  standard  error.
       Determine  the location of message catalogues for the pro-
       cessing of LC_MESSAGES.

       Adjust the system scheduling priority so that process  IDs
       987  and 32 would have a lower scheduling priority: renice
       -n 5 -p 987 32 Adjust the system  scheduling  priority  so
       that  group  IDs 324 and 76 would have a higher scheduling
       priority, if the user has the appropriate privileges to do
       so:  renice  -n  -4 -g 324 76 Adjust the system scheduling
       priority so that numeric user ID 8 and user sas would have
       a  lower  scheduling priority: renice -n 4 -u 8 sas Useful
       nice values on historical systems include 19  or  20  (the
       affected  processes will run only when nothing else in the
       system attempts to run), 0 (the base scheduling priority),
       and any negative number (to make processes run faster).
