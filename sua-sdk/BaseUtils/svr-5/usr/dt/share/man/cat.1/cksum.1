       cksum  calculates  the  32-bit  checksum of each file, and
       prints the result to stdout.  If  no  file  is  specified,
       cksum reads from stdin.

       For  each  file,  cksum  reads the file and calculates the
       checksum in a machine-independent  way,  then  prints  the
       checksum, number of bytes, and filename, each separated by
       a space.  The output is one line per file.  If  the  input
       is stdin, then the filename is not printed.

       If  an error is encountered, cksum will print a diagnostic
       message, skip the file in which the  error  occurred,  and
       continue  with the next file, returning a non-zero result.
       If no errors occur, the exit value will be zero.

       This command is a POSIX.2 command, and should be  used  in
       preference  to  the  old  System V alternative, sum, since
       cksum is both standard and more accurate.

       Like sum, the main purpose of this command  is  to  verify
       that  files  transferred  across a suspect medium are cor-
       rect, by comparing the results of cksum for the source and
       destination files.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
