       head  copies  the  first  number lines of each file to the
       standard output.  If no file is given, head  copies  lines
       from   the   standard  input.   The  environment  variable
       LC_CTYPE is referenced so that the codesets  used  in  the
       data  are  processed  correctly.  (See LANG on The default
       value of number is 10 lines.

       When more than one file is specified, the  start  of  each
       file will look like: ==>file<==

       Thus,  a common way to display a set of short files, iden-
       tifying each one, is: head -n 9999 file1 file2 ...

       The -number option has been made obsolete by POSIX. It  is
       recommended  that  application  authors  avoid  its use in
       favor of the -n number option.

       The length of the input lines  is  limited  to  {LINE_MAX}
       bytes.
