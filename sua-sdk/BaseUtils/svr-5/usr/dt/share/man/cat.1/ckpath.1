       ckpath  prompts  a  user  and  validates the response.  It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response  should  be  a  pathname, text for help and error
       messages, and a default value (which is  returned  if  the
       user responds with a ).

       The pathname must obey the criteria specified by the first
       group of options.  If no criteria are defined,  the  path-
       name  must  be  for a normal file that does not yet exist.
       If neither -a (absolute) or -l (relative) is  given,  then
       either is assumed to be valid.

       All  messages  are  limited in length to 70 characters and
       are formatted automatically.  Any white space used in  the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is  placed
       at  the  beginning  or  end  of  a message definition, the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If  the  prompt, help or error message is not defined, the
       default message (as defined  under  ``Notices'')  is  dis-
       played.

       Three  visual  tool  modules are linked to the ckpath com-
       mand.  They are errpath (which  formats  and  displays  an
       error  message),  helppath  (which  formats and displays a
       help message), and valpath (which validates  a  response).
       These  modules  should  be  used  in conjunction with FMLI
       objects.  In this instance, the FMLI  object  defines  the
       prompt.

       The  options  and  arguments  for this command are: Do not
       allow quit as a valid response.  Use  width  as  the  line
       length  for  prompt,  help,  and error messages.  Pathname
       must be an absolute path.  Pathname  must  be  a  relative
       path.  Pathname must be readable.  Pathname must be creat-
       able (touchable).  Pathname is  created  if  it  does  not
       already  exist.  Pathname must be writable.  Pathname must
       be executable.  The default value is default.  The default

                                                                1

       is  not  validated and so does not have to meet any crite-
       ria.  The help message is  help.   The  error  message  is
       error.  The prompt message is prompt.  Send process ID pid
       a signal if the user chooses to abort.  When quit is  cho-
       sen,  send signal to the process whose pid is specified by
       the -k option.  If no signal is  specified,  use  SIGTERM.
       Input to be verified against validation options.

       file_options  are:  Pathname must be a block special file.
       Pathname must be a character special file.  Pathname  must
       be  a  regular file.  Pathname must be a directory.  Path-
       name must not exist (must be new).   Pathname  must  exist
       (must  be  old).   Pathname  must  be a file with the size
       greater than 0 bytes.

       The following file_options are mutually exclusive:  -bcfy,
       -no, -nz, -bz, -cz.

       The text of the default messages for ckpath  depends  upon
       the  criteria  options  that  have  been used.  An example
       default prompt for ckpath (using the -a option) is:  Enter
       an  absolute  pathname [?,q] An example default error mes-
       sage (using the -a option) is: ERROR - Pathname must begin
       with  a  slash (/).  An example default help message is: A
       pathname is a filename, optionally preceded by parent
        directories. The pathname you enter: -- must contain 1 to
       NAME_MAX  characters  -- must not contain a spaces or spe-
       cial characters NAME_MAX is a system variable  defined  in
       limits.h.

       When  the  quit  option  is  chosen  (and  allowed),  q is
       returned along with the return code 3.  The valpath module
       does  not produce any output.  It returns zero for success
       and non-zero for failure.
