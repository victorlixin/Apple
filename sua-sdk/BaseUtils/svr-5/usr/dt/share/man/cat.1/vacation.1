       The  vacation command  makes it possible for you to notify
       the sender of a message that you are away on  a  trip  and
       you  will  not be answering your mail for some time.  runs
       vacation  on  your  behalf  rather  than  you  running  it
       directly.

       To  enable use of vacation, put the following line in your
       .maildelivery file: *    -    pipe    R     vacation  Make
       sure  that your .maildelivery file is not writable by any-
       one but you.  You may also place a ``custom''  reply  mes-
       sage in a file named tripnote.  Finally, you should create
       an empty triplog file.

       When vacation processes a message,  it  decides:  if  this
       type  of  message should receive a reply to whom the reply
       should be sent whether this sender has already received  a
       reply  The  vacation  command  decides whether this is the
       type of message that should get a reply by looking at  the
       contents of the Resent-To:, Resent-Cc:, To: and Cc: header
       fields.   If  the  recipient  has  an   .alter_egos   file
       (described  next),  then one of the addresses in that file
       must appear in one of these header fields for a  reply  to
       be  sent.  If  the  recipient does not have an .alter_egos
       file, then the recipient's name or a first-order  alias of
       the  recipient's  name  (for  example,  dlong-->long) must
       appear in one of these  header fields for a  reply  to  be
       sent.  This procedure ensures that vacation will not reply
       to messages sent to mailing lists, unless the  recipient's
       name  (or some variant of the recipient's name) is explic-
       itly mentioned in a header field.

       If vacation decides it should send a reply to the message,
       it  looks  at several other address fields to determine to
       whom the reply should be  sent.   It  uses,  in  order  of
       precedence:  addresses  in  Resent-Reply-To:  addresses in
       Resent-From: and, if present, Resent-Sender: addresses  in
       Reply-To:  addresses  in From: and either Sender:, if pre-
       sent, or the address argument from the command line.   The
       vacation  command  notifies any originator of mail who has
       not previously been notified  unless  you  pre-load  their
       address into the triplog file (refer to the ``Files'' sec-
       tion).  The reply begins with some standard text (supplied
       by vacation) followed by whatever text the user has placed
       in the tripnote file, or  the  following  message  if  the
       tripnote file is missing:
               This  is  an automatic reply to email you recently
       sent to $USER.  Additional mail to $USER will  not  result
       in  further  replies. This mail indicates that the user is
       not responding to your message for the following reason:

                                                                1

               No pre-recorded message file was left by the user.
       However,  this feature of the mail system is normally used
       during vacations and other extended absences.

       Contains  the  subject header for the mail vacation sends.
       The default subject is Absence  (Automatic  reply).   Con-
       tains  a  reply  message  to  be sent to those sending you
       mail.  Contains a list of each user  whose  mail  vacation
       responded  to.  It can also be initialized by hand to con-
       tain the addresses, one per line, that are not to  receive
       replies.  if it exists, becomes an output file for logging
       diagnostic information.  If the -d  option  is  specified,
       then extensive output is generated for debugging purposes.
       It is not a good idea to leave -d enabled if this file  is
       left lying around,  as the output can be quite voluminous.
       an optional file composed of ``user@domain'' lines for all
       addresses  to  be considered `you'.  This is needed if you
       have multiple hosts forwarding their mail to you.  If this
       file  is  present,  then  the standard comparisons against
       your username and first-level aliases of your username  do
       not occur.  is your mail delivery specification file.  The
       previous example shows the line that should  be  added  to
       .maildelivery  to enable use of vacation.  You may need to
       give the full pathname of vacation if it is  not  in  your
       search path.
