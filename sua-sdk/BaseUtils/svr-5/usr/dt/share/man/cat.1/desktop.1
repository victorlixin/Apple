       The desktop command initializes the UnixWare Desktop.   It
       is similar to the X Window System xinit command.

       The  desktop  command is used to start the X Window System
       server (X), the primary client  program  (dtm),  and  sec-
       ondary clients like dsdm and mwm.  When the primary client
       exits, desktop  will  kill  the  X  server  and  secondary
       clients  and then terminate.  If the X server exits, desk-
       top will kill the primary client and then terminate.

       Unless otherwise specified on the  command  line,  desktop
       assumes  that  there  are programs called X and dtm in the
       current search path.  It starts the  server  on  display 0
       and then runs dtm and secondary clients.

       An alternate primary client and/or server may be specified
       on the command line.  The desired client program  and  its
       arguments  should be given as the first command line argu-
       ments to desktop.  To specify a particular server  command
       line,  append  a double hyphen (--) to the desktop command
       line (after any client  and  arguments)  followed  by  the
       desired server command.

       A  relative or full pathname must be provided for the pri-
       mary client program and the  server  program.   Otherwise,
       they  are  treated  as  arguments  to be appended to their
       respective startup lines.  This makes it possible  to  add
       arguments  (for example, foreground and background colors)
       without having to retype the whole command line.

       If an explicit server name is  not  given  and  the  first
       argument  following  the  double dash (--) is a digit, the
       desktop program uses that number  as  the  display  number
       instead  of zero.  All remaining arguments are appended to
       the server command line.

       desktop also creates files called  .oliniterr  and  .olin-
       itout  and  places them in the user's home directory.  All
       errors and warnings are put in the .oliniterr file, if the
       Desktop is started using desktop (if started via graphical
       login, errors go to the file  /dev/X/xdm-errors).   Output
       to stdout is written out to the .olinitout file.

       using the Desktop Icon Setup mechanism are assumed to be X
       applications.   Other applications are assumed to be char-
       acter based and the system will create an xterm  for  each
       one  invoked.  Note that character based applications that
       use shell scripts that place processes in  the  background
       (for  example,  my_app  &)  behave as follows: An xterm is
       created and the shell script is executed from  the  xterm.
       The shell script invokes the process in the background and
       then exits.  xterm exits  because  the  shell  script  has
       exited.  The background process exits.

       Shell  scripts  should normally not place processes in the
       background.  However, if they do place  processes  in  the
       background,  they  should use the wait command to wait for
       child processes to complete.

       Typically you will use the desktop command to bring up the
       Desktop  when  you have disabled the graphical login using
       disable_glogin(1M) and have  previously  exited  from  the
       Desktop,  giving  you a shell prompt.  In addition, if you
       login to UnixWare with the argument DT=no after your ID at
       the  login  prompt,  you can later enter the Desktop using
       desktop.  For example: login: smith DT=no The above  login
       would give you the shell prompt on your console; the Desk-
       top would not start.

       The desktop command can only  be  used  for  starting  the
       server  and  clients  on  the same machine.  Using desktop
       with remote servers is not supported.

       Note also that you cannot edit your .Xdefaults file  while
       the  Desktop  is  running,  since the Desktop rewrites the
       file upon exiting.  You must edit it  before  the  Desktop
       has  started (for example, get a non-Desktop session using
       the DT=no argument to login as described above,  edit  the
       file, then use the desktop command).
