       col  reads  from  the  standard  input and writes onto the
       standard output.  It performs the line overlays implied by
       reverse  line feeds (ASCII code ESC-7), and by forward and
       reverse half-line-feeds (ESC-9 and ESC-8).  col is partic-
       ularly  useful  for filtering multicolumn output made with
       the .rt command of nroff and output resulting from use  of
       the preprocessor.

       If  the  -b  option  is given, col assumes that the output
       device in use is not  capable  of  backspacing.   In  this
       case,  if two or more characters are to appear in the same
       place, only the last one read will be output.

       Although col accepts half-line motions in  its  input,  it
       normally does not emit them on output.  Instead, text that
       would appear between lines is  moved  to  the  next  lower
       full-line  boundary.   This treatment can be suppressed by
       the -f (fine) option; in this case, the  output  from  col
       may  contain  forward  half-line-feeds  (ESC-9),  but will
       still never contain either kind of reverse line motion.

       Unless the -x option is  given,  col  will  convert  white
       space  to  tabs  on  output  wherever  possible to shorten
       printing time.

       The ASCII control characters SO (\017) and SI  (\016)  are
       assumed by col to start and end text in an alternate char-
       acter set.  The character set to which each input  charac-
       ter belongs is remembered, and on output SI and SO charac-
       ters are generated as  appropriate  to  ensure  that  each
       character is printed in the correct character set.

       On input, the only control characters processed are space,
       backspace, tab, return, new-line, SI, SO, VT  (\013),  and
       ESC followed by 7, 8, or 9.  The VT character is an alter-
       nate form of full reverse line-feed, included for compati-
       bility with some earlier programs of this type.  All other
       non-printing characters are ignored.

       Normally, col will ignore any escape sequences unknown  to
       it  that are found in its input; the -p option may be used
       to cause col to output these sequences as regular  charac-
       ters,  subject  to overprinting from reverse line motions.
       The use of this option is highly  discouraged  unless  the
       user  is fully aware of the textual position of the escape
       sequences.

       The input format accepted by col matches the  output  pro-
       duced  by nroff with either the -T37 or -Tlp options.  Use
       -T37 (and the -f option of col) if the  ultimate  disposi-
       tion of the output of col will be a device that can inter-
       pret half-line motions, and -Tlp otherwise.

       col cannot back up more than 128 lines or handle more than
       800 characters per line.

       Local  vertical  motions  that  would result in backing up
       over the first line of the document  are  ignored.   As  a
       result, the first line must not have any superscripts.
