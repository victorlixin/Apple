       The  last  command looks in the /var/adm/wtmpx, file which
       records all logins and logouts, for  information  about  a
       user,  a  terminal  or  any  group of users and terminals.
       Arguments specify names of users or terminals of interest.
       Names of terminals may be given fully or abbreviated.  For
       example last 10 is the same as last term/10.  If  multiple
       arguments  are given, the information which applies to any
       of the arguments is printed.  For example last  root  con-
       sole  lists all of root's sessions as well as all sessions
       on the console terminal.  last displays  the  sessions  of
       the  specified  users  and  terminals,  most recent first,
       indicating the times at which the session began, the dura-
       tion  of  the  session, and the terminal which the session
       took place on.  If the session is still continuing or  was
       cut short by a reboot, last so indicates.

       The  pseudo-user  reboot logs in at reboots of the system,
       thus last reboot will give  an  indication  of  mean  time
       between reboot.

       last with no arguments displays a record of all logins and
       logouts, in reverse order.

       If last is interrupted, it indicates how  far  the  search
       has  progressed  in /var/adm/wtmpx.  If interrupted with a
       quit signal (generated by a e) last indicates how far  the
       search has progressed so far, and the search continues.

       The  following  options are available: Limit the number of
       entries displayed to  that  specified  by  number.   These
       options are identical; the -number option is provided as a
       transition  tool  only  and  will  be  removed  in  future
       releases.   Use  file  as  the name of the accounting file
       instead of /var/adm/wtmpx.
