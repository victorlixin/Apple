       The  multihome  mailer  program  routes  mail addressed to
       users in virtual domains to the correct physical users  on
       the  system.  It does this by modifying the recipient list
       and resubmitting the message to

       The mail message to be routed is expected  to  be  on  the
       standard input.

       mailintro  also supports aliasing for each virtual domain.

       Address test mode. This outputs a new recipient list after
       performing aliasing and user mapping.  Debug mode. Similar
       to -t, but prints addresses at each stage of  the  lookup.
       When  using  these  options,  mailintro does not process a
       message from stdin.

       /var/internet/ip/127.0.0.1/virtusers

       Virtual user mapping file.  Maps  virtual  users  in  each
       domain to physical users.  This file is normally edited by
       the utility. Syntax for each line in  the  file  is:  vir-
       tuserid@virtdomain          realuserid         /var/inter-
       net/ip/127.0.0.1/virtusers.db

       This dbm database file contains a  hash  table  reflecting
       the virtusers text file.  This file is built automatically
       when the utility is used to update this file.  /var/inter-
       net/ip/127.0.0.1/mail/virtdomains

       A  local  cache  of  the valid virtual domains.  This file
       maps virtual  domains  to  IP  addresses.   This  file  is
       updated automatically by the utility.

       Syntax  for  each line in the file is: virtual_domain_name
       virtual_IP_address

       For  example:  machine.com  123.456.789.123.   /var/inter-
       net/ip/127.0.0.1/mail/virtdomains.db

       This  dbm  database  file contains a hash table reflecting
       the virtdomains file.  This file  is  built  automatically
       when the utility is used to update this file.  /var/inter-
       net/ip/x.x.x.x/mail/mail.aliases

       One of these files can  exist  for  each  virtual  domain.
       These files contain the aliasing information for each vir-
       tual domain.  These files are normally  updated  with  the
       utility.

                                                                1

multihome(1)                                         multihome(1)

       Syntax   for   each  line  in  the  file  is:  alias_name:
       comma_separated_alias_entries For example: alias1:  user1,
       user2.

       Note  that these alias files support :include: in the same
       manner as  standard  sendmail  alias  files.   /var/inter-
       net/ip/x.x.x.x/mail/mail.aliases.db

       This  dbm  database  file contains a hash table reflecting
       each mail.alias file.  These files are built automatically
       when  the  utility  is  used  to  update the corresponding
       mail.aliases file.
