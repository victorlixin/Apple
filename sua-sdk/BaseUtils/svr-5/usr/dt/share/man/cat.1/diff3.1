       diff3  compares  three  versions  of a file, and publishes
       disagreeing ranges of text flagged with these  codes:  all
       three  files  differ file1 is different file2 is different
       file3 is different

       The type of change suffered in converting a given range of
       a  given  file  to some other is indicated in one of these
       ways: Text is to be appended after line number n1 in  file
       f,  where  f  =  1, 2, or 3.  Text is to be changed in the
       range line n1 to line n2.  If n1 = n2, the  range  may  be
       abbreviated to n1.

       The  original  contents  of  the range follows immediately
       after a c indication.  When the contents of two files  are
       identical, the contents of the lower-numbered file is sup-
       pressed.  Produce a script for the editor that will incor-
       porate  into  file1  all  changes between file2 and file3,
       that is, the changes that normally would be  flagged  ====
       and  ====3.   Produce a script to incorporate only changes
       flagged  ====.   Produce  a  script  to  incorporate  only
       changes  flagged ====3.  Produce a script that will incor-
       porate all changes between  file2  and  file3,  but  treat
       overlapping  changes  (that  is,  changes  that  would  be
       flagged with ==== in the normal listing) differently.  The
       overlapping  lines from both files will be inserted by the
       edit script, bracketed by <<<<<< and >>>>>>  lines.   Pro-
       duce  a  script that will incorporate only changes flagged
       ====, but treat these changes in  the  manner  of  the  -E
       option.

       The  following  command will apply the resulting script to
       file1.  cat script; echo '1,$p') | ed - file1
