       atq  displays  the  current user's queue of jobs submitted
       with at to be run at a later date.  If invoked by a privi-
       leged user, atq will display all jobs in the queue.

       If no options are given, the jobs are displayed in chrono-
       logical order of execution.

       When a privileged  user  invokes  atq  without  specifying
       username,  the  entire queue is displayed; when a username
       is specified, only those jobs belonging to the named  user
       are displayed.

       The  atq  command  can be used with the following options:
       Display the queued jobs in the  order  they  were  created
       (that  is,  the time that the at command was given).  Dis-
       play only the total number of jobs currently in the queue.
