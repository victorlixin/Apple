       The  xtod command converts a file from  format to  format.
       The  files terminate a line of text with a carriage return
       and  a linefeed, while files terminate a line with a line-
       feed only.  Also  places a z at the end of a  file,  while
       does  not.   Some  programs and utilities are sensitive to
       this difference and some are not.  If a text or data  file
       is  not being interpreted correctly, use the dtox and xtod
       conversion utilities.  The xtod  command  adds  the  extra
       carriage  return to the end of each line and adds the z to
       the end of the file.  This utility  is  not  required  for
       converting binary object files.

       If  no  filename  is  specified  on the command line, xtod
       takes input from standard input.  Output  of  the  utility
       goes to standard output.
