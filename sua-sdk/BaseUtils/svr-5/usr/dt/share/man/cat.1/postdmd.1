       postdmd translates DMD bitmap files, as produced by dmdps,
       or files written in the Ninth Edition bitfile format  into
       PostScript  and writes the results on the standard output.
       If no files are specified, or if - is  one  of  the  input
       files,  the standard input is read.  The following options
       are understood: Pack the bitmap in the output  file  using
       num  byte patterns.  A value of 0 turns off all packing of
       the output file.  By default, num is 6.  Print num  copies
       of  each page.  By default only one copy is printed.  Flip
       the sense  of  the  bits  in  files  before  printing  the
       bitmaps.   Magnify  each  logical  page by the factor num.
       Pages are scaled uniformly  about  the  origin,  which  by
       default  is  located  at  the  center  of  each page.  The
       default magnification is 1.0.  Print num logical pages  on
       each  piece  of paper, where num can be any positive inte-
       ger.  By default num is set to 1.  Print pages whose  num-
       bers are given in the comma-separated list.  The list con-
       tains single numbers N and ranges N1 - N2.  A  missing  N1
       means  the  lowest  numbered  page, a missing N2 means the
       highest.  Print files  in  either  portrait  or  landscape
       mode.   Only  the  first character of mode is significant.
       The default mode is portrait.  Translate  the  origin  num
       inches  along the positive x axis.  The default coordinate
       system has the origin fixed at the  center  of  the  page,
       with  positive  x to the right and positive y up the page.
       Positive num moves everything right.  The  default  offset
       is  0  inches.   Translate the origin num inches along the
       positive y axis.  Positive num  moves  everything  up  the
       page.  The default offset is 0.

       Only  one bitmap is printed on each logical page, and each
       of the input files must contain complete  descriptions  of
       at  least  one  bitmap.  Decreasing the pattern size using
       the -b option may help throughput on  printers  with  fast
       processors (such as PS-810s), while increasing the pattern
       size will often be the right move on older models (such as
       PS-800s).

       An exit status of 0 is returned if files were successfully
       processed.
