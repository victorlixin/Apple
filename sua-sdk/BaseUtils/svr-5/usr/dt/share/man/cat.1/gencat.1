       The  gencat utility merges the message text source file(s)
       msgfile into a formatted message  database  catfile.   The
       database  catfile  will  be created if it does not already
       exist.   If  catfile  does  exist  its  messages  will  be
       included  in  the new catfile.  If set and message numbers
       collide, the new  message-text  defined  in  msgfile  will
       replace  the  old message text currently contained in cat-
       file.

       If - is used for catfile, then gencat writes  the  message
       catalog  file  to  standard output.  If - is used for msg-
       file, then gencat reads the message text source from stan-
       dard input.

       The  message  text  source file (or set of files) input to
       gencat can contain either set and message numbers or  sim-
       ply message numbers, in which case the set NL_SETD [see is
       assumed.  If msgfile is not specified,  gencat  will  read
       from stdin.

       The  -l  option lists messages to standard output.  The -m
       option  specifies  ``malloc''-format  messages.   The   -X
       option is the same as -m.

       The  -f option allows different format message catalogs to
       be generated.  Arguments that can be used with this option
       are: Produce the System V Release 4 format catalog.  (This
       is the default if -f or -m are not  specified.)   This  is
       equivalent  to  the -m option.  This is the default if the
       POSIX2 environment variable is set.  Produce message cata-
       logs suitable for use with / applications.

       If  the  -m  or  -f options are not used, the format of an
       existing message catalog will be retained.  The -f  option
       can be used to change the format of a catalog.

       The  format  of  a  message text source file is defined as
       follows.  The fields of a message  text  source  line  are
       separated  by  a  single ASCII space or tab character. Any
       other ASCII spaces or tabs are considered as being part of
       the  subsequent  field.  n specifies the set identifier of
       the following messages until the next  $set,  $delset,  or
       end-of-file  appears.  n must be  a number in the range (1
       to NL_SETMAX).  Set identifiers  within  a  single  source
       file need not be contiguous.  Any string following the set
       identifier is treated as a comment.  If no $set  directive
       is  specified  in a message text source file, all messages
       will be  located  in  the  default  message  set  NL_SETD.
       Delete  message  set  n  from an existing message catalog.
       Any string following  the  set  number  is  treated  as  a

                                                                1

gencat(1)                                               gencat(1)

       comment.  (If n is not a valid set it is ignored.)  A line
       beginning with a dollar symbol  $  followed  by  an  ASCII
       space  or  tab  character  is treated as a comment.  The m
       denotes the message identifier, which is a number  in  the
       range (1 to NL_MSGMAX).  The message-text is stored in the
       message catalog with the set identifier specified  by  the
       last  $set  directive,  and with message identifier m.  If
       the message-text is empty, and an ASCII space or tab field
       separator  is  present,  an  empty string is stored in the
       message catalog.  If a message source line has  a  message
       number,  but  neither  a field separator nor message-text,
       the existing message with that number (if any) is  deleted
       from  the  catalog.   Message identifiers need not be con-
       tiguous.  The length of message-text must be in the  range
       (0  to NL_TEXTMAX).  This line specifies an optional quote
       character c, which can be used to surround message-text so
       that  trailing spaces or null (empty) messages are visible
       in a message source line.  By  default,  or  if  an  empty
       $quote  directive  is supplied, no quoting of message-text
       will be recognized.

       Empty lines in a message text source file are ignored.

       Text strings can contain the special characters and escape
       sequences defined in the following table:
       ------------------------------------------
        Description         Symbol     Sequence
       ------------------------------------------
        newline             NL(LF)     \n
        horizontal tab      HT         \t
        vertical tab        VT         \v
        backspace           BS         \b
        carriage return     CR         \r
        form feed           FF         \f
        backslash           \          \\
        bit pattern         ddd        \ddd

       The escape sequence \ddd consists of backslash followed by
       1, 2 or 3 octal digits, which are  taken  to  specify  the
       value  of the desired character.  If the character follow-
       ing a backslash is not one of those specified,  the  back-
       slash is ignored.

       Backslash  followed  by an ASCII newline character is also
       used to continue a string on the  following  line.   Thus,
       the  following two lines describe a single message string:
       1 This line continues \ to the next line

       which is equivalent to: 1 This line continues to the  next
       line

       This  version  of  gencat  is built on the mkmsgs utility.
       The gencat database comprises two files: catfile.m,  which

                                                                2

gencat(1)                                               gencat(1)

       is  a catalog in mkmsgs format and the file catfile, which
       contains the information required to translate a  set  and
       message  number  into a simple message number which can be
       used in a call to gettxt.

       Using gettxt constrains the catalogs to be  located  in  a
       subdirectory  under  /usr/lib/locale.  This restriction is
       lifted by placing only a symbolic link to the  catalog  in
       the  directory  /usr/lib/locale/Xopen/LC_MESSAGES when the
       catalog is opened.  It is this link that gettxt uses  when
       attempting to access the catalog.

       The  link is removed when the catalog is closed, but occa-
       sionally as applications exit abnormally  without  closing
       catalogs  redundant  symbolic  links  will  be left in the
       directory.

       For compatibility with previous version of gencat released
       in  a number of specialized internationalization products,
       the -m option is supplied.  This option causes  gencat  to
       build  a  single  file catfile that is compatible with the
       format catalogs produced by  the  earlier  versions.   The
       retrieval  routines  detect  the  type of catalog they are
       using and act appropriately.
