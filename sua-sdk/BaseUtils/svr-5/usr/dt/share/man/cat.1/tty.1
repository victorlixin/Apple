       tty  prints  the  pathname  of  the  user's  terminal.  It
       accepts the following options: Print the synchronous  line
       number to which the user's terminal is connected, if it is
       on an active synchronous line.  Inhibit  printing  of  the
       terminal  path  name,  allowing  one to test just the exit
