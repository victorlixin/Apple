       ipcs  prints information about active inter-process commu-
       nication facilities.

       Note that information is displayed  only  for  objects  to
       which the user has read access.

       A user with the appropriate privileges is able to override
       the read access restriction and display information on all
       objects.

       Note  that  options that apply to shared memory also apply
       to dynamic shared memory.

       Without options, information is printed  in  short  format
       for message queues, shared memory, and semaphores that are
       currently active in the system.  Otherwise,  the  informa-
       tion  that  is  displayed  is  controlled by the following
       options: Print information about  active  message  queues.
       Print  information  about  active  shared memory segments.
       Print information about active semaphores.  Print informa-
       tion about dynamic shared memory segments.

       If  -q, -m, -s or -d are specified, information about only
       those indicated is printed.  If none  of  these  four  are
       specified,  information  about all four is printed subject
       to these options: Print information on  maximum  allowable
       size.   (Maximum  number of bytes in messages on queue for
       message queues, size of segments for  shared  memory,  and
       number  of  semaphores  in  each set for semaphores.)  See
       below for meaning of columns in  a  listing.   Print  cre-
       ator's  login  name  and  group  name.   See below.  Print
       information on outstanding usage.  (Number of messages  on
       queue  and  total number of bytes in messages on queue for
       message queues and number of processes attached to  shared
       memory   segments.)   Print  process  number  information.
       (Process ID of last process to send a message, process  ID
       of  last  process  to receive a message on message queues,
       process ID of creating process, and  process  ID  of  last
       process  to attach or detach on dynamic and regular shared
       memory segments.)  See  below.   Print  time  information.
       (Time  of  the  last  control  operation  that changed the
       access permissions for all facilities, time of last msgsnd
       and  msgrcv  operations  on  message  queues, time of last
       shmat and shmdt operations on shared memory, and  time  of
       last  semop operation on semaphores.)  See below.  Use all
       print options.  (This is a shorthand notation for -b,  
       -o, -p, -t.)  Use the file corefile in place of /dev/kmem.
       Use the file namelist in place of /stand/unix.

       ipcs  listing  are given below; the letters in parentheses
       indicate the options that cause the corresponding  heading
       to  appear;  all  means  that  the heading always appears.
       Note that these options only determine what information is
       provided  for  each  facility; they do not determine which
       facilities are listed.  Type of  facility:  message  queue
       shared   memory  segment  dynamic  shared  memory  segment
       semaphore The identifier for the facility entry.  The  key
       used as an argument to msgget, semget, shmget, or dshm_get
       to create the facility entry.  The key of a shared  memory
       segment  is  changed  to  IPC_PRIVATE when the segment has
       been removed until all processes attached to  the  segment
       detach it.  The facility access modes and flags.  The mode
       consists of 11 characters that are interpreted as follows:

       The  first  character  is:  if  a  process is waiting on a
       msgsnd operation.  if the above is not true.   The  second
       character  is:  if a process is waiting on a msgrcv opera-
       tion.  if the above is not true.  The next nine characters
       are  interpreted  as  three  sets of three bits each.  The
       first set refers to the owner's permissions; the  next  to
       permissions  of  others  in the user-group of the facility
       entry; and the last to all others.  Within each  set,  the
       first  character  indicates permission to read, the second
       character indicates  permission  to  write  or  alter  the
       facility  entry,  and  the  last  character  is  currently
       unused.

       The permissions are indicated as follows: if read  permis-
       sion  is  granted.   if  write  permission is granted.  if
       alter permission is granted.  if the indicated  permission
       is not granted.  The login name of the owner of the facil-
       ity entry.  The group name of the owner  of  the  facility
       entry.   The  login  name  of  the creator of the facility
       entry.  The group name of  the  creator  of  the  facility
       entry.   The  number  of  bytes in messages currently out-
       standing on the associated message queue.  The  number  of
       messages  currently  outstanding on the associated message
       queue.  The maximum number of bytes  allowed  in  messages
       outstanding  on the associated message queue.  The process
       ID of the last process to send a message to the associated
       queue.   The  process  ID of the last process to receive a
       message from the associated queue.  The time the last mes-
       sage  was sent to the associated queue.  The time the last
       message was received from the associated queue.  The  time
       the  associated  entry was created or changed.  The number
       of processes attached to the associated shared memory seg-
       ment.   The  size of the associated shared memory segment.
       The process ID of the creator of the shared memory  entry.
       The process ID of the last process to attach or detach the
       shared memory segment.  The time the last  attach  on  the
       associated  shared memory segment was completed.  The time
       the last detach on the associated  shared  memory  segment
       was  completed.   The  number  of  semaphores  in  the set

                                                                2

       semaphore   operation  on  the  set  associated  with  the
       semaphore entry was completed.

       Things can change while ipcs is running;  the  information
