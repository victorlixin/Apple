       factor [integer]

       When  you use factor without an argument, it waits for you
       to give it an integer.  After you give it a positive inte-
       ger  less  than  1014,  it factors the integer, prints its
       prime factors the proper number of times, and  then  waits
       for another integer.  factor exits if it encounters a zero
       or any non-numeric character.

       If you invoke factor with  an  argument,  it  factors  the
       integer as described above, and then it exits.

       The  maximum  time to factor an integer is proportional to
       \/(n).  factor will take this time when n is prime or  the
       square of a prime.
