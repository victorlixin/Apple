       who  can  list the user's name, terminal line, login time,
       elapsed time since activity occurred on the line, and  the
       process  ID  of  the  command interpreter (shell) for each
       current  system user.  It examines the -5/var/adm/utmp  file
       to  obtain  its  information.  If file is given, that file
       (which must be in format) is examined.  Usually, file will
       be  -5/var/adm/wtmp,  which  contains  a  history of all the
       logins since the file was last created.

       who with the am i or am I option identifies  the  invoking
       user.

       The  general  format for output is: name [state] line time
       [idle] [pid] [comment] [exit] The  name,  line,  and  time
       information  is  produced  by  all  options except -q; the
       state information is produced only by -T; the idle and pid
       information  is  produced  only by -u, -l, and -T; and the
       comment and exit information is produced only by -a.   The
       information  produced for -p, -d, and -r is explained dur-
       ing the discussion of each option, below.

       With options, who can list logins, logoffs,  reboots,  and
       changes  to  the  system clock, as well as other processes
       spawned by the init  process.   These  options  are:  This
       option lists only those users who are currently logged in.
       The name is the user's login name.  The line is  the  name
       of  the  line as found in the directory /dev.  The time is
       the time that the user logged in.  The  idle  column  con-
       tains  the number of hours and minutes since activity last
       occurred on that particular line.  A  dot  (``.'')   indi-
       cates  that  the  terminal  has  seen activity in the last
       minute and is therefore ``current.''  If more than twenty-
       four  hours  have  elapsed  or  the line has not been used
       since boot time, the entry is marked old.  This  field  is
       useful  when trying to determine whether a person is work-
       ing at the terminal or not.  The pid is the process ID  of
       the  user's shell.  The comment is the comment field asso-
       ciated with this line as found in -5/etc/inittab  (see  This
       can  contain  information  about  where  the  terminal  is
       located, the telephone number of the dataset, type of ter-
       minal  if  hard-wired, and so on.  This option is the same
       as the -u option, except that the state  of  the  terminal
       line is printed.  The state describes whether someone else
       can write to  that  terminal.   A  ``+''  appears  if  the

                                                                1

       terminal  is  writable by anyone; a ``-'' appears if it is
       not.  root can write to all lines  having  a  ``+''  or  a
       ``-'' in the state field.  If a bad line is encountered, a
       ``?''  is printed.  This option lists those lines on which
       the  system  is  waiting  for  someone to login.  The name
       field is LOGIN in such cases.  Other fields are  the  same
       as  for  user entries except that the state field does not
       exist.  If the environment variable  POSIX2  is  not  set,
       running port monitors are also listed (-L).  List all run-
       ning port monitors.  Like who am i  ,  this  option  lists
       information for the invoking user only.  who -m is equiva-
       lent to who am i , with the exception that -m can be  used
       in conjunction with other options.  This option will print
       column headings above the regular output.  This is a quick
       who,  displaying  only  the  names and the number of users
       currently logged on.  When this option is used, all  other
       options  except  -n  are  ignored.   This option lists any
       other process which is currently active and has been  pre-
       viously  spawned  by  init.  The name field is the name of
       the program executed by init  as  found  in  -5/etc/inittab.
       The  state,  line,  and  idle fields have no meaning.  The
       comment  field  shows  the  id  field  of  the  line  from
       -5/etc/inittab  that  spawned this process.  See This option
       displays processes that have expired  and  have  not  been
       respawned  by  init.  These include processes for lines on
       which the user has logged out.  The exit field appears for
       dead  processes and contains the termination and exit val-
       ues (as returned by of the dead process.  This can be use-
       ful  in  determining  why  a process terminated.  The utmp
       entry for a dead process remains only until the utmp entry
       is  used  for  another process.  This option indicates the
       time and date of the last reboot.  This option  shows  the
       current run-level of the init process, the number of times
       previously in that  run-level,  and  the  prior  run-level
       under  the  idle, pid, and comment headings, respectively.
       This option indicates the last change to the system  clock
       (via  the  date command) by root See This option processes
       -5/var/adm/utmp  or  the  named  file  with  the  -ulpdbrtTH
       options  turned  on.  This option is the default and lists
       only the name, line, and time fields.  This option takes a
       numeric  argument,  x, which specifies the number of users
       to display per line.  x must be at least 1.  The -n option
       is ignored except when used with -q.
