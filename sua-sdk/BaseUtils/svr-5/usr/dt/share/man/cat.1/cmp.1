       The  two files are compared.  (If either file1 or file2 is
       -, the standard input is used.)   Under  default  options,
       cmp  makes  no  comment if the files are the same; if they
       differ, it announces the byte and line number at which the
       difference  occurred.   If  one  file is an initial subse-
       quence of the other, that fact is noted.  skip1 and  skip2
       are  initial  byte  offsets  into  file1 and file2 respec-
       tively, and may be either octal or decimal;  the  form  of
       the  number  is  determined  by  the  environment variable
       LC_NUMERIC (in the C locale, a leading 0 denotes an  octal
       number).  (See LANG on and

       Print  the  byte  number (decimal) and the differing bytes
       (octal) for each difference.  Print nothing for  differing
       files; return codes only.

       On  detecting  end  of  file,  cmp prints the following to
       standard error: UX:cmp: INFO: EOF on  file  If  POSIX2  is
       set,  the  diagnostic  message  on end of file is instead:
       cmp: EOF on file

       Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for differ-
