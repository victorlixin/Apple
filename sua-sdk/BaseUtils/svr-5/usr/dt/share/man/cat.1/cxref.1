       The  cxref  command  analyzes  a collection of C files and
       builds a cross-reference table.  cxref uses a special ver-
       sion  of cc to include #define'd information in its symbol
       table.  It generates a list of all symbols (auto,  static,
       and  global)  in  each  individual  file,  or, with the -c
       option, in combination.  The table includes  four  fields:
       NAME,  FILE, FUNCTION, and LINE.  The line numbers appear-
       ing in the LINE field also show reference marks as  appro-
       priate.  The reference marks include: = - (**

       If  no  reference  marks  appear, you can assume a general
       reference.

       cxref processes supplementary code set characters  accord-
       ing  to  the  locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment
       variable (see LANG on

       The -D, -I, -Kdollar and -U options are interpreted as  by
       cc.   In addition, cxref interprets the following options:
       Combine the source files into a  single  report.   Without
       the  -c option, cxref generates a separate report for each
       file on the command line.  Disables printing declarations,
       making  the  report  easier to read.  Does not print local
       variables; prints only global and file  scope  statistics.
       Direct  output to file.  Operates silently; does not print
       input file names.  Format  listing  for  80-column  width.
       Width  option that formats output no wider than num (deci-
       mal) columns.  This option will default to 80  if  num  is
       not  specified  or  is  less than 51.  Runs only the first
       pass of cxref, creating a  .cx  file  that  can  later  be
       passed  to  cxref.  This is similar to the -c option of cc
       or lint.  Prints the full  path  of  the  referenced  file
       names.   Modifies  the number of table columns in the LINE
       field.  If you do not specify a number, cxref defaults  to
       five  columns.  Prints version information on the standard
       error.  Changes the default width of at least  one  field.
       The default widths are:
       -----------------------------------
       Field      Columns
       -----------------------------------
       NAME       15
       FILE       13
       FUNCTION   15
       LINE       20 (4 per table column)

       Error  messages usually mean you cannot compile the files.
