       logger saves all the string arguments to a log file so the
       system administrator can later read them.  Note  that  the
       string  arguments  are  treated as normal arguments by the
       shell, and may need quoting to avoid expansion.

       Each string is written to the log, separated by  a  single
       space.   The  list  of  strings are preceded by the string
       ``UX:logger:INFO:''.

       No output is written to stdout.

       If the log file cannot be opened, logger writes a diagnos-
       tic message to stderr and terminates with a non-zero  exit
       value.

       preference to the BSD version of logger.
