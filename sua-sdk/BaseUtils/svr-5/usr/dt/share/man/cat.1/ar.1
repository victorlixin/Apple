       The  ar  command maintains groups of files combined into a
       single archive file.  Its main use is to create and update
       library  files.   However,  it can be used for any similar
       purpose.  If an archive is composed  of  printable  files,
       the entire archive is printable.

       When ar creates an archive, it creates headers in a format
       that is portable across all machines.  The archive  symbol
       table  (described  in  is  used  by  the link editor ld to
       effect multiple passes over libraries of object  files  in
       an efficient manner.  An archive symbol table is only cre-
       ated and maintained by ar  when  there  is  at  least  one
       object  file  in the archive.  The archive symbol table is
       in a specially named file that is always the first file in
       the  archive.   This file is never mentioned or accessible
       to the user.  Whenever the ar command is used to create or
       update  the  contents of such an archive, the symbol table
       is rebuilt.  The s argument to key, described below,  will
       force  the  symbol table to be rebuilt.  Cause ar to print
       its version number on standard error.  key is formed  with
       one  of  the following characters: drqtpmx.  arg is formed
       with one of more of the following letters: vucs.  An addi-
       tional  single-character argument to key, called the posi-
       tioning character (chosen from one of the  following  let-
       ters:  abi), can be used with key characters r and m.  key
       characters are described below.  Archive member name  used
       as  a  reference  point  in positioning other files in the
       archive.  Archive file.  One or more constituent files  in
       the archive file.

       The  meanings of the key characters are as follows: Delete
       the named files from the archive  file.   Move  the  named
       files to the end of the archive.  If an optional position-
       ing character from the set abi is used, the posname  argu-
       ment  must  be present and specifies that new files are to
       be placed after a or before b or i posname.  Otherwise new
       files are placed at the end.  Print the named files in the
       archive.  Quickly append the named files to the end of the
       archive   file.    Optional   positioning  characters  are
       invalid.  The command does not  check  whether  the  added
       members are already in the archive.  This option is useful
       to avoid creating a large archive piece-by-piece.  Replace
       the  named  files  in  the  archive file.  If the optional
       argument u is used with r, replace only those  files  with
       dates  of  modification later than the named files already
       in the archive.  If an optional positioning character from
       the  set abi is used, the posname argument must be present
       and specifies that new files are to be placed after  a  or
       before  b or i posname.  Otherwise new files are placed at
       the end.  Print a table of contents of the  archive  file.

                                                                1

ar(1)                                                       ar(1)

       If  no  names  are  given,  all  files  in the archive are
       listed.  If names are given, only those files are  listed.
       Update  older  files.  When used with the -r option, files
       within the archive are replaced only if the  corresponding
       file  has  a  modification time that is at least as new as
       the modification time of  the  file  within  the  archive.
       Extract the named files.  If no names are given, all files
       in the archive are extracted.   In  neither  case  does  x
       alter the archive file.

       The  meanings  of  the other key arguments are as follows:
       Give a verbose file-by-file description of the making of a
       new  archive file from the old archive and the constituent
       files.  When used with the -t option, give a long  listing
       of  all information about the files.  When used with x, d,
       or r, print the name of the file  preceding  each  extrac-
       tion.   When  used with p, write the file to standard out-
       put.  Suppress the message that  is  produced  by  default
       when  afile  is  created.   Force  the regeneration of the
       archive symbol table even if ar is not invoked with a com-
       mand which will modify the archive contents.  This command
       is useful to restore the archive symbol  table  after  the
       command has been used on the archive.

       If  the  same file is mentioned twice in an argument list,
       it may be put in the archive twice.

       Since the archiver no longer uses temporary files, the  -l
       option  is  obsolete  and  will  be  removed  in  the next
       release.

       By convention, archives are suffixed with  the  characters
       .a.

       Applications  currently  using options without the leading
       hyphen must be changed to use the hyphen since non-hyphen-
       ated options may not be supported in a future release.
