       The kbdpipe command  allows  the  use  of  kbd  tables  as
       pipeline  elements  between  user  programs.  (See and for
       descriptions of the module and its capabilities.)  kbdpipe
       is useful in code set conversion applications.  If an out-
       put file is specified, then all infiles are piped to  that
       output  file.   With  no arguments other than -t, standard
       input is converted and sent to standard output.

       The required option argument -t identifies the table to be
       used for conversion.  If the table has already been loaded
       as a shared table (see it is attached.  If,  however,  the
       table  has not been loaded, an attempt is made to load it.
       If the specified table name is not  an  absolute  pathname
       then  the  name of the system mapping library is prepended
       to the argument, and an attempt is made to load the  table
       from  the resulting pathname (that is, it becomes an argu-
       ment to the loader, kbdload).  Assuming the table  can  be
       loaded, it is attached.

       The  argument  to -f defines the file from which the table
       will be loaded, overriding the  default  action  described
       above.   The  file  is  loaded  (in its entirety), and the
       named table attached.  This option should be used  if  the
       default action would fail.

       The  output file specified by -o must not already exist (a
       safety feature).  The option -F may be  used  to  override
       the  check for existence of the output file; in this case,
       any existing outfile will be truncated before being  writ-
       ten.

       The  following example converts two input files into rela-
       tive nonsense by mapping ASCII into Dvorak keyboard equiv-
       alents  using  the  Dvorak table.  The table is assumed to
       reside in the file /usr/lib/kbd/Dvorak.  The existing out-
       put file is overwritten: kbdpipe -F -t Dvorak -o iapxai.vj
       file1 file2

       The following example loads the Dvorak table from  a  dif-
       ferent file, then converts standard input to standard out-
       put.  The Dvorak table (assumed  to  be  non-resident)  is
       explicitly  loaded  from an absolute path beginning at the
       user's   home   directory:   kbdpipe    -t    Dvorak    -f
       $HOME/tables/Dvorak.tab

       Because kbdpipe uses to load  tables,  it  cannot  resolve
       link references.  Therefore, if a composite table is used,
       the relevant portions must either be  already  loaded  and
       public,  or  be  contained  in  the  file used (via the -f
       option) on the command line.  In the latter case, the com-
       posite  elements  must  be  loaded  earlier  than the link
       entry.

       Users may use kbd tables in  programs  at  user  level  by
       opening  a  pipe,  pushing  the  module,  and  setting via
       related commands.  Therefore, there is no need to use  the
       kbdpipe  command.   kbdpipe may not be supported in future
       releases.
