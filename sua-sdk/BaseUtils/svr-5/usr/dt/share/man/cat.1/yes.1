       yes  repeatedly outputs ``y'', or if a single string argu-
       ment is given, string is output repeatedly.   The  command
       continues  indefinitely  unless aborted.  yes is useful in
       pipes to commands that prompt  for  input  and  require  a
       ``y''  response  for  a yes.  In this case, yes terminates
       when the command that it pipes to terminates  so  that  no
       infinite loop occurs.
