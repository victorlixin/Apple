       ckdate prompts a user  and  validates  the  response.   It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response should be a date, text for help  and  error  mes-
       sages,  and a default value (which is returned if the user
       responds with a ).   The  user  response  must  match  the
       defined format for a date.

       All  messages  are  limited in length to 70 characters and
       are formatted automatically.  Any white space used in  the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is  placed
       at  the  beginning  or  end  of  a message definition, the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If  the  prompt, help or error message is not defined, the
       default message (as defined  under  ``Notices'')  is  dis-
       played.

       Three  visual  tool  modules are linked to the ckdate com-
       mand.  They are errdate (which  formats  and  displays  an
       error  message),  helpdate  (which  formats and displays a
       help message), and valdate (which validates  a  response).
       These  modules  should  be  used  in conjunction with FMLI
       objects.  In this instance, the FMLI  object  defines  the
       prompt.   When  format is defined in the errdate and help-
       date modules, the messages describe the expected format.

       The options and arguments for this  command  are:  Do  not
       allow  quit  as  a valid response..  Use width as the line
       length for prompt, help, and error messages.  Verify input
       using format.  Possible formats and their definitions are:
       abbreviated month name (for example, jan, feb,  mar)  full
       month  name  day  of month (01 - 31) date as %m/%d/%y (the
       default format) day of month (1 - 31;  single  digits  are
       preceded  by  a blank) abbreviated month name (same as %b)
       month number (01 - 12) year within century  (for  example,
       91)  year as CCYY (for example, 1991) The default value is
       default.  The default is not validated  and  so  does  not
       have to meet any criteria.  The help message is help.  The
       error message is error.  The  prompt  message  is  prompt.
       Send process ID pid a signal if the user chooses to abort.
       When quit is chosen, send signal to the process whose  pid

                                                                1

       use SIGTERM.  Input to be verified against  format  crite-

       The default prompt for ckdate is: Enter the date [?,q] The
       default  error  message  is:  ERROR - Please enter a date.
       Format is format.  The default  help  message  is:  Please
       enter  a  date. Format is format.  When the quit option is
       chosen (and allowed), q is returned along with the  return
       code  3.   The valdate module does not produce any output.
       It returns zero for success and non-zero for failure.
