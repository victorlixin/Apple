       env obtains the current environment, modifies it according
       to its arguments, then executes the command with the modi-
       fied  environment.   Arguments  of the form name=value are
       merged into the inherited environment before  the  command
       is  executed.   The  -  or  -i option causes the inherited
       environment to be ignored completely, so that the  command
       is  executed with exactly the environment specified by the
       arguments.  If no  command  is  specified,  the  resulting
       environment is printed, one name-value pair per line.

       env recognizes supplementary code set characters in value,
       command, and args according to the locale specified in the
       LC_CTYPE environment variable (see LANG on

       If  the  Application  Compatibility  Package is installed,
       then printenv replaces env.
