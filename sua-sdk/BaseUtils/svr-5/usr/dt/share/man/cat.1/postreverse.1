       The  postreverse  filter  reverses the page order in files
       that conform to Adobe's Version 1.0 or  Version  2.0  file
       structuring  conventions,  and  writes  the results on the
       standard output.  Only one input file is allowed and if no
       file  is  specified, the standard input is read.  The fol-
       lowing options are understood: Select pages whose  numbers
       are  given in the comma-separated list.  The list contains
       single numbers N and ranges N1 - N2.  A missing  N1  means
       the  lowest numbered page, a missing N2 means the highest.
       Don't reverse the pages in file.

       The postreverse filter can handle a limited class of files
       that  violate page independence, provided all global defi-
       nitions are bracketed  by  %%BeginGlobal  and  %%EndGlobal
       comments.   In  addition,  files that mark the end of each
       page with %%EndPage:  label  ordinal  comments  will  also
       reverse  properly,  provided the prologue and trailer sec-
       tions can be located.  If postreverse  fails  to  find  an
       %%EndProlog  or  %%EndSetup  comment,  the  entire file is
       copied, unmodified, to the standard output.

       Because global definitions are extracted  from  individual
       pages and put in the prologue, the output file can be min-
       imally conforming, even if the input file was not.

       An exit status of 0 is returned if file  was  successfully
       processed.

       No  attempt  has  been  made to deal with redefinitions of
       global variables or  procedures.   If  standard  input  is
       used, the input file will be read three times before being
       reversed.

       To select pages 1 to 100 from file and reverse the  pages:
       postreverse -o1-100 file

       To  print  four  logical  pages  on each physical page and
       reverse all the pages: postprint -n4 file | postreverse

       To produce a minimally conforming file from output  gener-
       ated  by  dpost  without reversing the pages: dpost file |
       postreverse -r

                                                                1
