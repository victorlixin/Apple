       The  input  is one or more object or library archive files
       (see If file is -, standard input is used.   The  standard
       output is a list of pairs of object file or archive member
       names; the first file of the pair refers to external iden-
       tifiers  defined  in  the  second.  The output may be pro-
       cessed by to find an ordering of a  library  suitable  for
       one-pass  access  by  ld.  Note that the link editor ld is
       capable of multiple passes over an archive in the portable
       archive  format  (see  and does not require that lorder be
       used when building an archive.  The usage  of  the  lorder
       command may, however, allow for a more efficient access of
       the archive during the link edit process.

       The following example builds a new library  from  existing
       .o files: ar -cr library 'lorder *.o | tsort'

       lorder  will  accept  as input any object or archive file,
       regardless of its suffix, provided there is more than  one
       input file.  If there is but a single input file, its suf-
       fix must be .o.
