       cktime prompts a user  and  validates  the  response.   It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response should be a time, text for help  and  error  mes-
       sages,  and a default value (which is returned if the user
       responds with a ).   The  user  response  must  match  the
       defined format for the time of day.

       All  messages  are  limited in length to 70 characters and
       are formatted automatically.  Any white space used in  the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is  placed
       at  the  beginning  or  end  of  a message definition, the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If  the  prompt, help or error message is not defined, the
       default message (as defined  under  ``Notices'')  is  dis-
       played.

       Three  visual  tool  modules are linked to the cktime com-
       mand.  They are errtime (which  formats  and  displays  an
       error  message),  helptime  (which  formats and displays a
       help message), and valtime (which validates  a  response).
       These  modules  should  be  used  in conjunction with FMLI
       objects.  In this instance, the FMLI  object  defines  the
       prompt.   When  format is defined in the errtime and help-
       time modules, the messages describe the expected format.

       The options and arguments for this  command  are:  Do  not
       allow  quit  as  a  valid response.  Use width as the line
       length for prompt, help, and error messages.   Verify  the
       input  against format.  Possible formats and their defini-
       tions are: hour (00 - 23) hour (00 - 12) minute (00 -  59)
       ante meridian or post meridian time as %I:%M:%S %p time as
       %H:%M (the default format)  seconds  (00  -  59)  time  as
       %H:%M:%S The default value is default.  The default is not
       validated and so does not have to meet any criteria.   The
       help  message  is  help.  The error message is error.  The
       prompt message is prompt.  Send process ID pid a signal if
       the user chooses to abort.  When quit is chosen, send sig-
       nal to the process  whose  pid  is  specified  by  the  -k
       option.  If no signal is specified, use SIGTERM.  Input to
       be verified against format criteria.

                                                                1

       The  default  prompt  for  cktime  is: Enter a time of day
       [?,q] The default error message is: ERROR -  Please  enter
       the  time of day. Format is format.  The default help mes-
       sage is: Please enter the time of day. Format  is  format.
       When  the  quit  option  is  chosen  (and  allowed),  q is
       returned along with the return code 3.  The valtime module
       does  not produce any output.  It returns zero for success
       and non-zero for failure.
