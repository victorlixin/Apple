       ckint prompts a user, then  validates  the  response.   It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response should be an integer, text  for  help  and  error
       messages,  and  a  default value (which is returned if the
       user responds with a ).

       All messages are limited in length to  70  characters  and
       are  formatted automatically.  Any white space used in the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels  the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is placed
       at the beginning or  end  of  a  message  definition,  the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If the prompt, help or error message is not  defined,  the
       default  message  (as  defined  under ``Notices'') is dis-
       played.

       Three visual tool modules are linked to the ckint command.
       They  are errint (which formats and displays an error mes-
       sage), helpint (which formats and  displays  a  help  mes-
       sage),  and  valint  (which  validates a response).  These
       modules should be used in conjunction  with  FML  objects.
       In this instance, the FML object defines the prompt.  When
       base is defined in the errint  and  helpint  modules,  the
       messages includes the expected base of the input.

       The  options  and  arguments  for this command are: Do not
       allow quit as a valid response.  Use  width  as  the  line
       length for prompt, help, and error messages.  The base for
       input is base.  Must be 2  to  36,  default  is  10.   The
       default  value  is  default.  The default is not validated
       and so does not have to meet any criteria.  The help  mes-
       sage  is  help.   The  error message is error.  The prompt
       message is prompt.  Send process ID pid a  signal  if  the
       user  chooses  to abort.  When quit is chosen, send signal
       to the process whose pid is specified by  the  -k  option.
       If no signal is specified, use SIGTERM.  Input to be veri-
       fied against base criterion.

       The  default base 10 prompt for ckint is: Enter an integer
       [?,q] The default base 10 error message is: ERROR - Please
       enter  an  integer.   The default base 10 help message is:
       Please enter an integer.  The messages  are  changed  from
       integer  to base base integer if the base is set to a num-
       ber other than 10.

       When the  quit  option  is  chosen  (and  allowed),  q  is
       returned  along with the return code 3.  The valint module
       does not produce any output.  It returns zero for  success
       and non-zero for failure.
