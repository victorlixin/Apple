       chown  changes the owner of the files to owner.  The value
       of owner may be either a decimal user ID or a  login  name
       found in the /etc/passwd file.  Login names in /etc/passwd
       must begin with a  non-numeric  character;  an  alphabetic
       character or any special character except colon is accept-
       able.  chown will optionally also change the group  ID  of
       the  files  to  group.  The value of group may be either a
       decimal group ID or a group name found  in  the  group  ID
       file /etc/group.

       If  chown  is  invoked  by someone other than a privileged
       user, the set-user-ID and set-group ID  bit  of  the  file
       mode, 04000, is cleared.

       Only the owner of a file (or a privileged user) may change
       the owner or group of that file.

       Valid options to chown  are:  Recursive.   chown  descends
       through the directory, and any subdirectories, setting the
       ownership (and group) ID as it  proceeds.   When  symbolic
       links are encountered, they are traversed.  If the file is
       a symbolic link, change the owner (and group) of the  sym-
       bolic link.  Without this option, the owner (and group) of
       the file referenced by the symbolic link is changed.  (See
       ``Notices'' below.)

       The   operating   system   has   a   configuration  option
       {_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED}, to restrict ownership  changes.
       When  this  option  is  in effect the owner of the file is
       prevented from changing the owner ID of the file, and  may
       change the group of the file to a group to which the owner
       belongs.  Only a privileged user  can  arbitrarily  change
       owner  (and group) IDs whether this option is in effect or
       not.  When this option is in  effect,  only  a  privileged
       user can arbitrarily change group IDs.

       does  not  check  the user ID if it is in decimal form; to
       check a user ID in this form, you can use

       Note that, with  appropriate  permissions,  the  owner  of
       setuid files might inadvertantly be changed.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
