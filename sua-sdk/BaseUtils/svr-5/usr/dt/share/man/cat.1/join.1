       join forms, on the standard output,  a  join  of  the  two
       relations  specified  by the lines of file1 and file2.  If
       either file1 or file2 is -, the standard  input  is  used.
       file1 and file2 must be sorted in increasing code set col-
       lating sequence as specified by the LC_COLLATE environment
       variable  on  the  fields  on which they are to be joined,
       normally the first in each line (see join  processes  sup-
       plementary  code  set  characters in files, and recognizes
       supplementary code set characters given to the -e  and  -t
       options  according to the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE
       environment variable (see LANG on

       The output contains one line for each  pair  of  lines  in
       file1  and  file2  that  have identical join fields.  Each
       output line normally consists of the  common  field,  then
       the rest of the line from file1, then the rest of the line
       from file2.

       The default input field separators are blank, tab, or new-
       line.   In  this  case,  multiple  separators count as one
       field separator, and leading separators are ignored.   The
       default output field separator is a blank.

       Some  of the options below use the argument file_no.  This
       argument should be a 1 or a 2 referring to either file1 or
       file2, respectively.

       In  addition to the normal output, produce a line for each
       unpairable line in file file_no, where file_no is 1 or  2.
       If  both -a 1 and -a 2 are specified, all unpairable lines
       shall be output.  Replace empty output fields with  string
       string.  string may contain supplementary code set charac-
       ters.  Equivalent to: -1 field -2 field Equivalent to:  -1
       field  Equivalent  to:  -2 field Each output line includes
       the fields specified in list, each element  of  which  has
       the  form  file_no.field;  0  (zero) in list specifies the
       join field.  The join field is not printed unless specifi-
       cally  requested.   The  elements  of  the list are either
       comma or blank separated, but should form one command-line
       argument.   Fields  selected by list that do not appear in
       the input are treated as empty output  strings  (see  -e).
       Use  character  c  as  a separator (tab character).  Every
       appearance of c in a line is significant.  The character c
       is  used as the field separator for both input and output.
       c may be a supplementary code set character.   Instead  of
       the  default output, write a line only for each unpairable
       line in file_no. If both -v 1 and -v 2 are specified,  all

       unpairable  lines  shall  be  output.  Join on the fieldth
       field of file1.   Fields  are  positive  decimal  integers
       starting  with  1.   Join  on  the fieldth field of file2.
       Fields are positive decimal integers starting with 1.

       The following command line will join the password file and
       the group file, matching on the numeric group ID, and out-
       putting the login name, the  group  name,  and  the  login
       directory.   It is assumed that the files have been sorted
       in code set collating sequence on  the  group  ID  fields.

       With  default  field separation, the collating sequence is
       that of sort -b; with -t, the sequence is that of a  plain
       sort.

       The  conventions  of  the  join, sort, comm, uniq, and awk
       commands are wildly incongruous.

       The -j, -j1, and -j2 options have been  made  obsolete  by
       POSIX.   It  is recommended that application authors avoid
       using these options.
