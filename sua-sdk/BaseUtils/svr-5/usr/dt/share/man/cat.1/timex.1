       timex [options] command

       The given command is executed; the elapsed time, user time
       and system time spent in execution are  reported  in  sec-
       onds.  Optionally, process accounting data for the command
       and all its children can  be  listed  or  summarized,  and
       total system activity during the execution interval can be
       reported.

       The output of timex is written on standard  error.   timex
       returns  an exit status of 1 if it is used incorrectly, if
       it is unable to fork, or if it  could  not  exec  command.
       Otherwise,  timex  returns the exit status of command.  Be
       aware that, because timex returns the exit status of  com-
       mand,  if  command  terminates abnormally, the shell erro-
       neously reports that timex terminated abnormally as  well.

       The  options are: List process accounting records for com-
       mand and all its children.  This option works only if  the
       process    accounting    software    is    installed   and
       /usr/lib/acct/turnacct  has   been   invoked   to   create
       /var/adm/pacct.  Suboption f, h, k, m, r, and t modify the
       data items reported.  The options are  as  follows:  Print
       the  flag  and  system  exit status columns in the output.
       Instead of mean memory size, show the  fraction  of  total
       available CPU time consumed by the process during its exe-
       cution.   This  ``hog  factor''  is  computed  as   (total
       CPU time)/(elapsed time).   Instead  of  memory size, show
       total kcore-minutes.  Show mean core size  (the  default).
       Show  CPU  factor  (user  time/(system-time  + user-time).
       Show separate system and user CPU times.   The  number  of
       blocks read or written and the number of characters trans-
       ferred are always reported.  Report the  total  number  of
       blocks read or written and total characters transferred by
       command and all its children.  This option works  only  if
       the  process  accounting  software  is  installed.  Report
       total system activity (not just that due to command)  that
       occurred  during  the  execution interval of command.  All
       the data items listed in are reported.

       Process records associated with command are selected  from
       the  accounting  file  /var/adm/pacct  by inference, since
       process genealogy is not available.  Background  processes
       having  the  same user ID, terminal ID, and execution time
       window will be spuriously included.

       The  timex  call  expects  that  nightly  accounting  will
       restart  the  /var/adm/pacct  each  day.  If accounting is
       activated, but you do not perform nightly accounting,  you
       should  add  the line 0 0 * * * > var/adm/pacct to the adm

                                                                1

       A simple example: timex -ops sleep 60

       A terminal session of arbitrary complexity can be measured
       by timing a sub-shell: timex -opskmt sh
