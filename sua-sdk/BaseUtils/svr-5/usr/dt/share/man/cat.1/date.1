       If no argument is given, or if the argument begins with +,
       the current date and time  are  printed.   Otherwise,  the
       current date is set for the real-time clock and the system
       clock if the user is a privilege user.

       Supplementary code set characters in + format (see  below)
       are recognized and displayed according to the locale spec-

       The month, day, year, and century may be omitted; the cur-
       rent  values  are supplied as defaults.  For example: date
       10080045 sets the date to Oct 8, 12:45  AM.   The  current
       year is the default because no year is supplied.  The sys-
       tem operates in GMT.  date takes care of the conversion to
       and  from local standard and daylight time.  Only a privi-
       leged user may change the date.  After  successfully  set-
       ting the date and time, date displays the new date accord-
       ing to the default format.  The date command  uses  TZ  to
       determine  the  correct time zone information (see LANG on
       If the argument begins with +, the output of date is under
       the  control  of  the user.  Each Field Descriptor is pre-
       ceded by % and is replaced in the  output  by  its  corre-
       sponding  value.   A single % is encoded by %%.  All other
       characters are copied to the output without  change.   The
       string is always terminated with a new-line character.  If
       the argument contains embedded blanks it  must  be  quoted
       (see  the  ``Example''  section).   Supplementary code set
       characters may be used in format.

       As noted, month and weekday names are recognized according
       to  the  locale specified in the LC_TIME environment vari-
       able (see LANG on The names are taken from  a  file  whose
       format is specified in This file also defines country-spe-
