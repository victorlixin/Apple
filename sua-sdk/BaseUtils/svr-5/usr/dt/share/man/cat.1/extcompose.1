       extcompose  allows  a user on a properly-equipped worksta-
       tion to enter the appropriate data that will enable a mail
       message to be sent with a reference to external data, that
       is, data that is not included in the mail  message  itself
       but  is  otherwise available on the network via a suitable
       mechanism.

       The filename specifies the external  file.   The  user  is
       prompted  for  all  other necessary information.  External
       data may be referenced as local or  AFS  files,  as  files
       available for FTP (anonymous or authenticated), or as data
       available via a mail server mechanism.  The user is  asked
       to  provide a MIME content-type value to describe the type
       of data being referenced, and to specify  whether  or  not
       the  data  has been encoded with one of the algorithms for
       encoding data for email.  (Such  encoding  is  not  recom-
       mended when used with externally referenced data.)

       This program is intended primarily to be called from mail-
       cap files by programs like mailto.
