       pkginfo  displays  information  about software packages or
       sets that are installed on the system (as requested in the
       first  synopsis)  or that reside on a particular device or
       directory (as requested in the second synopsis).  A  pack-
       age  is a collection of related files and executables that
       can be independently installed.  A set is  made  up  of  a
       special-purpose package, referred to as a Set Installation
       Package (SIP), and a collection of one  or  more  packages
       that  are  members  of  the  set.   The  SIP  controls the
       installation of the set.

       When run without options, pkginfo  displays  one  line  of
       information   about   every   installed  package  (whether
       installed completely or partially) whose category  is  not
       the  value  set.   The  information displayed includes the
       primary category, package instance, and name of the  pack-
       age.   For   software  packages  produced before  System V
       Release 4, pkginfo displays  only  the  package  name  and
       abbreviation.   For &everest; software packages (installed
       using pkginfo prints the heading ``Custom Installed  Pack-
       ages'',  followed  by  a list of packages.  The list shows
       the package name and abbreviation.

       The -p and -i options are meaningless if used in  conjunc-
       tion  with the -d option.  The -p and -i options are mutu-
       ally exclusive.  The -x and -l options are mutually exclu-
       sive.

       The options for this command are: Quiet mode.  Do not list
       any package information.  This option  overrides  the  -x,
       -l,  -r, -p, and -i options.  (Can be invoked by a program
       to query whether or not a  package  has  been  installed.)
       Display information only for partially installed packages.
       Display information only  for  fully  installed  packages.
       Extract  and  display  the following information about the
       specified package: abbreviation, name, and, if  available,
       architecture  and version.  If no pkg(s) is/are specified,
       this information is displayed for all installed  packages,
       not  including those "Custom Installed".  Display a ``long
       format'' report (that is, one that includes all  available
       information) about the specified package(s).  If no pkg(s)
       is/are  specified,  information  is  displayed   for   all
       installed    packages,   not   including   those   "Custom
       Installed".  List the installation base for the  specified
       package  if  the  package  is  relocatable.   options  may
       include the following: Display information about  packages
       that belong to category category.  (Categories are defined
       in the category field of the pkginfo file and can  be  one

                                                                1

       of  the  following:  "application",  "graphics", "system",
       "utilities", "set", "patch"; see for details.)  More  than
       one  category  may be specified in a comma-separated list.
       A package is required to belong to only one category, even
       when  multiple  categories are specified.  The package-to-
       category match is not  case-sensitive.   For  example,  to
       list  all installed packages of either category "graphics"
       or "application": pkginfo -c graphics,application  If  the
       category  specified  is set, pkginfo will display informa-
       tion about Set Installation Packages (SIPs).  Specify  the
       architecture  of the package as architecture.  Specify the
       version of the package as version.   All  compatible  ver-
       sions  can be requested by preceding the version name with
       a tilde (~).  The list produced by -v  will  include  pre-
       Release  4  and &everest; software packages (with which no
       version numbers are associated).   Multiple  white  spaces
       are  replaced  with a single space during version compari-
       son.  A short string used to designate an abbreviation for
       the package/set name.  For more information on pkg, see

       To  indicate all instances of a package, specify enclosing
       the command line in single quotes, as  shown,  to  prevent
       the  shell  from  interpreting  the  * character.  Use the
       token all to refer to all packages available on the source
       medium.

       If pkg is a SIP, information about the packages with which
       the SIP is associated will be displayed.  Display informa-
       tion from packages/sets that reside on device.  device can
       be  (a)  the  full  pathname  to  a  directory  (such   as
       /var/tmp),  (b)  the  full  pathname  to a device (such as
       /dev/rmt/* or /dev/dsk/*) [see and (c) a device alias;  or
       (d) "-" which specifies packages in datastream format read
       from standard input.  The default device is the  installa-
       tion spool directory (/var/spool/pkg).

       An  alias  is  the unique name by which a device is known.
       (For example, the alias for a cartridge tape  drive  might
       be  ctape1.)   The  name  must  be limited in length to 64
       characters (DDB_MAXALIAS) and may  contain  only  alphanu-
       meric characters and/or any of the following special char-
       acters: underscore (_), dollar sign ($), hyphen  (-),  and
       period  (.).  No two devices in the database may share the
       same alias.

       pkginfo cannot tell if a pre- System V Release 4 or &ever-
       est; software package is only partially installed.  It  is
       assumed  that  all  pre-Release  4  and &everest; software
       packages are fully installed.

       If pkginfo is invoked to obtain  information  on  packages
       that  are  members  of  sets  located  on  tape media, all
       options to pkginfo are allowed since  the  information  on
       these  packages  is readily available on the tape.  In the
       case of diskettes, if the SIP and each of its member pack-
       ages  are  on separate disks, not all information on these
       packages is available.  In this case, the pkginfo  command
       will  only  display a short listing.  For this reason, the
       -a, -l and -v options will not work for sets  whose  pack-
       ages span over several diskettes.

                                                                3
