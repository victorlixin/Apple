       xscanimage provides a graphical user interface to  control
       an image acquisition device such as a flatbed scanner or a
       camera.  It  allows  previewing  and  scanning  individual
       images  and  can  be invoked either directly from the com-
       mand-line or through the GIMP image manipulation  program.
       In  the former case, xscanimage acts as a stand-alone pro-
       gram that saves acquired images in a suitable  PNM  format
       (PBM for black and white images, PGM for grayscale images,
       and PPM for color images). In the latter case, the  images
       are directly passed to the GIMP for further processing.

       xscanimage  accesses image acquisition devices through the
       SANE (Scanner Access Now  Easy)  interface.  The  list  of
       available  devices  depends on installed hardware and con-
       figuration. When invoked without  an  explicit  devicename
       argument,  xscanimage  presents a dialog listing all known
       and available devices. To access an available device  that
       is  not known to the system, the devicename must be speci-
       fied explicitly.

       To run xscanimage under the GIMP , simply copy it  to  one
       of  the gimp plug-ins directories. If you want to conserve
       disk-space, you can create a symbolic  link  instead.  For
       example: ln -s /usr/local/bin/xscanimage ~/.gimp/plug-ins/
       This adds a symbolic link from the  xscanimage  binary  to
       your  plug-ins  directory.  After  creating  this symbolic
       link, xscanimage will be queried by gimp the next time  it
       is  invoked.   From  then  on,  xscanimage  can be invoked
       through

       contains short-cuts to the SANE devices that  were  avail-
       able at the time the xscanimage was queried.  For example,
       the first PNM pseudo-device is typically available as  the
       short-cut

       gimp caches these short-cuts in ~/.gimp/pluginrc. When the
       list of available devices  changes  (for  example,  a  new
       scanner is installed), you should rebuild the cache. To do
       this, you can either the xscanimage binary,  for  example:
       touch  /usr/local/bin/xscanimage  or  delete  the plug-ins
       cache.

       Shared memory images usually enhance performance but cause

       This  file  holds  the user preferences.  This file should
       not be manipulated directly.   You  should  customize  the
       program   through  the  "Preferences"  dialog.   For  each
       device, there is one rc-file that holds the saved settings
       for  that  particular  device.   This  file  should not be
       manipulated directly. You should use the xscanimage inter-
       face to select appropriate values and then save the device
       settings using  the  menu.   After  acquiring  a  preview,
       xscanimage  normally  saves  the  preview  image  in  this
       device-specific file. The next time the program is started
       up,  the  program can present the old preview image.  This
       feature can be turned off through the dialog.   This  sys-
       tem-wide  file  controls the aspects of the user-interface
       such as colors and fonts. It is a GTK style file and  pro-
       vides  fine  control  over the visual aspects of the user-
       interface.  This file serves the same purpose as the  sys-
       tem-wide  style  file. If present,it takes precedence over
       the system wide style file.
