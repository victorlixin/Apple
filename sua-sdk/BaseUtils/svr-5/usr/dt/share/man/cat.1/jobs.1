       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the shell.  See for  more  informa-
       tion on this shell.

       The  jobs  utility  displays  the status of jobs that were
       started in the current shell environment (see the descrip-
       tion of set -m on the manual page).  When jobs reports the
       termination status of a job, the shell removes its process
       ID  from the list of those known in the current shell exe-
       cution environment.  See  the  ``Commands''  and  ``Jobs''
       subsections  of  the  manual  page for more information on
       asynchronous command execution and job control.

   FFllaaggss
       The following  options  are  supported:  Provide  detailed
       information  about  each  job  listed.   This  information
       includes the job number, current job,  process  group  ID,
       state  and  the command that formed the job.  Display only
       the process IDs for  the  process  group  leaders  of  the
       selected  jobs.  By default, the jobs command displays the
       status of all stopped jobs, running  background  jobs  and
       all  jobs  whose  status  has  changed  and  have not been
       reported by the shell.

   OOppeerraannddss
       The job_id parameter specifies the process ID of  the  job
       whose  status is to be displayed.  If no job_id operand is
       given, the status of all jobs is displayed.

       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of  bg:  Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
       tion variables that are unset or null.  If LANG  is  unset
       or  null, the corresponding value from the implementation-
       specific default locale will  be  used.   If  any  of  the
       internationalization  variables  contains  an invalid set-
       ting, the utility will behave as if none of the  variables
       had  been  defined.   If  set to a non-empty string value,
       override the values of all the other  internationalization
       variables.  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
       sequences of bytes of text data as characters  (for  exam-
       ple,  single- as opposed to multi-byte characters in argu-
       ments).  Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
       affect  the  format  and  contents  of diagnostic messages
       written to standard error.

   OOuuttppuutt
       If the -p option is specified, the output consists of  one
       line for each process ID.

                                                                1

jobs(1)                                                   jobs(1)

       Otherwise,  if  the -l option is not specified, the output
       is a series of lines of  the  form:  [job-number]  current
       state  command  where  the fields are as follows: A number
       that can be used to identify the process group to the  and
       utilities.   The character + identifies the job that would
       be used as a default for the fg or bg commands;  this  job
       can  also  be  specified  using  the job_id %+ or %%.  The
       character - identifies  the  job  that  would  become  the
       default  if the current default job were to exit; this job
       can also be specified using  the  job_id  %-.   For  other
       jobs,  this  field  is a space character.  At most one job
       can be identified with + and at most one job can be  iden-
       tified  with  -.   If there is any suspended job, then the
       current job will be a suspended  job.   If  there  are  at
       least  two suspended jobs, then the previous job will also
       be a suspended job.  One of the following strings (in  the
       POSIX  Locale):  Indicates  that the job has not been sus-
       pended by a signal and has not exited.  Indicates that the
       job  completed  and  returned exit status zero.  Indicates
       that the job completed normally and that  it  exited  with
       the  specified  non-zero exit status, code, expressed as a
       decimal number.  Indicates that the job was  suspended  by
       the  SIGTSTP signal.  Indicates that the job was suspended
       by the SIGSTOP signal.  Indicates that the  job  was  sus-
       pended  by the SIGTTIN signal.  Indicates that the job was
       suspended by the SIGTTOU signal.  Indicates that  the  job
       was  terminated  by  a SIGTERM signal.  Indicates that the
       job was terminated by the indicated signal.   The  associ-
       ated  command  that  was  given  to  the shell.  If the -l
       option is specified, a field containing the process  group
       ID  is  inserted  before the state field.  Also, more pro-
       cesses in a process group may be output on separate lines,
       using only the process ID and command fields.

       An exit code of 0 indicates successful completion; an exit
       code greater than 0 indicates an error.

UUssaaggee
       Use the -p option to find out the process group of a  job.
       Usage  such as (jobs -p) provides a portable way of refer-
       ring to the process group of a job.

       The jobs utility will not work  as  expected  when  it  is
       operating in its own utility execution environment because
       that environment will have no applicable jobs  to  manipu-
       late.  See the ``Usage'' subsection of
