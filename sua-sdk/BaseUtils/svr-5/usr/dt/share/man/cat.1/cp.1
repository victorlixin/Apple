       The cp command copies filen to target.  filen  and  target
       may  not  have  the  same  name.  (Care must be taken when
       using metacharacters.)  If target is not a directory, only
       one file may be specified before it; if it is a directory,
       more than one file may be specified.  If target  does  not
       exist,  cp  creates a file named target.  If target exists
       and is not a directory, its contents are overwritten.   If
       target  is  a  directory,  the  file(s) are copied to that
       directory.

       The following options are recognized:

       cp will prompt for confirmation whenever  the  copy  would
       overwrite  an  existing  target.   An affirmative response
       means  that  the  copy  should  proceed  (the  affirmative
       response  is locale dependent: y in the C locale, see LANG
       on Any other answer prevents cp from  overwriting  target.
       The -i option remains in effect even if the standard input
       is not a terminal.  The ACL and  permission  bits  of  the
       target  will be that of the source.  Otherwise, the exist-
       ing target retains its ACL and permission  bits.   The  -p
       option  causes  the  owner and group to be copied from the
       source file to the target.  cp will attempt  to  overwrite
       an  existing target.  If a file descriptor for target can-
       not be obtained, cp will attempt to unlink target and pro-
       ceed.   See  ``Notices'' below.  (if filen is a directory)
       Copy the directory and all its files, including any subdi-
       rectories  and their files.  (target must be a directory.)
       -r is multithreaded and uses the  enhanced  (walk  a  file
       tree).   See  ``Notices'' below.  Copy a file hierarchy in
       the same fashion as -r.  However, instead of copying  spe-
       cial  files  (device  files,  FIFOs, or symbolic links) by
       copying their contents, create a target file with the same
       file  type  as filen.  Normal files are copied in the same
       fashion as for -r.   -R  is  multithreaded  and  uses  the
       enhanced  nftw (walk a file tree).  See ``Notices'' below.
       Specify  how  to  handle  a  vxfs  file  that  has  extent
       attribute information.  Extent attributes include reserved
       space, a fixed extent size, and extent alignment.  It  may
       not  be possible to preserve the information if the desti-
       nation file system does not support extent attributes, has
       a  different  block  size  than the source file system, or
       lacks free  extents  appropriate  to  satisfy  the  extent
       attribute  requirements.  Valid values for extent_opt are:
       Issue a warning message if  extent  attribute  information
       cannot  be  kept  (default).   Fail  the  copy  if  extent
       attribute  information  cannot  be  kept.   Ignore  extent
       attribute  information  entirely.   If filen is a file and
       target is a link to another file  with  links,  the  other

                                                                1

cp(1)                                                       cp(1)

       links remain and target becomes a new file.

       If target does not exist, cp creates a new file named tar-
       get which has the same ACL and access permissions as filen
       except that the sticky bit is not set unless the user is a
       privileged user; the owner and group of target  are  those
       of the user.

       If target is a file, its contents are overwritten, but the
       ACL, access permissions, owner, and group associated  with
       it are not changed.

       The  last  modification time of target and the last access
       time of filen are set to the time the copy was made.

       If target is a directory, then for each file named, a  new
       file  with  the same ACL and access permissions is created
       in the target directory; the owner and the group are those
       of the user making the copy.  If target has a default ACL,
       it is not inherited by the new files.

       ACLs are supported only if the target file  system  is  of
       type sfs or type vxfs.

       If POSIX2 is set, cp -iR prompts for confirmation only for
       files in the target path, not for directories.

       A -- permits the user to mark the end of any command  line
       options explicitly, thus allowing cp to recognize filename
       arguments that begin with a -.  If  a  --  and  a  -  both
       appear on the same command line, the second will be inter-
       preted as a filename.

       cp without the -R options usually hangs if file is a pipe.

       It  is  not considered an error if more than one of the -f
       or -i options are specified.  The  last  option  specified
       will determine cp's behavior.

       The  algorithm  used  to  efficiently  distribute the tree
       walking among various threads  may  affect  the  order  in
       which  files  and  directories are copied.  This order may
       not match the hierarchy of the original input  tree.   The
       result,  however,  will match the source.  Issuing a BREAK
       to the command while it is executing  will  yield  a  par-
       tially  completed  tree  where  files  and directories may
       appear to have been  copied  arbitrarily.   No  particular
       order  is  guaranteed.   Because they are not dependent on

                                                                2

cp(1)                                                       cp(1)

       any particular order for populating the tree, cp -r and cp
       -R execute much more quickly than previous versions.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
