       tail  copies  the named file to the standard output begin-
       ning at a designated place.  If  no  file  is  named,  the
       standard input is used.

       tail processes supplementary code set characters according
       to the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment  vari-
       able  (see LANG on except that multibyte characters may be
       split, and so not be displayed correctly, when the  -b  or
       -c options are specified.

       If  number  has  no sign, or has a negative sign (-), tail
       will start copying at the absolute value of  number  bytes
       from  the  end  of the file. If number has a + in front of
       it, copying starts at number bytes from the start  of  the
       file.  The origin for the value of number is 1. Therefore,
       -c +1 represents the first byte of the file, and -c -1 the
       last  byte of the file.  This option is the same as the -c
       option, except the unit is lines rather than bytes. There-
       fore, -n will start copying at number lines from the start
       or end of the file, rather than number bytes.  The  origin
       for the value of number is 1.  Therefore, -n +1 represents
       the first line of the file, and -n -1 the last line of the
       file.

       If  neither  -c nor -n is specified, the option -n 10 will
       be assumed.  With the -f (follow) option, if the input  is
       not  a pipe, the program will not terminate after the line
       of the input file has been copied, but will enter an  end-
       less  loop,  wherein  it  sleeps  for  a  second  and then
       attempts to read and copy further records from  the  input
       file.  Thus it may be used to monitor the growth of a file
       that is being written by some other process.  If  +number,
       copying  begins  at  distance number from the beginning of
       the input.  If -number, copying begins at distance  number
       from  the  end of the input.  If number is null, the value
       10 is assumed.  number  is  counted  in  units  of  lines,
       blocks,  or  bytes, according to the appended option l, b,
       or c.  When no units are specified, counting is by  lines.

       If  number  is  not  null, then: +numberc is equivalent to
       -c +number +numberl is equivalent to  -n +number  -numberc
       is  equivalent  to  -c number  or  -c -number  -numberl is
       equivalent to -n number or -n -number

       The f option in this synopsis is identical to  the  normal
       -f option.

                                                                1

       The  r  option  copies  lines  from the specified starting
       point in the file in reverse order.  number is  the  count
       of lines from the end of the file, regardless of the sign.
       The default for r is to print the entire file  in  reverse
       order.

       The r and f options are mutually exclusive.

       The command: tail -f fred will print the last ten lines of
       the file fred, followed by any lines that are appended  to
       fred  between  the  time tail is initiated and killed.  As
       another example, the command: tail  -f  -c  15  fred  will
       print  the last 15 bytes of the file fred, followed by any
       lines that are appended to fred between the time  tail  is
       initiated and killed.

       The  tail  command uses a buffer to seek back from the end
       of a file and this limits the amount of data returned when
       using  commands  such  as:  cat  file  |  tail  -n  1000 >
       /tmp/file tail -n 1000 file

       In addition, the number of lines returned by  tail  varies
       depending  on  the  length  of the lines in the file;  the
       total amount of data returned is  limited  to  the  buffer
       size used (LINE_MAX*10 bytes, or about 20Kbytes).

       The  tail  command  does  not work reliably with character
       special files.

       The second synopsis form (+/-[number][c|l|b][f|r]) may  be
       removed in future releases, and so should be avoided.
