       vplay and vrec provide command  line  audio  playback  and
       recording capabilities, respectively. They both accept the
       same options (although some apply only to  recording)  and
       they run from the same binary.  These programs can be used
       for  recording  and  playing:  Creative  Labs  VOC   files
       Microsoft WAVE files raw audio data

       For a graphical playback and record utility, see

       vplay  and vrec support: the full Creative Labs VOC struc-
       ture, including silence, repeat loops (on seekable input),
       stereo,  ASCII  blocks, and blocks with different sampling
       rate non-stereo cards (SB 1.0 and 2.0); 8-bit stereo files
       will  be  played  as  mono  (the  first  channel  is used)
       non-16-bit cards; 16-bit WAVE files will be  played  as  8
       bit (you can play a 16-bit stereo WAVE file, on an SB 1.0)
       vplay and vrec do not support:  packed  VOC  files  multi-
       block  WAVE  files WAVE files not coded to PCM (Pulse Code
       Modulation) multi-channel WAVE files

       If no filenames are given, vplay uses stdin and vrec  uses
       stdout.   quiet  mode,  console messages are not displayed
       sets the sampling rate in Hz; the default is 8000.   If  a
       rate  less  than  300 is entered, it will be multiplied by
       1000.  record a  Creative  Labs  VOC  file;  this  is  the
       default.   record  a  Microsoft  WAVE file record raw data
       without header stereo; the  default  is  mono.   sets  the
       playback  or  recording time in seconds; the default is no
       time limit.  sets sample size (bits per sample). Available
       values are 8, 12, and 16; the default is 8.

       The  options  for  speed,  time,  and sample size are only
       valid for raw data files. VOC and WAVE files include  this
       information in their headers/internal structure.

       The  -t  parameter applies to each file. For example: vrec
       -r -t 1 a b c records one second of audio data to each  of
       the  files  a,  b,  and c vplay -t 1 a b c plays the first
       second of each of the files a, b and c (if  they  are  raw
       audio).

       Before playing or recording sound samples, you must: phys-
       ically install the audio adapter, speaker system, and  any
       input  devices, following the instructions in the hardware
       documentation configure the audio adapter according to the

                                                                1

       To play existing sound files, enter vplay file_name,  with
       any  desired  options.  The -s, -v, -w, -r, and -b options
       have no effect on playback; the -S option has no effect if
       your  hardware  does  not  support stereo of the sample is
       mono.

       To record sound samples: Ensure that an input device (such
       as  a  microphone or CD-player) is connected to your audio
       adapter's input jack.  Enter vrec file_name with appropri-
       ate  options.   Start  the sound input (for example, start
       talking or play the CD).  Stop the sound input and record-
       ing utility when complete.  A recording overrun can result
       if the sound source generates data faster  than  the  com-
       puter  can process it.  This generally happens when the -s
       (sample rate) and/or -b (sample size) options are set  too
       high.   If this happens, you might experience audio driver
       buffer  overflows  and  missing  audio  sections  in   the
       recorded  file.   These  error  conditions are not usually
       detected by the audio driver, although you might see  con-
       sole  error  messages.  Consult your sound card documenta-
       tion for more information about your hardware's limits.
