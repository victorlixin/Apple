       ckstr  prompts  a  user  and  validates  the response.  It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response  should be a string, text for help and error mes-
       sages, and a default value (which is returned if the  user
       responds with a ).

       The  answer  returned  from  this  command  must match the
       defined regular expression  and  be  no  longer  than  the
       length  specified.   If  no  regular  expression is given,
       valid input must be a string with a length  less  than  or
       equal  to the length defined with no internal white space.
       Leading and/or trailing white spaces are ignored.   If  no
       length  is  defined,  the length is not checked.  Either a
       regular expression or a length must be given with the com-
       mand.

       All  messages  are  limited in length to 70 characters and
       are formatted automatically.  Any white space used in  the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is  placed
       at  the  beginning  or  end  of  a message definition, the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If  the  prompt, help or error message is not defined, the
       default message (as defined  under  ``Notices'')  is  dis-
       played.

       Three visual tool modules are linked to the ckstr command.
       They are errstr (which formats and displays an error  mes-
       sage),  helpstr  (which  formats  and displays a help mes-
       sage), and valstr (which  validates  a  response).   These
       modules  should  be used in conjunction with FMLI objects.
       In this instance, the FMLI object defines the prompt.

       The options and arguments for this  command  are:  Do  not
       allow  quit  as  a  valid response.  Use width as the line
       length for prompt, help, and error messages.  Validate the
       input  against  regular  expression  regexp.   May include
       white space.  If multiple  expressions  are  defined,  the
       answer need match only one of them.  The maximum length of
       the input is length.  The default value is  default.   The

                                                                1

       default  is not validated and so does not have to meet any
       criteria.  The help message is help.  The error message is
       error.  The prompt message is prompt.  Send process ID pid
       a signal if the user chooses to abort.  When quit is  cho-
       sen,  send signal to the process whose pid is specified by
       the -k option.  If no signal is  specified,  use  SIGTERM.

       The  default  prompt  for  ckstr  is: Enter an appropriate
       value [?,q] The default error message  is  dependent  upon
       the  type of validation involved.  The user is told either
       that the length or the pattern matching failed.

       The default help message is also dependent upon  the  type
       of  validation involved.  If a regular expression has been
       defined, the message  is:  Please  enter  a  string  which
       matches  the  following  pattern:  regexp  Other  messages
       define the length requirement  and  the  definition  of  a
       string.

       When  the  quit  option  is  chosen  (and  allowed),  q is
       returned along with the return code 3.  The valstr  module
       does  not produce any output.  It returns zero for success
       and non-zero for failure.

       Unless a q for ``quit'' is disabled by the  -Q  option,  a
       single  q  to  the  following:  ckstr  -rq is treated as a
       ``quit'' and not as a pattern match.
