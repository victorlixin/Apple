       bdiff  is used in a manner analogous to diff to find which
       lines in file1 and file2 must  be  changed  to  bring  the
       files  into agreement.  Its purpose is to allow processing
       of files too large for diff.  If file1 (file2) is  -,  the
       standard input is read.

       Valid  options  to bdiff are: The number of line segments.
       The value of n is 3500 by default.  If the optional  third
       argument  is  given  and  it is numeric, it is used as the
       value for n.  This is  useful  in  those  cases  in  which
       3500-line  segments  are too large for diff, causing it to
       fail.  Specifies that no diagnostics are to be printed  by
       bdiff  (silent option).  Note, however, that this does not
       suppress possible diagnostic  messages  from  diff,  which
       bdiff calls.

       bdiff ignores lines common to the beginning of both files,
       splits the remainder of each file  into  n-line  segments,
       and  invokes  diff  on  corresponding  segments.   If both
       optional arguments are specified, they must appear in  the
       order indicated above.

       The  output  of  bdiff  is exactly that of diff, with line
       numbers adjusted to account  for  the  segmenting  of  the
       files  (that  is, to make it look as if the files had been
       processed whole).  Note that because of the segmenting  of
       the files, bdiff does not necessarily find a smallest suf-
       ficient set of file differences.
