       mv [-f] [-i] [-e extent_opt] file . . . target

       The  mv  command  moves  the specified files to target.  A
       file and the target must not have the  same  name.   (Care
       must  be  taken  when using metacharacters).  If target is
       not a directory, only one file may be specified before it;
       if it is a directory, more than one file may be specified.
       If target does not exist, mv creates a file named  target.
       If  target exists and is not a directory, its contents are
       overwritten.  If target is a  directory  the  file(s)  are
       moved to that directory.

       If  mv determines that the mode of target forbids writing,
       it will print the mode (see ask for a response,  and  read
       the  standard input for one line.  If the line begins with
       y, the mv occurs, if permissible; otherwise,  the  command
       exits.  (The form of an affirmative is locale dependent, y
       in the C locale. See LANG on When mv succeeds, the result-
       ing  file(s)  will have the same uid and gid as the source
       file(s).  When the parent directory of a file is  writable
       and  has  the sticky bit set, one or more of the following
       conditions must be true: the user must own  the  file  the
       user  must  own the directory the file must be writable by
       the user the user must be a privileged user The  following
       options  are  recognized:  mv will prompt for confirmation
       whenever the move would overwrite an existing target.  A y
       answer  means  that  the  move  should proceed.  Any other
       answer prevents mv from overwriting the target.   mv  will
       move  the  file(s) without prompting even if it is writing
       over an existing target.  This  option  overrides  the  -i
       option.   Note  that  this  is the default if the standard
       input is not a terminal.  Specify how  to  handle  a  vxfs
       file   that  has  extent  attribute  information.   Extent
       attributes include reserved space, a  fixed  extent  size,
       and  extent alignment.  It may not be possible to preserve
       the information if the destination file  system  does  not
       support extent attributes, has a different block size than
       the source file system, or lacks free extents  appropriate
       to  satisfy the extent attribute requirements.  Valid val-
       ues for extent_opt are: Issue a warning message if  extent
       attribute  information cannot be kept (default).  Fail the
       move if  extent  attribute  information  cannot  be  kept.
       Ignore  extent attribute information entirely.  If file is
       a directory, target must be a directory in the same physi-
       cal file system.  target and file do not have to share the
       same parent directory.

       If file is a file and target is a  link  to  another  file
       with  links,  the  other links remain and target becomes a
       new file.

                                                                1

       If file and target  are  on  different  file  systems,  mv
       copies  the  file  and  deletes the original; any links to
       other files are lost.

       A -- permits the user to mark explicitly the  end  of  any
       command  line  options,  allowing mv to recognize filename
       arguments that begin with a -.  As an aid  to  BSD  migra-
       tion,  mv  accepts  - as a synonym for --.  This migration
       aid may disappear in a future release.  If a --  and  a  -
       both  appear  on the same command line, the second will be
       interpreted as a filename.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
