       The dslpsearch utility allows users and administrators  to
       search  the  directory for print system objects. For exam-
       ple, a user could search for any printer  that  can  print
       color  PostScript files. The main use of this utility will
       be to search for  print  queues  that  match  the  search-
       string. The utility returns the Distinguished Name (DN) of
       any objects that match the search string.

       The  following  command  line  options  are  supported  by
       dslpsearch:  If  a directory-context is given, the command
       searches for objects in that directory context. Otherwise,
       it  only  searches  in  the current directory context. For
       example "ou=mydept,o=sco".  Search for print  queues  that
       match the search options. The search is done on the physi-
       cal printer objects but  the  print  queues  that  service
       those  printers  are displayed. This is the default search
       type. The -q option cannot be specified with  -P.   Search
       for physical printers that match the search string. The -P
       option cannot be specified with -q.  This option  is  used
       with the -q option, and causes a list of physical printers
       servicing the print queue also to be displayed: dslpsearch
       -q  -p  Multiple search options may form a comma-separated
       list. Each option may be constructed from  the  following:
       one  or  more  of the following Page Description Languages
       (PDLs): PCL, PS, ESCP, SIMPLE, TEXT any of  the  following
       printer facilities: COLOR or COLOUR, DUPLEX, TRAYS, FINISH
       one or  more  physical  printer  locations,  specified  by
       LOC=xxxxxxxx or LOC='aaaa bbbbb'

       The string value defined by LOC= is searched on with wild-
       cards placed at both ends  of  the  string,  so  LOC=Room1
       would find any printer with Room1 in its location, such as
       Building X, Room1, Bay6. The string value  can  also  have
       wildcards  (*)  embedded  in it, for example LOC="Building
       X*Bay6".  Multiple LOC values are OR'd in the search.

       The following are valid command  lines  containing  search
       strings:   dslpsearch   -q   -o   PCL,ESCP,LOC=room2,COLOR
       dslpsearch -q -p -o "PS, LOC='Building 1, Room1', DUPLEX"
