       makekey  improves  the  usefulness  of  encryption schemes
       depending on a  key  by  increasing  the  amount  of  time
       required  to  search  the  key space.  It attempts to read
       eight bytes for its key (the  first  eight  input  bytes),
       then  it attempts to read two bytes for its salt (the last
       two input bytes).  The output depends on the  input  in  a
       way  intended  to  be  difficult  to  compute (that is, to
       require a substantial fraction of a second).

       The first eight input bytes (the input key) can  be  arbi-
       trary  ASCII characters.  The last two (the salt) are best
       chosen from the set of digits, ., /, and upper and  lower-
       case  letters.   The  salt  characters are repeated as the
       first two characters of the output.  The remaining 11 out-
       put  characters  are  chosen from the same set as the salt
       and constitute the output key.

       The transformation performed is essentially the following:
       the  salt  is  used  to  select one of 4,096 cryptographic
       machines all based on the National Bureau of Standards DES
       algorithm,  but broken in 4,096 different ways.  Using the
       input key as key,  a  constant  string  is  fed  into  the
       machine  and  recirculated a number of times.  The 64 bits
       that come out are distributed into the 66 output key  bits
       in the result.

       makekey  is intended for programs that perform encryption.
       Usually, its input and output will be pipes.

       makekey  can  produce  different  results  depending  upon
       whether  the  input is typed at the terminal or redirected
       from a file.

       This command is provided with  the  Encryption  Utilities,
       which is only available in the United States.
