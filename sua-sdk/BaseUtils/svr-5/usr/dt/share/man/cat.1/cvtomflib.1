       cvtomflib  converts  libraries of OMF objects to libraries
       of ELF objects.  It is intended for use  with  application
       packages  that  provide  only OMF libraries that could not
       otherwise be used in an ELF-based environment.

       The options have the following meanings.   Verbose  output
       is  produced  for  each  converted  object.   Without this
       option, cvtomflib does its  work  silently.   This  option
       allows  the  user  to specify a new name, outfile, for the
       converted library without  changing  the  original.   This
       option  is  only  available when a single library is being
       converted.

       The original  order  of  objects  within  the  library  is
       retained.

       Each  library  is converted in the directory in which it's
       located.  Without the -o  option,  the  converted  library
       will  overwrite  the  original; therefore, you may want to
       copy the original library before conversion.
