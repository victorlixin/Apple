       The size command produces segment or section size informa-
       tion in bytes for each  loaded  section  in  ELF  or  COFF
       object files.  size prints out the size of the text, data,
       and bss (uninitialized data) segments  (or  sections)  and
       their total.

       size  processes  ELF  and COFF object files entered on the
       command line.  If an archive file is  input  to  the  size
       command,  the  information  for  each  object  file in the
       archive is displayed.

       When calculating segment  information,  the  size  command
       prints  out  the  total file size of the non-writable seg-
       ments, the total file size of the writable  segments,  and
       the  total  memory size of the writable segments minus the
       total file size of the writable segments.

       If it cannot calculate segment  information,  size  calcu-
       lates   section  information.   When  calculating  section
       information, it prints out the total size of sections that
       are  allocatable,  non-writable, and not NOBITS, the total
       size of the sections that are allocatable,  writable,  and
       not NOBITS, and the total size of the writable sections of
       type NOBITS.  (NOBITS sections do  not  actually  take  up
       space in the file.)

       If  size cannot calculate either segment or section infor-
       mation, it prints an error message  and  stops  processing
       the file.

       Prints  out the size of each loadable segment, the permis-
       sion flags of the segment, then the total of the  loadable
       segment  sizes.   If there is no segment data, size prints
       an error message and stops processing the file.

       Prints out the size of each allocatable section, the  name
       of  the  section,  and the total of the section sizes.  If
       there is no section data, size prints out an error message
       and stops processing the file.

       Prints out non-loadable segment or non-allocatable section
       sizes.  If segment data exists, size prints out the memory
       size  of  each  loadable segment or file size of each non-
       loadable segment, the permission flags, and the total size
       of the segments.  If there is no segment data, size prints
       out, for each allocatable and non-allocatable section, the
       memory  size,  the section name, and the total size of the
       sections.  If there is no segment or  section  data,  size
       prints an error message and stops processing.

                                                                1

       Prints numbers in octal, not decimal.

       Prints the version information for the size command on the
       standard error output.

       Prints numbers in hexadecimal; not decimal.

       The examples below are typical  size  output.   size  file
       2724 + 88 + 0 =  2812

       size  -f file           26(.text) + 5(.init) + 5(.fini)  =
       36

       size -F file           2724(r-x) + 88(rwx) + 0(rwx) = 2812

       Since  the  size  of bss sections is not known until link-
       edit time, the size command does not give the  true  total
       size of pre-linked objects.
