       The  vtwait command is used to allow typing on the console
       after a system startup, without it switching to X. If  the
       seconds  parameter is specified, the VTWAITTIME tunable is
       set to that value. Any keystroke within that  time  before
       the  X  server  is  started  will prevent the console from
       switching to the X session.

       Invoked without options, vtwait returns a message like the
       following:  VTWAITTIME = 60 seconds That is, any keystroke
       within one minute of the X session starting  will  prevent
       the X session from taking control of the console.

       Setting  VTWAITTIME to zero disables the feature. The per-
       missible range, in seconds, is 1-600 (10 minutes).
