       The  dsdm manages a database of all drop sites on the dis-
       play.  When a drag  operation  is  started,  the  dsdm  is
       queried  for  a  list  of  the  drop sites.  The drop site
       information is used by the dragging application  to  iden-
       tify  drop sites and provide user feedback during the drag
       operation.

       The dsdm provides a drag-and-drop  gateway  between  Motif
       and OPENLOOK applications.  When an object is dropped on a
       drop site, the dsdm gets a  drop  message  from  the  drop
       sender  application.   The  dsdm  then translates the drop
       message, and sends the  translated  message  to  the  drop
       receiver application.

       The  dsdm  must be running before applications are started
       for the drag-and-drop gateway feature to work.
