       news  is used to keep the user informed of current events.
       By convention, these events are described by files in  the
       directory /var/news.

       When  invoked  without arguments, news prints the contents
       of all current files in /var/news, most recent first, with
       each  preceded  by an appropriate header.  news stores the
       currency time as the modification date  of  a  file  named
       .news_time  in  the user's home directory (the identity of
       this directory is determined by the  environment  variable
       $HOME); only files more recent than this currency time are
       considered current.   option  causes  news  to  print  all
       items,  regardless  of currency.  In this case, the stored
       time is not changed.  option causes  news  to  report  the
       names  of  the  current  items without printing their con-
       tents, and  without  changing  the  stored  time.   option
       causes  news to report how many current items exist, with-
       out printing their names or contents, and without changing
       the  stored time.  It is useful to include such an invoca-
       tion of news in one's .profile file, or  in  the  system's
       /etc/profile.   All other arguments are assumed to be spe-
       cific news items that are to be printed.

       If a delete is typed during the printing of a  news  item,
       printing  stops  and  the  next  item is started.  Another
       delete within one second of the first causes  the  program
       to terminate.
