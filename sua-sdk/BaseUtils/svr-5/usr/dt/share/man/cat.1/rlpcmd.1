       rlpcmd  sets the real user ID to lp and then runs with the
       arguments rsh_args.

       Typically,  the  network  printer  interface  script  uses
       rlpcmd for remote printing using .  In this case, rsh_args
       specify the remote  machine  node,  the  command  and  its
       option arguments (see ``Examples'').

       You  must  establish user equivalence for lp on the remote
       machine with lp on the local machine.  One way to do  this
       is to create a .rhosts file in the home directory of lp on
       the remote machine (see lp or root must  own  the  .rhosts
       file,  and  this  must  not be writable by other groups or
       users.

       rlpcmd returns the exit value of if it  executes  success-
       fully;  it returns 1 if it cannot determine the user ID of
       user lp; it returns an error code if the real user ID can-
       not  be  set to the current user, or if rsh cannot be exe-
       cuted.

       rlpcmd requires the inet package to have been installed.

       rlpcmd should work from &gemini;  systems  to  any  system
       which  understands the  rsh protocol. However, this is not
       guaranteed.

       Local printer p_here  prints  on  remote  printer  p_there
       attached  to  host  machine  m_there.   The printer p_here
       should be configured using network, the  interface  script
       for  p_here on the local machine m_here, reads the follow-

       options that you would specify to lp depend on the config-
       uration of the remote printer.

       The entry in the  /usr/spool/lp/.rhosts  file  on  m_there
       would be: m_here    lp
