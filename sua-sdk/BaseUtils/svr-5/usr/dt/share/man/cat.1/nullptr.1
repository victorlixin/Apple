       The  nullptr  command  supports  three different behaviors
       when applications dereference through a NULL pointer.   To
       support  existing  applications  the  default  behavior as
       delivered is to enable null-pointer dereferences.

       When null-pointer dereferences are enabled, any user  pro-
       gram  attempt  to read memory in the first page (addresses
       0-4095) will successfully  return  zero.   When  disabled,
       these memory reads behave like any other bad memory refer-
       ence and cause a SIGSEGV signal to be sent to  the  refer-
       encing  lightweight  process.   Memory  writes  to  page 0
       always generate SIGSEGV.

       The default  behavior  can  be  changed  by  changing  the
       NULLPTR tunable parameter.

       The  nullptr  command  can be used to override the default
       behavior for a particular user, based on the  user  ID  of
       the invoking process.

       The nullptr command can be called with the following argu-
       ments: With this argument,  nullptr  enables  null-pointer
       references  for  the  current  user.   With this argument,
       nullptr disables null-pointer references for  the  current
       user.

       With no arguments, nullptr displays the behavior in effect
       for the current user.
