       mkdir  creates the specified directories in mode 777 (pos-
       sibly altered by

       Standard entries in a  directory,  .   for  the  directory
       itself,  and  ..   for  its parent are made automatically.
       mkdir cannot create these entries by name.  Creation of  a
       directory  requires  write permission in the parent direc-
       tory.

       If the parent directory is a  Multilevel  Directory  (MLD)
       and  the  process  is  in real mode, the directory created
       will be an effective directory.  Note that unlike  regular
       directories,  effective  directories  do  not  inherit the
       default Access Control Lists (ACLs) of the  parent.   MLDs
       are  supported only if the Enhanced Security Utilities are
       installed; ACLs also require a file system of type sfs  or
       of type vxfs..

       The  owner  ID and group ID of the new directories are set
       to the process's real user ID and group ID,  respectively.

       The  mkdir command has the following options: Use mode for
       the new directories.  Choices for mode  can  be  found  in
       Create  all  the  non-existing  parent  directories first.
       dirname is a MLD; valid  only  if  the  Enhanced  Security
       Utilities  are  installed.   The  caller  must possess the
       P_MULTIDIR privilege for this option.  Apply level to  the
       named directory; valid only if the Enhanced Security Util-
       ities are installed.  It must  be  either  a  valid  level
       alias  name or be in the following format: h_name [:c_name
       [,c_name]]...]  where h_name and c_name are  described  in
       This  level  information  is  verified  against  the Level
       Translation Data Base (LTDB) and then placed on the  named
       directory.

       In  addition,  level must dominate the level of its parent
       directory.

       mkdir  returns exit code 0 if all directories given in the
       command line were made successfully.  Otherwise, it prints
       a diagnostic and returns non-zero.

       2GB.
