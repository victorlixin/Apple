       setcolor and setcolour allow the user to set the screen to
       a specific color.  Both foreground and  background  colors
       can  be  set  independently in a range of 16 colors.  set-
       color can also set the reverse video and graphics  charac-
       ter  colors.   setcolor with no arguments produces a usage
       message that displays all available  colors,  then  resets
       the screen to its previous state.

       For example, the following strings are possible colors:
       blue      magenta      brown      black
       lt_blue   lt_magenta   yellow     gray
       cyan      white        green      red
       lt_cyan   hi_white     lt_green   lt_red

       The  following options are available for setcolor and set-
       colour.  In the arguments below, color is taken  from  the
       above list.  Sets the screen to normal white characters on
       black background.  Sets the foreground to the first color.
       Sets  background  to second color if a second color choice
       is specified.  Sets the background to the specified color.
       Set  the  foreground reverse video characters to the first
       color.  Set reverse video characters' background to second
       color.   Set  the  foreground  graphics  characters to the
       first color.  Set graphics characters' background to  sec-
       ond color.  Sets the color of the screen border (over scan
       region).  To reset border color, use -o  black.   Set  the
       pitch  and  duration  of the bell.  Pitch is the period in
       microseconds, and duration is measured in fifths of a sec-
       ond.   When  using this option, a -G (bell) must be echoed
       to the screen for the command to work.  For example:  set-
       color  -p 2500 2 echo ^G Set the first and last scan lines
       of the cursor.

       The ability of setcolor to  set  any  of  these  described
       functions  is  ultimately  dependent  on  the  ability  of
       devices to support them.  For example, the -o option  does
       not work on the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA).

       setcolor emits an escape sequence that may or may not have
       an effect on monochrome devices.

       Occasionally changing the screen color  can  help  prolong
       the life of your monitor.
