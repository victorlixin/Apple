       rlpstat  prints  information  about  the status of a print
       service on a remote host connected via .

       rlpstat allows the user to look at the queue of  a  remote
       printer.  The  command  is  invoked  with  the name of the
       printer as it is known locally (that is, by its host  com-
       puter).  For  example,  rlpstat local_printer_name rlpstat
       will find the machine on which the printer  is  physically
       connected  and  do an lpstat -o local_printer_name to show
       the queue on that machine for that printer.

       rlpstat makes the following assumptions: lp accounts exist
       on  both local and host machines. To establish equivalence
       of the lp accounts, the host machine must contain the name
       of  the  local  machine  and  lp. The .rhosts file must be
       owned by root or lp, and must not  be  writable  by  other
       groups    or    users.     The    documented   format   of
       /usr/spool/lp/remote is adhered to.  The first  option  of
       the lp command to be executed on the remote machine is the
       destination (-d local_printer_name).
