       dpost  translates  files  created  by  into PostScript and
       writes the results on the standard output.   If  no  files
       are  specified,  or  if  -  is one of the input files, the
       standard input is read.  The following options are  under-
       stood: Print num copies of each page.  By default only one
       copy is printed.  Sets the text  encoding  level  to  num.
       The  recognized  choices are 0, 1, and 2.  The size of the
       output  file  and  print  time  should  decrease  as   num
       increases.   Level  2  encoding will typically be about 20
       percent faster than level 0, which is the default and pro-
       duces output essentially identical to previous versions of
       dpost.  Magnify each  logical  page  by  the  factor  num.
       Pages  are  scaled  uniformly  about  the origin, which is
       located near the upper left  corner  of  each  page.   The
       default  magnification is 1.0.  Print num logical pages on
       each piece of paper, where num can be any  positive  inte-
       ger.   By default, num is set to 1.  Print those pages for
       which numbers are given in the comma-separated list.   The
       list  contains single numbers N and ranges N1-N2.  A miss-
       ing N1 means the lowest numbered page, a missing N2  means
       the  highest.  Print files in either portrait or landscape
       mode.  Only the first character of  mode  is  significant.
       The  default mode is portrait.  Set the line width used to
       implement troff graphics commands to num points,  where  a
       point  is  approximately 1/72 of an inch.  By default, num
       is set to 0.3 points.  Translate  the  origin  num  inches
       along  the positive x axis.  The default coordinate system
       has the origin fixed near the upper  left  corner  of  the
       page, with positive x to the right and positive y down the
       page.  Positive num moves everything right.   The  default
       offset is 0 inches.  Translate the origin num inches along
       the positive y axis.  Positive num moves text up the page.
       The  default  offset is 0.  Use dir as the font directory.
       The default dir is /usr/lib/font, and dpost  reads  binary
       font  files from directory /usr/lib/font/devpost.  Use dir
       as the host resident font directory.  Files in this direc-
       tory  should be complete PostScript font descriptions, and
       must be assigned a name that corresponds to the  appropri-
       ate  two-character  troff  font  name.   Each font file is
       copied to the output
       file only when needed and at most once  during  each  job.
       There is no default directory.  Use file as the PostScript
       prologue        which,        by        default,        is
       /usr/lib/postscript/dpost.ps.  Disables PostScript picture
       inclusion.  A recommended option when dpost is  run  by  a
       spooler  in  a  networked environment.  Use font files for
       device  name  as  the  best   description   of   available
       PostScript  fonts.   By  default,  name is set to post and
       dpost reads binary files from /usr/lib/font/devpost.

                                                                1

       The files should be prepared by troff.  The  default  font
       files  in  /usr/lib/font/devpost produce the best and most
       efficient output.  They assume a resolution  of  720  dpi,
       and  can  be  used  to  format  files by adding the -Tpost
       option to the troff call.  Older versions of the  eqn  and
       pic  preprocessors  need to know the resolution that troff
       will be using to format the files.  If those are the  ver-
       sions  installed on your system, use the -r720 option with
       eqn and -T720 with pic.

       dpost makes no assumptions about resolutions.  The first x
       res  command  sets  the  resolution  used to translate the
       input files, the DESC.out file, usually /usr/lib/font/dev-
       post/DESC.out,  defines  the resolution used in the binary
       font files, and the PostScript prologue is responsible for
       setting up an appropriate user coordinate system.

       An  exit status of 0 is returned if files have been trans-
       lated successfully, while 2 often indicates a syntax error
       in the input files.

       Output  files  often do not conform to Adobe's file struc-
       turing conventions.  Piping the output  of  dpost  through
       postreverse   should   produce   a   minimally  conforming
       PostScript file.

       Although dpost can handle files formatted for any  device,
       emulation  is  expensive  and  can easily double the print
       time and the size of the output file.  No attempt has been
       made to implement the character sets or fonts available on
       all devices supported by troff.  Missing  characters  will
       be  replaced  by  white space, and unrecognized fonts will
       usually default to one of the Times fonts (that is, R,  I,
       B, or BI).

       An  x  res  command must precede the first x init command,
       and all the input files should have been prepared for  the
       same output device.

       Use  of the -T option is not encouraged.  Its only purpose

                                                                2

       is to enable the use of other PostScript font  and  device
       description files, that perhaps use different resolutions,
       character sets, or fonts.

       Although level 0 encoding is the only scheme that has been
       thoroughly tested, level 2 is fast and may be worth a try.

       If the old versions of eqn and pic are installed  on  your
       system, you can obtain the best possible looking output by
       issuing a command line such as the  following:  pic  -T720
       file  |  tbl | eqn -r720 | troff -mm -Tpost | dpost Other-
       wise, pic file | tbl | eqn |  troff  -mm  -Tpost  |  dpost
       should give the best results.
