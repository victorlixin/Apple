       file  performs  a series of tests on each file supplied by
       arg and, optionally, on each file supplied in ffile in  an
       attempt to classify it.  If arg appears to be a text file,
       file examines the first 512 bytes and tries to  guess  its
       programming language.  If arg is an executable a.out, file
       prints the version stamp, provided it is greater  than  0.
       If arg is a symbolic link, by default the link is followed
       and file tests the file that the symbolic link references.
       Check  the  magic  file for format errors.  For reasons of
       efficiency, this validation is normally not  carried  out.
       ffile  contains the names of the files to be examined.  Do
       not follow symbolic links.   Use  mfile  as  an  alternate
       magic file, instead of /etc/magic.

       file  uses  /etc/magic to identify files that have a magic
       number.  A magic number is a numeric  or  string  constant
       that indicates the file type.  Commentary at the beginning
       of /etc/magic explains its format.

       file classifies files containing  supplementary  code  set
       characters  according  to  the  locale  specified  in  the
       LC_CTYPE environment variable (see LANG on file reads each
       argument  and  can  distinguish  data  files, program text
       files, shell scripts, and executable files as follows:
