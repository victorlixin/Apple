       The  alpq  command takes no arguments or options.  It pre-
       sents, on its standard output, a  list  of  the  functions
       currently  registered  with  the  alp STREAMS module.  For
       information on building and using these functions, see

       The output list contains entries  like  the  following:  1
       Ucase    (Upper to lower case converter)

       The first field is a sequence number.  The second field is
       the function's name (by which it may be accessed), and the
       third field is the function's explanation string.

       The  alpq command works by pushing the alp STREAMS module,
       querying it via and then popping it immediately; its stan-
       dard  input  (normally the user's tty) must therefore be a
       stream.
