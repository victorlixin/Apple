       cat reads each file in sequence and writes it on the stan-
       dard output.  Thus cat file prints the contents of file on
       your  terminal,  and  cat  file1 file2 >file3 concatenates
       file1 and file2, and writes the results in file3.   If  no
       input  file is given, or if the argument - is encountered,
       cat reads from the standard input.  cat processes  supple-
       mentary code set characters according to the locale speci-
       fied in the LC_CTYPE environment variable (see LANG on

       The following options apply to  cat:  The  output  is  not
       buffered.   (The  default  is  buffered  output.)   cat is
       silent  about  non-existent  files.   Causes  non-printing
       characters  (with  the  exception  of tabs, new-lines, and
       form-feeds) to be printed visibly.  ASCII control  charac-
       ters  (octal  000 - 037) are printed as ^n, where n is the
       corresponding ASCII character in the range octal 100 - 137
       (@,  A,  B, C, . . ., X, Y, Z, [, \, ], ^, and _); the DEL
       character (octal 0177) is printed ^?.  Other non-printable
       characters  are printed as M-x, where x is the ASCII char-
       acter specified by the low-order seven bits.  All  supple-
       mentary  code  set  characters are considered to be print-
       able.

       The following options may be  used  with  the  -v  option:
       Causes  tabs  to  be  printed  as  ^I  and formfeeds to be
       printed as ^L.  Causes a $ character to be printed at  the
       end of each line (prior to the new-line).

       The  -t and -e options are ignored if the -v option is not
       specified.
