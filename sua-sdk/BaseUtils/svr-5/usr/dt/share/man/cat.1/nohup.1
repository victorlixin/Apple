       nohup executes command with hangups and quits ignored.  If
       output is not re-directed by the user, both standard  out-
       put   and  standard  error  are  sent  to  nohup.out.   If
       nohup.out is not writable in the current directory, output
       is redirected to $HOME/nohup.out.

       It  is frequently desirable to apply nohup to pipelines or
       lists of commands.  This  can  be  done  only  by  placing
       pipelines  and  command  lists  in a single file, called a
       shell procedure.  One can then issue: nohup  sh  file  and
       the  nohup  applies  to  everything in file.  If the shell
       procedure file is to be executed often, then the  need  to
       type  sh  can be eliminated by giving file execute permis-
       sion.  Add an ampersand and the contents of file  are  run
       in  the background with interrupts also ignored (see nohup
       file & An example of what the contents of  file  could  be
       is: sort ofile > nfile

       In  the case of the following command nohup command1; com-
       mand2 nohup applies only to command1.  The  command  nohup
       (command1; command2) is syntactically incorrect.
