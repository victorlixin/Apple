       kill sends a signal to the specified processes.  The value
       of signal may be numeric or  symbolic  (see  The  symbolic
       signal    name    is   the   name   as   it   appears   in
       /usr/include/sys/signal.h, with the  SIG  prefix  stripped
       off.   Signal  15  (SIGTERM) is sent by default; this will
       normally kill processes that do not catch  or  ignore  the
       signal.

       pid is either an unsigned or negative integer that identi-
       fies which process(es) should receive the signal.  If  pid
       is  unsigned, the process with process ID pid is selected.
       If pid is preceded by a negative sign (-),  all  processes
       with process group ID pid are selected.

       For  example,  if  pid  is 0, all processes in the process
       group are signaled.

       The signaled process  must  belong  to  the  current  user
       unless the user is a privileged user.

       The  process  number  of each asynchronous process started
       with & is reported by the shell (unless more than one pro-
       cess is started in a pipeline, in which case the number of
       the last process in the pipeline  is  reported).   Process
       numbers can also be found by using

       Send signal to the selected processes.  If status is null,
       print a list of symbolic signal names that may be used  as
       signal.  If status is not null, it is either a return sta-
       tus from a process terminated by a signal (stored in the ?
       environment  variable for the most recently completed pro-
       cess), or a signal number. In both cases the symbolic name
       of  the  matching  signal  is printed.  This option is the
       same as -s signal.

       The -signal usage is for backward compatibility,  and  may
       not  be supported in future releases.  It should therefore
       be avoided.
