       nl  reads lines from the named file, or the standard input
       if no file is named, and reproduces the lines on the stan-
       dard output.  Lines are numbered on the left in accordance
       with the command options in effect.  nl processes  supple-
       mentary code set characters according to the locale speci-
       fied in the LC_CTYPE environment  variable  (see  LANG  on
       except  as  noted  below.  In regular expressions, pattern
       searches  are  performed  on  characters,  not  bytes,  as
       described on

       nl  views  the  text  it  reads in terms of logical pages.
       Line numbering is reset at the start of each logical page.
       A  logical page consists of a header, a body, and a footer
       section.  Empty sections are valid.  Different  line  num-
       bering  options  are  independently  available for header,
       body, and footer.  For example, -bt (the default)  numbers
       non-blank  lines  in  the body section and does not number
       any lines in the header and footer sections.

       The start of logical page sections are signaled  by  input
       lines containing nothing but the following delimiter char-
       acter(s): Start of header body footer

       Unless optioned otherwise, nl assumes the text being  read
       is in a single logical page body.

       Command  options may appear in any order and may be inter-
       mingled with an optional file name.  Only one file may  be
       named.

       If  POSIX2 is in the environment, then there is no default
       value for the options -b, -f, -h, -v, -i, -l, -s,  -w,  -n
       or  -d.   If  the value isn't immediately after the option
       variable, then it is the next argument.

       The options are: Specifies which logical page  body  lines
       are  to  be numbered.  Recognized types and their meanings
       are: number all lines number  lines  with  printable  text
       only  do  not  number lines number only lines that contain
       the basic regular expression (BRE) exp (see  Default  type
       for  logical  page  body  is t (text lines numbered).  All
       supplementary code set characters  are  considered  print-
       able.  Same as -btype except for footer.  Default type for
       logical page footer is n (no lines numbered).  All supple-
       mentary  code  set  characters  are  considered printable.
       Same as -btype except for header.  Default type for  logi-
       cal  page header is n (no lines numbered).  All supplemen-
       tary code set characters are considered printable.  start#
       is  the  initial  value used to number logical page lines.

                                                                1

       Default start# is 1.  incr is the increment value used  to
       number  logical  page  lines.   Default incr is 1.  Do not
       restart numbering at logical page delimiters.  num is  the
       number  of blank lines to be considered as one.  For exam-
       ple, -l2 results in only the second adjacent  blank  being
       numbered  (if  the appropriate -ha, -ba, and/or -fa option
       is set).  Default num is 1.  sep is the character(s)  used
       in  separating  the line number and the corresponding text
       line.  Default sep is a tab.  sep must  be  a  single-byte
       character  or  characters.  width is the number of charac-
       ters to be used for the line number.  Default width is  6.
       The  maximum  for  width is 100.  If a number greater than
       the maximum is specified for width, the maximum  is  auto-
       matically  used.   format  is  the  line numbering format.
       Recognized values are: ln, left justified, leading  zeroes
       suppressed;  rn,  right  justified,  leading  zeroes  sup-
       pressed;  rz,  right  justified,  leading   zeroes   kept.
       Default format is rn (right justified).  The two delimiter
       characters specifying the start of a logical page  section
       may  be  changed  from  the default characters (\:) to two
       user-specified  characters.   If  only  one  character  is
       entered,  the second character remains the default charac-
       ter (:).  No space should appear between the  -d  and  the
       delimiter characters.  To enter a backslash, use two back-
       slashes.  delim must be a single-byte character or charac-
       ters.

       The  command: nl -v10 -i10 -d!+ file1 will cause the first
       line of the page body to be numbered 10, the  second  line
       of  the  page body to be numbered 20, the third 30, and so
       forth.  The logical page delimiters are !+.
