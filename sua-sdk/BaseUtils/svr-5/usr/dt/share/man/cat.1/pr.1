       The  pr command formats and prints the contents of a file.
       If file is -, or if no files  are  specified,  pr  assumes
       standard  input.   The named files are printed on standard
       output.  pr processes supplementary code set characters in
       files, and recognizes supplementary code set characters in
       the character or string arguments given to the -e, -h, -i,
       -n,  and  -s  options  (see below) according to the locale
       specified in the LC_CTYPE environment variable  (see  LANG
       on  Multibyte  characters will not be split when lines are
       truncated or folded.

       By default, the listing  is  separated  into  pages,  each
       headed by the page number, the date and time that the file
       was last modified, and the name of the file.  Page  length
       is  66 lines which includes 10 lines of header and trailer
       output.  The header is composed of 2 blank lines,  1  line
       of  text (can be altered with -h), and 2 blank lines;  the
       trailer is 5 blank lines.  For single column output,  line
       width  may  not  be set and is unlimited.  For multicolumn
       output, line width may  be  set  and  the  default  is  72
       columns  (unless  -s is specified, in which case it is 512
       columns).   Diagnostic  reports   (failed   options)   are
       reported  at  the end of standard output associated with a
       terminal, rather than interspersed in the  output.   Pages
       are  separated  by  series  of line feeds rather than form
       feed characters.

       By default, columns are of equal width,  separated  by  at
       least one space; lines which do not fit are truncated.  If
       the -s option is used, columns are separated by the  sepa-
       rator character.

       Either -columns or -m should be used to produce multi-col-
       umn output.  -a should only be used with -columns and  not
       -m.

       Begin  printing  with  page  numbered page (default is 1).
       Print columns columns of output (default  is  1).   Output
       appears  as  if  -e and -i are on for multi-column output.
       May not use with -m.  Print multi-column output across the
       page  one  line  per column.  columns must be greater than
       one.  If a line is too long to fit  in  a  column,  it  is
       truncated.   Double-space  the  output.   Blank lines that

       result from double-spacing are dropped when they occur  at
       the  top  of a page.  Expand input tabs to character posi-
       tions k+1, 2*k+1, 3*k+1, and so on.  If k is 0 or is omit-
       ted,  default tab settings at every eighth column position
       are assumed.  Tab characters in  the  input  are  expanded
       into  the appropriate number of spaces.  If c is given, it
       is treated as the input tab character (default  for  c  is
       the tab character).  c must be a non-digit character.  Use
       a single form-feed character for new pages (default is  to
       use a sequence of line feeds).  Pause before beginning the
       first page if the standard output  is  associated  with  a
       terminal.  (See ``Notices'' below.)  Fold the lines of the
       input file.  When used in multi-column mode, (with the  -a
       or  -m  options)  lines  will be folded to fit the current
       column's width.  When used for single-column output,  (for
       example,  when  making  a  file printable on regular-sized
       paper) -F must be used with the -wwidth option (for  exam-
       ple,  -F  -w72).   (See ``Notices'' below.)  Use header as
       the text line of the header to be printed instead  of  the
       file  name.   -h  is  ignored  when  -t is specified or -l
       length is specified and the value of length is 10 or less.
       In  output,  replace two or more adjacent space characters
       wherever possible by inserting tabs to character positions
       k+1,  2*k+1,  3*k+1,  and so on.  If k is 0 or is omitted,
       default tab settings at every eighth column  position  are
       assumed.   If  c is given, it is treated as the output tab
       character (default for c is the tab character).  c must be
       a non-digit character.  Set the length of a page to length
       lines (default is  66).   A  length  of  0  specifies  the
       default  length.   By  default, output contains 5 lines of
       header and 5 lines of trailer leaving 56 lines  for  user-
       supplied  text.  When -l length is used and length exceeds
       10, then length-10 lines are left per page for  user  sup-
       plied text.  When length is 10 or less, header and trailer
       output is omitted to make room for user supplied text; see
       the  -t option.  Merge and print all files simultaneously,
       one per column.  The maximum number of files that  may  be
       specified is nine.  If a line is too long to fit in a col-
       umn, it is truncated.  May not use with -column.   Provide
       k-digit  line  numbering (default for k is 5).  The number
       occupies the first k+1 character positions of each  column
       of  single  column output or each line of -m output.  If c
       is given, it is appended to the line number to separate it
       from whatever follows (default for c is a tab).  c must be
       a non-digit character.  Offset each line by offset charac-
       ter  positions  (default  is  0).  The number of character
       positions per line is the sum of  the  width  and  offset.
       Pause before beginning each page if the output device is a
       terminal.  pr rings the terminal bell and waits for a car-
       riage  return.   Print no diagnostic reports on files that
       cannot be opened.  Separate columns by the single  charac-
       ter  separator  instead  of  by  the appropriate number of
       spaces (default for separator is a  tab).   Print  neither
       the five-line identifying header nor the five-line trailer

                                                                2

       normally supplied for each page.  Quit printing after  the
       last  line  of each file without spacing to the end of the
       page.  Use of -t overrides the -h option.  Set  the  width
       of  a  line to width character positions (default is 72 if
       -s is not specified, 512 if -s  is  specified).   This  is
       effective  only  for  multi-column output (-column and -m)
       and for single-column output when the -F option is used.

       If standard output is directed to one of the special files
       /dev/tty*,  then other output directed to this terminal is
       delayed until standard output is completed.  This prevents

       The pr command automatically  converts  ^Ls  (form  feeds)
       into  multiple  newlines.   It also will interpret control
       characters that printf (see interprets.

       Set the POSIX2 environment variable to get POSIX.2  behav-
       ior  that is inconsistent with existing System V behavior.
       When POSIX2 is set, -F behaves the same as -f; no  folding
       option is available in this case.
