       fmt  is a simple text formatter that fills and joins lines
       to produce output lines of (up to) the number  of  charac-
       ters  specified in the -w width option.  The default width
       is 72.  fmt concatenates the inputfiles  listed  as  argu-
       ments.  If none are given, fmt formats text from the stan-
       dard input.

       Blank lines are preserved in the output, as is the spacing
       between words.  fmt does not fill lines beginning with a .
       (dot), for compatibility with nroff.   Nor  does  it  fill
       lines starting with From:.

       Indentation  is  preserved  in the output, and input lines
       with differing indentation are not joined  (unless  -c  is
       used).

       fmt  can also be used as an in-line text filter for the vi
       command: !}fmt reformats the text between the cursor loca-
       tion and the end of the paragraph.

       Crown  margin mode.  Preserve the indentation of the first
       two lines within a paragraph, and align the left margin of
       each  subsequent  line with that of the second line.  This
       is useful for tagged paragraphs.  Split  lines  only.   Do
       not  join  short lines to form longer ones.  This prevents
       sample lines of code, and  other  such  "formatted"  text,
       from  being  unduly  combined.  Fill output lines to up to
       width columns.

       The -w width option is acceptable for  BSD  compatibility,
       but it may go away in future releases.
