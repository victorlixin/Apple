       ckuid prompts a  user  and  validates  the  response.   It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response should be an existing user ID, text for help  and
       error  messages, and a default value (which is returned if
       the user responds with a ).

       All messages are limited in length to  70  characters  and
       are  formatted automatically.  Any white space used in the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels  the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is placed
       at the beginning or  end  of  a  message  definition,  the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If the prompt, help or error message is not  defined,  the
       default  message  (as  defined  under ``Notices'') is dis-
       played.

       Three visual tool modules are linked to the ckuid command.
       They  are erruid (which formats and displays an error mes-
       sage), helpuid (which formats and  displays  a  help  mes-
       sage),  and  valuid  (which  validates a response).  These
       modules should be used in conjunction  with  FML  objects.
       In this instance, the FML object defines the prompt.

       The  options  and  arguments  for this command are: Do not
       allow quit as a valid response.  Use  width  as  the  line
       length  for  prompt,  help, and error messages.  Display a
       list of all logins when help is requested or when the user
       makes  an  error.   The  default  value  is  default.  The
       default is not validated and so does not have to meet  any
       criteria.  The help message is help.  The error message is
       error.  The prompt message is prompt.  Send process ID pid
       a  signal if the user chooses to abort.  When quit is cho-
       sen, send signal to the process whose pid is specified  by
       the  -k  option.   If no signal is specified, use SIGTERM.

       The  default  prompt for ckuid is: Enter the login name of
       an existing user [?,q] The default error message is: ERROR
       -  Please  enter  the login name of an existing user.  (If
       the -m option of ckuid is used, a list of valid  users  is
       also displayed.)

       The  default  help message is: Please enter the login name
       of an existing user.  (If the -m option of ckuid is  used,
       a list of valid users is also displayed.)

       When  the  quit  option  is  chosen  (and  allowed),  q is
       returned along with the return code 3.  The valuid  module
       does  not produce any output.  It returns zero for success
       and non-zero for failure.
