       nice [-increment | -n increment] command [arguments]

       nice  executes  command with a lower CPU scheduling prior-
       ity.  The command is a more general interface to scheduler
       functions.

       The  invoking process (generally the user's shell) must be
       in the time-sharing scheduling class.  The command is exe-
       cuted in the time-sharing class.

       If the -increment (or -n increment) argument (in the range
       1-19) is given, it is used; if not, an increment of 10  is
       assumed.

       The user with appropriate privileges may run commands with
       priority higher than normal by using a negative increment,
       for example, --10.

       An increment larger than 19 is equivalent to 19.
