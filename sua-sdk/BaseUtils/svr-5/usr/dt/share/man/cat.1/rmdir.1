       rmdir removes the entries for the named directories, which
       must not be empty.

       rmdir has the following options: This option allows  users
       to remove the directory dirname and its parent directories
       which become empty.  A  message  is  printed  on  standard
       error  about  whether the whole path is removed or part of
       the path remains for some reason.  This option is used  to
       suppress  the message printed on standard error when -p is
       in effect.  If the environment  variable  POSIX2  is  set,
       this  option  is  on by default (i.e., standard error mes-
       sages are always suppressed).

       All messages are generally self-explanatory.

       It is forbidden to remove the directories  .  and  ..   in
       order  to  avoid  the  consequences of inadvertently doing
       something like the following: rm -r .*  rmdir  returns  an
       exit  code  of  0  if  all  the  specified directories are
       removed successfully.  Otherwise, they return  a  non-zero
       exit code.

       A  --  permits  the user to mark explicitly the end of any
       command line options, allowing rmdir to recognize filename
       arguments  that  begin  with a -.  As an aid to BSD migra-
       tion, rmdir will accept -  as  a  synonym  for  --.   This
       migration  aid may disappear in a future release.  If a --
       and a - both appear on the same command line,  the  second
       will be interpreted as a filename.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
