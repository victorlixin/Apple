       ckyorn prompts a user  and  validates  the  response.   It
       defines, among other things, a prompt message for a yes or
       no answer, text for help and error messages, and a default
       value (which is returned if the user responds with a ).

       All  messages  are  limited in length to 70 characters and
       are formatted automatically.  Any white space used in  the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels the automatic  formatting.   For  the  -h  and  -e
       options, placing a tilde at the beginning or end of a mes-
       sage definition causes the default text to be inserted  at
       that  point.  This allows both custom text and the default
       text to be displayed.

       If the prompt, help or error message is not  defined,  the
       default  message  (as  defined  under ``Notices'') is dis-
       played.

       Three visual tool modules are linked to  the  ckyorn  com-
       mand.   They  are  erryorn  (which formats and displays an
       error message), helpyorn (which  formats  and  displays  a
       help  message),  and valyorn (which validates a response).
       These modules should be  used  in  conjunction  with  FMLI
       objects.   In  this  instance, the FMLI object defines the
       prompt.

       The options and arguments for this  command  are:  Do  not
       allow  quit  as  a  valid response.  Use width as the line
       length for prompt, help, and error messages.  The  default
       value  is  default.   The  default is not validated and so
       does not have to meet any criteria.  The help  message  is
       help.   The error message is error.  The prompt message is
       prompt.  Send process ID pid a signal if the user  chooses
       to abort.  When quit is chosen, send signal to the process
       whose pid is specified by the -k option.  If no signal  is
       specified,  use  SIGTERM.  Input to be verified as y, yes,
       Y, Yes, YES or n, no, N, No, NO.

       The  default prompt for ckyorn is: Yes or No [y,n,?,q] The
       default error message is: ERROR - Please enter yes or  no.
       The default help message is: Enter y or yes if your answer
       is yes; or no if your answer is no.  When the quit  option
       is  chosen  (and  allowed),  q  is returned along with the
       return code 3.  The valyorn module does  not  produce  any
       output.   It  returns  zero  for  success and non-zero for
       failure.
