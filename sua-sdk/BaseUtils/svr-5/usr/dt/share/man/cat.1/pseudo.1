       The  pseudo  command  provides a STREAMS interface on non-
       STREAMS tty devices.  It opens a master pseudo-tty  device
       (/dev/ptmx)  and a slave pseudo-tty device (/dev/pts/???).
       It pushes the pseudo-terminal emulation module then a line
       discipline  module,  by default, onto the slave to connect
       the master and the slave.  (The stream may be subsequently
       manipulated  with  other  commands  to provide the desired
       configuration.)  pseudo then  forks  to  become  two  pro-
       cesses.   One reads from the user's tty line and writes to
       the pseudo-tty; the other reads from  the  pseudo-tty  and
       writes to the user's tty.  On the pseudo-tty side, a shell
       is executed.

       pseudo accepts the following options:  Execute  a  ``login
       shell''  (executed as -sh).  By default, pseudo executes a
       simple interactive shell (sh -i).   Push  line  discipline
       module line instead of the default ldterm module.  At most
       one line discipline is pushed.

       The effect of running pseudo is that the user  obtains  an
       interactive shell with the standard I/O files connected to
       a STREAMS device that behaves as a real tty.  This is use-
       ful  in situations where a STREAMS device is desired but a
       non-STREAMS device driver is being used.

       When the executed shell exits, pseudo  exits  and  control
       returns  to the original tty with the original parameters.
