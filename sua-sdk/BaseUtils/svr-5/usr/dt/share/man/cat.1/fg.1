       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the shell.  See for  more  informa-
       tion on this shell.

       If  job  control is enabled (see the description of set -m
       on the manual page), the fg command moves a background job
       from  the  current  shell's execution environment into the
       foreground.

       Using fg to place a job into the  foreground  will  remove
       its  process ID from the list of those ``known in the cur-
       rent shell execution environment''.  See the  ``Commands''
       and  ``Jobs''  subsections  of  the  manual  page for more
       information on asynchronous command execution and job con-
       trol.

   OOppeerraannddss
       Specify  the  job  to  be  run as a foreground job.  If no
       job_id operand is given, the job_id of the  job  that  was
       most  recently  suspended, placed in the background or run
       as a background job will be used.  Background jobs for the
       current shell can be displayed using the or commands.

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of bg: Provide a default value for  the  internationaliza-
       tion  variables  that are unset or null.  If LANG is unset
       or null, the corresponding value from the  implementation-
       specific  default  locale  will  be  used.   If any of the
       internationalization variables contains  an  invalid  set-
       ting,  the utility will behave as if none of the variables
       had been defined.  If set to  a  non-empty  string  value,
       override  the values of all the other internationalization
       variables.  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
       sequences  of  bytes of text data as characters (for exam-
       ple, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters in  argu-
       ments).   Determine  the  locale  that  should  be used to
       affect the format  and  contents  of  diagnostic  messages
       written to standard error.

       The fg command writes the command line of the job to stan-
       dard output.

       An exit code of 0 indicates successful completion; an exit
       code greater than 0 indicates an error.

       error and no job will be placed in the foreground.

UUssaaggee
       The fg utility will not work as expected when it is  oper-
       ating  in  its  own  utility execution environment because
       that environment will have no applicable jobs  to  manipu-
       late;  see the ``Usage'' section of the manual page.
