       The setsizecvt command generates files in the space format
       for sets.  Before sets were included as packaging objects,
       the  installation  tools  used  space files to specify any
       additional space the packages  required,  in  addition  to
       that  listed in the entries in that package's pkgmap file.

       The setsizecvt command was designed to  be  as  simple  as
       possible; the packaging tools process the sets in much the
       same way they process packages.

       Executing in a set's  installation  directory,  setsizecvt
       collects  the  space  file  (if it exists) and the setsize
       file from each of the packages included in that set.   The
       setsize file is a file whose entries are formatted as fol-
       lows: pkg:/path/name #blks     #inodes where  pkg  is  the
       short form of the package name, and the rest is the direc-
       tory and number of blocks and inodes used in  that  direc-
       tory.  This setsize file is created when the sets are cre-
       ated.  Typically, the setsize file for a given  set  would
       be  created  from the pkgmap files for all of the packages
       in that set.

       setsizecvt selects those entries in the setsize  file  for
       packages  (in  the  current  set)  that  the user wants to
       install.  Those entries are then collected in a  new  file
       called space.

       pkgadd uses the space file to see if there is enough space
       on the disk to install the set.  The space file for a  set
       is treated the same way as it is in a package.
