       cdc changes the delta comment, for the SID (SCCS identifi-
       cation string) specified by  the  -r  keyletter,  of  each
       named SCCS file.

       The  delta  comment  is  the Modification Request (MR) and
       comment information normally specified via the -m  and  -y
       keyletters of the delta command.

       If file is a directory, cdc behaves as though each file in
       the directory were specified as a named file, except  that
       non-SCCS  files  (last component of the path name does not
       begin with s.)  and unreadable files are silently ignored.
       If  a  name of - is given, the standard input is read (see
       the ``Notices'' section) and each  line  of  the  standard
       input  is  taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be pro-
       cessed.

       Arguments to cdc, which may appear in any  order,  consist
       of keyletter arguments and file names.

       All  the described keyletter arguments apply independently
       to each named file: Used to specify the  SCCS  identifica-
       tion  (SID)  string of a delta for which the delta comment
       is to be changed.  If the SCCS file has  the  v  flag  set
       (see  then a list of MR numbers to be added and/or deleted
       in the delta comment  of  the  SID  specified  by  the  -r
       keyletter  may be supplied.  A null MR list has no effect.

       mrlist entries are added to the list of MRs  in  the  same
       manner  as  that of delta.  In order to delete an MR, pre-
       cede the MR number with the character ! (see  the  ``Exam-
       ples''  section).  If the MR to be deleted is currently in
       the list of MRs, it is removed and changed into a  comment
       line.   A list of all deleted MRs is placed in the comment
       section of the delta comment and  preceded  by  a  comment
       line stating that they were deleted.

       If  -m  is  not used and the standard input is a terminal,
       the prompt MRs?  is issued on the standard  output  before
       the standard input is read; if the standard input is not a
       terminal, no prompt is issued.   The  MRs?  prompt  always
       precedes the comments? prompt (see -y keyletter).

       mrlist  entries  in  a list are separated by blanks and/or
       tab characters.  An unescaped  new-line  character  termi-
       nates the MR list.

       Note that if the v flag has a value (see it is taken to be
       the name of a program (or shell procedure) that  validates
       the  correctness  of  the  MR numbers.  If a non-zero exit

                                                                1

cdc(1)                                                     cdc(1)

       status is returned from the MR number validation  program,
       cdc  terminates  and  the delta comment remains unchanged.
       Arbitrary text used  to  replace  the  comment(s)  already
       existing for the delta specified by the -r keyletter.  The
       previous comments are kept and preceded by a comment  line
       stating  that  they  were  changed.  A null comment has no
       effect.

       If -y is not specified and the standard input is a  termi-
       nal, the prompt comments? is issued on the standard output
       before the standard input is read; if the  standard  input
       is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.  An unescaped new-
       line character terminates the comment text.

       If you made the delta and have the appropriate  file  per-
       missions,  you  can  change its delta comment.  If you own
       the file and directory you can modify the delta comment.

       bl87-54321  from  the MR list, and add the comment trouble
       to  delta  1.6  of   s.file:   cdc   -r1.6   -m"bl88-12345

       If SCCS file names are supplied to the cdc command via the
       standard input (- on the command line), then the -m and -y
       keyletters must also be used.
