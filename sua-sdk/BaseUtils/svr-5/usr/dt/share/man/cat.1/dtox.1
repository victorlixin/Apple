       The  dtox  command converts a file from  format to format.
       files terminate a line of text with a carriage return  and
       a  linefeed, while  files terminate a line with a linefeed
       only. Also  places a z at the end of a file,  while   sys-
       tems do not.  Some programs and utilities are sensitive to
       this difference and some are not. If a text or  data  file
       is  not being interpreted correctly, then use the dtox and
       xtod conversion utilities.  The dtox  command  strips  the
       extra carriage return from the end of each line and strips
       the z from the end  of  the  file.  This  utility  is  not
       required for binary object files.

       If  no  filename  is  specified  on the command line, dtox
       takes input from standard input.  Output  of  the  utility
       goes to standard output.
