       The  mimencode  program is a format translator that simply
       converts a byte stream into (or out of) one of  the  stan-
       dard  mail  encoding formats defined by MIME, the proposed
       standard for Internet multimedia mail formats.

       By default, mimencode reads from the  standard  input  and
       sends  a  base64-encoded  version of the input to standard
       output.

   OOppttiioonnss
       mimencode uses the following  command  line  options:  Use
       base64  encoding  (not  necessary to specify since this is
       the default).  Use the quoted-printable  encoding  instead
       of  base64.   Decode standard input rather than encode it.
       Translate decoded CRLF sequences into  the  local  newline
       convention  during  decoding  and to do the reverse during
       encoding.  This option is only meaningful when -b  (base64
       encoding)  is in effect.  If a filename is specified, read
       input from the named file rather than from standard input.

UUssaaggee
       MIME  encoding  is used because binary data cannot be sent
       through the mail.  The encodings understood  by  mimencode
       may  be preferable to those used by uuencode and uudecode.

       mimencode is intended to replace  uuencode  for  mail  and
       news  use,  primarily  because uuencode may use characters
       that do not translate well across all mail gateways  (par-
       ticularly ASCII/EBCDIC gateways).

       mimencode  implements the encodings which were defined for
       MIME as uuencode replacements and is expected to  be  more
       robust for email use.
