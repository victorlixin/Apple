       The  regcmp  command performs a function similar to regcmp
       and, in most cases, precludes the need for calling  regcmp
       from C programs.  Bypassing regcmp saves on both execution
       time and program size.  The command  regcmp  compiles  the
       regular  expressions  in  file  and  places  the output in
       file.i.  If the - option is used, the output is placed  in
       file.c.   The format of entries in file is a name (C vari-
       able) followed by one or more blanks followed  by  one  or
       more  regular  expressions enclosed in double quotes.  The
       output of regcmp  is  C  source  code.   Compiled  regular
       expressions   are  represented  as  extern  char  vectors.
       file.i files may thus  be  #included  in  C  programs,  or
       file.c  files  may be compiled and later loaded.  In the C
       program  that  uses  the  regcmp  output,  regex(abc,line)
       applies  the  regular expression named abc to line.  Diag-
       nostics are self-explanatory.  regcmp processes supplemen-
       tary  code set characters in files according to the locale
       specified in the LC_CTYPE environment variable  (see  LANG
       on  Pattern  searches  are  performed  on  characters, not
       bytes, as described on A backslash in the input quotes the
       next  character(s).   The  recognized  characters that can
       follow a backslash are n, t, r, b, up to three octal  dig-
       its,  and  another backslash.  Any other character is sent
       through unchanged, but the backslash is removed.

       name      "([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*)$0"

       telno     "\\({0,1}([2-9][01][1-9])$0\\){0,1} *"
                 "([2-9][0-9]{2})$1[-]{0,1}"
                 "([0-9]{4})$2"  The  three  arguments  to  telno
       shown above must all be entered on one line.

       In the C program that uses the regcmp output, regex(telno,
       line, area, exch, rest)  applies  the  regular  expression
       named telno to line.
