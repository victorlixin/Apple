       The  udimkpkg  utility assembles UDI-encoded driver source
       code and related  files  into  a  conforming  UDI  package
       directory structure according to the build rules set forth
       in the static driver properties file  udiprops.txt.   When
       this  command  is run from the directory containing all of
       the input files and with no command-line options, udimkpkg
       creates  a  UDI package file in the current working direc-
       tory named name_string.udi where name_string is the short-
       name   declaration   in   udiprops.txt.    It  parses  the
       udiprops.txt file contained in that directory and  creates
       UDI packaging in directory format in a new directory, udi-
       pkg.1, also in the current directory.

       The following command-line options are understood: Specify
       the name of the package alternate as str.  By default, str
       is the release declaration in udiprops.txt.   Specify  the
       name  of the package component as str.  By default, str is
       the module declaration in udiprops.txt.  If there are mul-
       tiple  module  declarations for a component, the first one
       is used.  Specify the name of the driver  being  packaged.
       Display the help message.  Display the full usage informa-
       tion.  Do a dry run of udimkpkg. Used with the -v  option,
       commands  are  not  executed.   Commands  are echoed only.
       Specify output  directory  dir.   By  default,  output  is
       directed  to the current working directory.  Overwrite any
       existing output package file.  Specify  distribution  type
       with  keywd.   keywd  can  be  both  (default), source, or
       binary.  Specify a temporary directory dir for udimkpkg to
       use.   By default, this directory is /tmp.  Update/combine
       into existing output package file.  Specify  verbose  out-
       put.  Display the help message.
