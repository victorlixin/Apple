       The  dis  command produces an assembly language listing or
       dump of file, which may be an object file or an archive of
       object  files.   The  listing includes assembly statements
       and an octal or hexadecimal representation of  the  binary
       that produced those statements.

       The  following options are interpreted by the disassembler
       and may be specified in any order.

       Start the dump or disassembly at addr, a decimal, octal or
       hexadecimal number.

       Limit  the  disassembly to cnt instructions or the dump to
       cnt data bytes.  cnt is a decimal,  octal  or  hexadecimal
       number.

       (Obsolete)  Dump  the  named section as data, printing the
       offset as relative to the section start.  If the  optional
       +offset is present, start instead at offset bytes into the
       section.

       (Obsolete) Dump the named section as  data,  printing  the
       virtual address as the offset.  If the optional +offset is
       present, start instead at offset bytes into  the  section.
       offset is a decimal, octal or hexadecimal number.

       Specify  format of instruction output, where fmt is one or
       more of the following characters:  specifies  the  default
       format  (abl)  include the instruction address include the
       instruction raw bytes specifies the compact  format  (just
       instructions)  - cannot be combined with other fmt charac-
       ters specifies full format (ablt) include source line num-
       bers  if available include source text and line numbers if
       available

       Disassemble either the function symbol or dump the  object
       symbol.  If the optional +offset is present, start instead
       at offset bytes into the symbol.   offset  is  a  decimal,
       octal  or  hexadecimal  number.   By default, if symbol is
       found in a writable section, it is assumed  not  to  be  a
       function.

       (Obsolete)  Disassemble  or  dump  a  file named libname.a
       found using the default ld(1) library search path.

       (Obsolete) No effect.

       Disassemble or dump the named section, using  the  virtual

                                                                1

dis(1)                                                     dis(1)

       address  as  the  offset.  If the optional +offset is pre-
       sent, start instead at  offset  bytes  into  the  section.
       offset  is  a  decimal,  octal  or hexadecimal number.  By
       default, if section  is  writable  its  contents  will  be
       dumped as data.

       Print offsets in octal instead of hexadecimal.

       Specify  the decode model, where output is one of the fol-
       lowing: forces a data dump forces a disassembly,  guessing
       the correct instruction decoding forces a disassembly tak-
       ing the content as Intel IA-32  instructions  with  32-bit
       data  and  address  sizes  forces a disassembly taking the
       content as Intel IA-32 instructions with 16-bit  data  and
       address sizes

       Append  symbolic disassembly information when possible and
       appropriate.

       (Obsolete) Disassemble the named section  as  data,  using
       the  virtual address as the offset.  If the optional +off-
       set is present, start instead at  offset  bytes  into  the
       section.   offset  is a decimal, octal or hexadecimal num-
       ber.

       Print,  on  standard  error,  the  disassembler's  version
       information.

       Specify  the  dump word size to be sz, a decimal, octal or
       hexadecimal number which must be equal to 1, 2, 4 or 8.

       If given no options, dis will disassemble all  nonwritable
       sections  for  each  file.   The  -d, -D, -n or -t options
       restrict dis to operate only on the named section.   Simi-
       larly,  the -F option restricts dis to operate only on the
       named symbol, only one of which will  be  present  in  any
       object file.

       On  output,  a  number  enclosed in square brackets at the
       beginning of a line,  such  as  [5],  indicates  that  the
       break-pointable  line  number  starts  with  the following
       instruction.  These line numbers will be printed  only  if
       the  file  was compiled with additional debugging informa-
       tion (for example, the -g option of  cc).   An  expression
       such  as <40> in the operand field or in the symbolic dis-
       assembly, following a relative  displacement  for  control
       transfer  instructions, is the computed address within the
       section to which control will be transferred.  A  function
       name  will  appear  in the first column, followed by () if
       the object file contains a symbol table.   When  debugging
       information is present, the function name will be prefixed
       by file@, indicating the originating source file.

                                                                2

       The self-explanatory diagnostics indicate  errors  in  the
       command  line  or  problems encountered with the specified

       At this time, symbolic disassembly does not take advantage
       of  additional  information  available if the file is com-
       piled with the -g option.

       This command has been updated to handle Intel Pentium  III
       Streaming SIMD instructions;  see for more information.
