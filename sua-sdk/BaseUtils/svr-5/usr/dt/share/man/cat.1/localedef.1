       The  localedef  command  converts  source  definitions for
       locale categories into a format usable  by  the  functions
       and utilities whose operational behaviour is determined by
       the setting of the locale environment variables defined in

       The  command  reads  source  definitions  for  one or more
       locale categories belonging to the same  locale  from  the
       file  named  in the -i option (if specified) or from stan-
       dard  input.   The  name  operand  identifies  the  target
       locale.   The  localedef  utility supports the creation of
       public, or generally accessible locales, as well  as  pri-
       vate, or restricted-access locales.  Creation or modifica-
       tion of public locales is limited to users with the appro-
       priate privileges.

       Each  category source definition is identified by the cor-
       responding environment variable name and terminated by  an
       END category-name statement.  The following categories are
       supported.  Defines character classification and case con-
       version.  Defines collation rules.  Defines the format and
       symbols  used  in  formatting  of  monetary   information.
       Defines  the decimal delimiter, grouping and grouping sym-
       bol for non-monetary numeric editing.  Defines the  format
       and  content  of  date  and time information.  Defines the
       format and values of affirmative and negative responses.

       The following options are supported: Create permanent out-
       put  even  if  warning messages have been issued.  Specify
       the pathname of a file containing a mapping  of  character
       symbols  and collating element symbols to actual character
       encodings.  This option  must  be  specified  if  symbolic
       names  (other  than collating symbols defined in a collat-
       ing-symbol keyword) are used.  See If the -f option is not
       present, the character mapping for the default C locale is
       used.  The pathname of a file containing the source  defi-
       nitions.   If  this  option is not present, source defini-
       tions will be read from standard  input.   Do  not  create
       output.   This option is useful for debugging source defi-
       nitions.

       The name operand identifies the locale.  If the name  con-
       tains  one  or  more slash characters, name will be inter-
       preted as a pathname where the created locale  definitions
       will  be stored.  If name does not contain any slash char-
       acters, the locale is created in /usr/lib/locale  and  the
       locale  will  be public.  This capability is restricted to
       users with appropriate privileges.  (As a  consequence  of
       specifying  one  name,  although several categories can be

                                                                1

       processed in one execution, only categories  belonging  to
       the same locale can be processed.)

       Unless the -i option is specified, the standard input must
       be a text file containing  one  or  more  locale  category
       source  definitions.   When  lines are continued using the
       escape character mechanism,  there  is  no  limit  to  the
       length of the accumulated continued line.

       Locale    information    is    kept   in   the   directory
       /usr/lib/locale.

       If a locale category source  definition  contains  a  copy
       statement,  and the copy statement names a valid, existing
       locale, then localedef will behave as if the source  defi-
       nition  had  contained  a valid category source definition
       for the named locale.

       The character set mapping file specified  as  the  charmap
       option-argument  is  described in X/Open Interface Defini-
       tions, Version 4  Issue  2,  Section  4.4,  Character  Set
       Description File.

       The character mapping mehcanism has been extended from the
       standard to more easily handle UTF and EUC encodings.  Any
       of  the  following  directives are accepted in the charmap
       file:       <encoding>     none       <encoding>     utf-8
       <encoding>     euc  m1:d1,m2:d2,m3:d3 where the default is
       none for  single-byte  locales  and  utf-8  for  multibyte
       locales.   If  the  encoding  directive  for  utf-8 is not
       included in the file, you can use \Uhhhh  in  a  character
       definition  to  force  UTF  encoding  for  that  character
       (replace hhhh with hexadecimal integers).

       The third form of the directive must be specified for  EUC
       encodings.   In the third form, the arguments must specify
       the number of bytes in the multibyte sequence (not includ-
       ing the SS2 or SS3) and the display width; one set of val-
       ues must be provided for each of codesets 1, 2, and 3.

       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of  locale: Provide a default value for the international-
       ization variables that are unset  or  null.   If  LANG  is
       unset  or null, the corresponding value from the default C
       locale will be used.  If any of  the  internationalization
       variables  contains  an  invalid setting, the utility will
       behave as if none of the variables had been  defined.   If
       set  to  a  non-empty string value, override the values of
       all the other internationalization  variables.   Determine
       the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
       text data as characters (for example, single as opposed to

                                                                2

localedef(1)                                         localedef(1)

       multi-byte characters in arguments).  Determine the locale
       that should be used to affect the format and  contents  of
       diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       The utility reports all categories successfully processed.

       The following exit values are returned: No errors occurred
       and  the  locales  were  successfully  created.   Warnings
       occurred and the locales were successfully  created.   The
       locale specification exceeded implementation limits or the
       coded character set or sets used  are  not  supported;  no
       locale  was created.  The capability to create new locales
       is not supported.  Warnings or errors occurred and no out-
       put was created.

       If  an error is detected, no permanent output will be cre-
       ated.  If warnings occur, permanent output will be created
       if  the -c option was specified.  The following conditions
       will cause warning messages to be issued:  If  a  symbolic
       name  not  found  in  the  charmap  file  is  used for the
       descriptions of the LC_CTYPE or LC_COLLATE categories (for
       other  categories,  this will be an error conditions).  If
       the number of operands to the order  keyword  exceeds  the
       COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX  limit.   If  keywords  not supported are
       present in the source.

       The charmap definition is optional, and is contained  out-
       side  the  locale definition.  This allows both completely
       self-defined source files, and generic sources (applicable
       to  more  than  one  codeset).   To  aid  portability, all
       charmap definitions must use the same symbolic  names  for
       the portable character set.
