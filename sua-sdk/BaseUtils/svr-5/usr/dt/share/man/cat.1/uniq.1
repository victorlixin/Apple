       uniq reads the input file and compares adjacent lines.  By
       default, the second  and  succeeding  copies  of  repeated
       lines  are removed; the remainder is written on the output
       file;  input  and  output  should  always  be   different.
       Repeated lines must be adjacent in order to be found; see

       uniq processes supplementary code set characters according
       to the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment  vari-
       able (see LANG on

       uniq  takes  the  following options: Output only the lines
       that are not repeated in the original  file.   Output  one
       copy  of  just  the repeated lines.  The default output is
       the union of the -u and -d outputs.  Generate the  default
       output  but with each line preceded by a count of the num-
       ber of times it occurred.  The -c option supersedes -u and
       -d.

       The  following options specify skipping an initial portion
       of each line in the comparison: Ignore  the  first  fields
       fields  together  with  any  blanks  before each field.  A
       field is defined as a string of non-space, non-tab charac-
       ters  separated  by tabs and spaces from its neighbors. If
       fields specifies a field that is not present in the  input
       line,  it  is  treated as a null string.  Ignore the first
       chars characters.  Fields are skipped  before  characters.
       If  chars  specifies more characters than are on the input
       line, the missing characters are treated as a null string.
