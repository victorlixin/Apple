       The  ln command links filen to target by creating a direc-
       tory entry that refers to target.  By using ln with one or
       more  file names, the user may create one or more links to
       target.

       The ln command may be used to create both hard  links  and
       symbolic  links; by default it creates hard links.  A hard
       link to a file  is  indistinguishable  from  the  original
       directory  entry.   Any  changes  to  a file are effective
       independent of the name used to reference the file.   Hard
       links  may  not  span  file  systems  and may not refer to
       directories.

       Without the -s option, ln is used to  create  hard  links.
       filen  is  linked  to  target.   If target is a directory,
       another file named filen is created in target  and  linked
       to  the  original filen.  If target is a file that already
       exists, its contents are overwritten.

       There are three options to ln.  If  multiple  options  are
       specified,  the  one with the highest priority is used and
       the remainder are ignored.   The  options,  in  descending
       order of priority, are: ln will create a symbolic link.  A
       symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is
       linked.   Symbolic  links  may  span  file systems and may
       refer to directories.  If the linkname exists, then do not
       overwrite  the  contents  of  the file.  A symbolic link's
       permissions are always set to  read,  write,  and  execute
       permission for owner, group, and world (777).

       If  the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed and run-
       ning, and the file system is of type sfs, the new file  is
       given  the  Mandatory  Access  Control level of the parent
       directory in which the file is created.  The level of  the
       new file must be within the level range of the file system
       in which it is created or the calling  process  must  have
       the P_FSYSRANGE privilege.

       Control  checks depend on the security level of the refer-
       enced file when following a symbolic link, while the level
       of the symbolic link is ignored.  ln will link files with-
       out generating any errors, even if the mode  of  the  file
       target  forbids  writing.   Note,  however, that if target
       refers to a  directory  that  has  no  write  permissions,
       errors  will  still occur.  If the linkname is an existing
       file, do not overwrite the contents of the file.   The  -f

                                                                1

ln(1)                                                       ln(1)

       option  overrides  this  option.  If the -s option is used
       with two arguments, target may be an existing directory or
       a  non-existent file.  If target already exists and is not
       a directory, an error is returned.  filen may be any  path
       name  and  need not exist.  If it exists, it may be a file
       or directory and may reside on  a  different  file  system
       from  target.   If target is an existing directory, a file
       is created in directory target whose name is filen or  the
       last  component  of  filen.   This file is a symbolic link
       that references filen.  If target does not exist,  a  file
       with  the name target is created and it is a symbolic link
       that references filen.

       If the -s option is used with  more  than  two  arguments,
       target  must  be an existing directory or an error will be
       returned.  For each filen, a file  is  created  in  target
       whose  name is filen or its last component; each new filen
       is a symbolic link to the original filen.  The  files  and
       target may reside on different file systems.

       Doing  operations  that  involve  ..  (such as cd ..) in a
       directory that is symbolically linked will  reference  the
       original directory not the target.

       The  -s option does not use the current working directory.
       In the command ln -s path target, path is taken  literally
       without being evaluated against the current working direc-
       tory.

       If the POSIX2 environment variable is  set  and  exported,
       the behavior of ln with no options is the same as the cur-
       rent ln -n.

       The -n option is  for  backward  compatibility  only.   It
       should  not  be  used,  since  it may be removed in future
       releases.

       Use the POSIX2 environment variable to get POSIX.2  behav-
       ior  that is inconsistent with existing System V behavior.
       POSIX2 requires no prompting in case of existing target.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
