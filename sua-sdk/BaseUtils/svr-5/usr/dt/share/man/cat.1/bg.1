       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the  /u95/bin/sh  shell.   See  for
       more information on this shell.

       If  job  control is enabled (see the description of set -m
       on the manual page), the bg utility resumes suspended jobs
       from  the  current  shell  environment  by running them as
       background jobs.

       If the job specified by job_id is already a running  back-
       ground  job,  the  bg  utility has no effect and will exit
       successfully.  Using bg to place a job into the background
       causes  its  process  ID  to become ``known in the current
       shell execution environment'', as if it had  been  started
       as  an  asynchronous  list.   See  for more information on
       asynchronous command execution and job control.

       The job_id parameter specifies the process ID of  the  job
       to  be  resumed as a background job.  If no job_id operand
       is given, the most recently suspended job is used.   Back-
       ground  jobs  for the current shell can be displayed using
       the or commands.

       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of  bg:  Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
       tion variables that are unset or null.  If LANG  is  unset
       or  null, the corresponding value from the implementation-
       specific default locale will  be  used.   If  any  of  the
       internationalization  variables  contains  an invalid set-
       ting, the utility will behave as if none of the  variables
       had  been  defined.   If  set to a non-empty string value,
       override the values of all the other  internationalization
       variables.  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
       sequences of bytes of text data as characters  (for  exam-
       ple,  single- as opposed to multi-byte characters in argu-
       ments).  Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
       affect  the  format  and  contents  of diagnostic messages
       written to standard error.

       The output of  bg  consists  of  a  line  in  the  format:
       job-id    command  where the fields are as follows: A num-
       ber that can be used to identify the job to the and utili-
       ties.  The associated command that was given to the shell.

       An exit code of 0 indicates successful completion; an exit
       code greater than 0 indicates an error.

       If  job control is disabled, the bg utility will exit with
       an error and no job will be placed in the background.

       A job is generally suspended by typing the SUSP  character
       (-Z  on  most  systems);  this  can  be  set and displayed
       through the command.  At that point, bg can  put  the  job
       into  the background.  This is most effective when the job
       is expecting no terminal input and  its  output  has  been
       redirected to non-terminal files.  A background job can be
       forced to stop when it has terminal output by issuing  the
       command:  stty tostop A background job can be stopped with
       the command: kill -s stop job ID

       The bg utility will not work as expected when it is  oper-
       ating  in  its  own  utility execution environment because
       that environment will have no suspended jobs.  In the fol-
       lowing examples: . . . | xargs bg (bg) each bg operates in
       a different environment and  will  not  share  its  parent
       shell's understanding of jobs.
