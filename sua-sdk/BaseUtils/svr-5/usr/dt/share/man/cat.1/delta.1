       delta is used to introduce changes  into  the  named  SCCS
       file;  file  must  have been retrieved previously by using
       get -e (called the g.file or generated  file).   The  file
       name  specified  must be in the form s.file or be the name
       of a directory.  If a directory is named, delta behaves as
       though  each  file  in  the  directory were specified as a
       named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component  of
       the  path  name  does  not  begin with s.)  and unreadable
       files are silently ignored.  If a name of - is given,  the
       standard input is read (see the ``Notices'' section); each
       line of the standard input is taken to be the name  of  an
       SCCS file to be processed.

       delta  may  issue prompts on the standard output depending
       on certain keyletters specified and flags (see that may be
       present in the SCCS file (see -m and -y keyletters below).

       Keyletter arguments  apply  independently  to  each  named
       file.   Uniquely  identifies  which delta is to be made to
       the SCCS file.  The use of  this  keyletter  is  necessary
       only  if two or more outstanding gets for editing (get -e)
       on the same SCCS file were done by the same person  (login
       name).   The SID value specified with the -r keyletter can
       be either the SID specified on the get command line or the
       SID to be made as reported by the get command (see A diag-
       nostic results if the specified SID is ambiguous,  or,  if
       necessary and omitted on the command line.  Suppresses the
       issue, on the standard output, of the created delta's SID,
       as  well  as  the  number  of  lines inserted, deleted and
       unchanged in the SCCS file.  Specifies  retention  of  the
       edited  g.file  (normally  removed  at completion of delta
       processing).  Specify a list (see for  the  definition  of
       list)  of  deltas  that are to be ignored when the file is
       accessed at the change level (SID) created by this  delta.
       If  the SCCS file has the v flag set (see then a Modifica-
       tion Request (MR) number must be supplied  as  the  reason
       for  creating  the  new  delta.  If -m is not used and the
       standard input is a terminal, the prompt MRs? is issued on
       the  standard output before the standard input is read; if
       the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.
       The  MRs? prompt always precedes the comments? prompt (see
       -y keyletter).  MRs in a  list  are  separated  by  blanks
       and/or  tab  characters.   An unescaped new-line character
       terminates the MR list.  Note that if the  v  flag  has  a
       value (see then a Modification Request (MR) number must be
       it is taken to be the name of a program (or  shell  proce-
       dure)  that  will  validate the correctness of the MR num-
       bers.  If a non-zero exit status is returned from  the  MR
       number  validation  program,  delta  terminates.   (It  is

       trary  text  used  to  describe  the reason for making the
       delta.  A null string is considered a valid  comment.   If
       -y  is not specified and the standard input is a terminal,
       the prompt comments?  is issued  on  the  standard  output
       before  the  standard input is read; if the standard input
       is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.  An unescaped new-
       line character terminates the comment text.  Supplementary
       code set characters may be used in comment.  Causes  delta

       A get of many SCCS files, followed by  a  delta  of  those
       files,  should  be  avoided when the get generates a large
       amount of data.   Instead,  multiple  get/delta  sequences
       should be used.

       If  the  standard input (-) is specified on the delta com-
       mand line, the -m (if necessary) and  -y  keyletters  must
       also  be  present.  Omission of these keyletters causes an
       error.

       Comments are limited to  text  strings  of  at  most  1024
       bytes.   Line  lengths greater than 1000 bytes cause unde-
       fined results.
