       what  searches  the given files for all occurrences of the
       pattern that the get command substitutes for %Z% (this  is
       @(#)  at  this printing) and prints out what follows until
       the first ", >, new-line, \, or NULL character.

       For example, if the C program in file f.c contains  #ident
       "@(#)identification  information"  and  f.c is compiled to
       yield f.o and a.out, then the command what f.c  f.o  a.out
       prints    f.c:         identification   information   f.o:
            identification information a.out:      identification
       information  what  is  intended  to be used in conjunction
       with the get command, which automatically inserts  identi-
       fying  information,  but  it  can  also  be used where the
       information is inserted manually.  Only one option exists:
       Quit after finding the first occurrence of pattern in each
       file.
