       fgrep  (fixed  string grep) searches files for a character
       string and prints all  lines  that  contain  that  string.
       fgrep is different from grep and egrep because it searches
       for a string instead  of  searching  for  a  pattern  that
       matches  an  expression.  It uses a fast and compact algo-
       rithm.

       fgrep processes supplementary code set characters  accord-
       ing  to  the  locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment
       variable (see LANG on except as noted under the -i  option
       below.   Pattern searches are performed on characters, not
       bytes.

       The characters $, *, [, ^, |, (, ), and \ are  interpreted
       literally by fgrep, that is, fgrep does not recognize full
       regular expressions as does egrep.  Because these  charac-
       ters  have  special  meaning to the shell, it is safest to
       enclose the entire string in single quotes (' . . . ').

       If no files are specified, fgrep assumes  standard  input.
       Normally,  each  line found is copied to the standard out-
       put.  The filename is printed before each  line  found  if
       there is more than one input file.

       Command  line  options are: Precede each line by the block
       number on which it was  found.   This  can  be  useful  in
       locating  block  numbers  by  context  (first block is 0).
       Print only a count of the lines that contain the  pattern.
       Suppress  printing  of  filenames  when searching multiple
       files.  Ignore uppercase/lowercase distinction during com-
       parisons;  valid for single-byte and multibyte characters.
       Print the names of files with matching lines  once,  sepa-
       rated  by  newlines.   Does  not repeat the names of files
       when the pattern is found more than once.   If  the  input
       file  is  stdin,  then  a message such as (standard input)
       will be written, depending upon the message locale.   Pre-
       cede  each line by its line number in the file (first line
       is 1).  Print all lines except those that contain the pat-
       tern.   Print  only  lines matched entirely.  Search for a
       special_string (string begins with a -).  Take the list of
       strings from file.

       Ideally  there  should be only one grep command, but there
       is not a single algorithm that spans a wide  enough  range
       of  space-time  tradeoffs.   Lines  are  limited to BUFSIZ
       bytes; longer lines are truncated.  BUFSIZ is  defined  in
       /usr/include/stdio.h.
