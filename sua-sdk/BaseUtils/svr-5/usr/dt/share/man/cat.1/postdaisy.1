       The  postdaisy  filter  translates  Diablo 630 daisy-wheel
       files into PostScript and writes the results on the  stan-
       dard output.  If no files are specified, or if - is one of
       the input files, the standard input is read.  The  follow-
       ing options are understood: Print num copies of each page.
       By default only one copy is printed.   Print  files  using
       font  name.  Any PostScript font can be used, although the
       best results will be  obtained  only  with  constant-width
       fonts.  The default font is Courier.  Set the initial hor-
       izontal motion index to  num.   Determines  the  character
       advance  and  the default point size, unless the -s option
       is used.  The default is 12.  Magnify each logical page by
       the factor num.  Pages are scaled uniformly about the ori-
       gin, which is located near the upper left corner  of  each
       page.   The default magnification is 1.0.  Print num logi-
       cal pages on each piece of paper, where  num  can  be  any
       positive  integer.   By  default,  num is set to 1.  Print
       pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated list.
       The  list contains single numbers N and ranges N1 - N2.  A
       missing N1 means the lowest numbered page,  a  missing  N2
       means  the  highest.   Print  files  in either portrait or
       landscape mode.  Only the first character of mode is  sig-
       nificant.  The default mode is portrait.  Selects carriage
       return and line feed behavior.  If num is 1, a  line  feed
       generates  a  carriage  return.   If  num is 2, a carriage
       return generates a line feed.  Setting num  to  3  enables
       both  modes.   Use  point  size num instead of the default
       value set by the initial horizontal motion index.  Set the
       initial  vertical  motion index to num.  The default is 8.
       Translate the origin num inches along the positive x axis.
       The  default  coordinate  system has the origin fixed near
       the upper left corner of the page, with positive x to  the
       right  and  positive  y down the page.  Positive num moves
       everything right.  The  default  offset  is  0.25  inches.
       Translate the origin num inches along the positive y axis.
       Positive num moves text up the page.  The  default  offset
       is -0.25 inches.
