       The  expand  command writes files or the standard input to
       the standard output with tab characters replaced with  one
       or  more  space  characters  needed to pad to the next tab
       stop.  Any backspace characters will be copied to the out-
       put  and cause the column position count for tab stop cal-
       culations to be decremented; the column position count  is
       not decremented below zero.

       The  unexpand  command  copies  files or standard input to
       standard output, converting blank characters at the begin-
       ning  of  each line into the maximum number of tab charac-
       ters followed by the minimum number  of  space  characters
       needed to fill the same column positions originally filled
       by the translated blank characters.  By default,  tabstops
       are  set  at every eighth column position.  Each backspace
       character is copied to the output, and causes  the  column
       position count for tab calculations to be decremented; the
       count will never be decremented to a value less than  one.

       The following options are supported: For unexpand only, in
       addition to translating blank characters at the  beginning
       of each line, translate all sequences of two or more blank
       characters immediately preceding a tab stop to the maximum
       number of tab characters followed by the minimum number of
       space characters needed to fill the same column  positions
       originally  filled  by  the  translated  blank characters.
       Specify the tab stops.  The argument tablist must  consist
       of  a single positive decimal integer or multiple positive
       decimal integers, separated by blank characters or commas,
       in  ascending  order.   If  a single number is given, tabs
       will be set tablist column positions apart instead of  the
       default  8.   If multiple numbers are given, the tabs will
       be set at those specific column positions.  Each  tab-stop
       position  must  be an integer value greater than zero, and
       the list must be in strictly  ascending  order.   This  is
       taken  to  mean  that, from the start of a line of output,
       tabbing to position N causes the next character output  to
       be in the (N+1)th column position on that line.

       In  the  event of expand having to process a tab character
       at a position beyond the last of those specified in a mul-
       tiple  tab-stop  list,  the tab character is replaced by a
       single space character in the output.  In the  obsolescent
       version,  the single number is specified as tabstop with a
       leading minus; multiple tab stops are  specified  after  a

                                                                1

expand(1)                                               expand(1)

       leading minus as tab1,tab2... and so forth.

       The  unexpand command makes no space-to-tab character con-
       versions for characters that occur at positions beyond the
       last of those specified in a multiple tab-stop list.

       For  unexpand,  when  -t  is  specified,  the  presence or
       absence of the -a option is ignored; conversion  will  not
       be  limited to the processing of leading blank characters.

       The following operands are supported: The  pathname  of  a
       text file to be used as input.

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of expand: Provide a default value for the  international-
       ization  variables  that  are  unset  or null.  If LANG is
       unset or null, the corresponding value from the  implemen-
       tation-specific  default  locale  will be used.  If any of
       the internationalization  variables  contains  an  invalid
       setting,  the  utility will behave as if none of the vari-
       ables had been defined.  If  set  to  a  non-empty  string
       value, override the values of all the other international-
       ization variables.  Determine the locale for the interpre-
       tation  of  sequences  of bytes of text data as characters
       (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte  characters
       in  arguments).   Determine the locale that should be used
       to affect the format and contents of  diagnostic  messages
       written to standard error.

       For expand, the standard output is equivalent to the input
       files with tab characters converted into  the  appropriate
       number of space characters.

       For  unexpand,  the  standard  output is equivalent to the
       input files with the specified space to tab character con-
       versions.

       An exit code of 0 indicates successful completion; an exit
       code greater than 0 indicates an error.

       The expand command terminates with an  error  message  and
       non-zero   exit   status  upon  encountering  difficulties
       accessing one of the file operands.

       One non-intuitive aspect of unexpand is its restriction to

                                                                2

       leading  spaces  when  neither  -a  nor  -t are specified.
       Users who desire to always convert all spaces  in  a  file
       can  easily  alias unexpand to use the -a or -t 8 options,
       as in the following: alias  unexpand="unexpand  -a"  alias
       unexpand="unexpand -t 8"
