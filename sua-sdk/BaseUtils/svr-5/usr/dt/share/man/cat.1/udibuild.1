       udibuild   builds   driver   modules  from  source  files.
       udibuild is typically run from a source file directory, or
       run by to build a source-distributed driver.  Invoked with
       no command-line options,  udibuild  searches  the  current
       directory  for  a udiprops.txt file and source files, then
       attempts to build a driver binary using  the  build  rules
       from  udiprops.txt.   The  resultant binary object modules
       are placed in the  bin/abi  subdirectory  of  the  current
       directory  (creating  subdirectories  as needed) where the
       name for the current applications binary  interface  (ABI)
       is substituted for abi.

       The following command-line options are understood: Specify
       a debug build.  Display the  help  message.   Display  the
       full  usage  information.  Do a dry run of udibuild.  Used
       with the -v option, commands are not  executed.   Commands
       are  echoed  only.   Specify an alternate output directory
       dir.  By default, udibuild places one relocatable file  in
       the  current  directory for each module declaration in the
       udiprops.txt file.  Specify an optimized build.  -O cannot
       be  used  with the -D option.  Specify an alternate static
       properties file.  Specify a temporary  directory  dir  for
       udibuild  to  use.   By  default,  this directory is /tmp.
       Build only objects whose source has changed.  Specify ver-
       bose output.  Display the help message.
