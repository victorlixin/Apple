       vtautofocus  is used to determine whether the focus of the
       display and keyboard is automatically transferred to a new
       virtual  terminal  when it is created. When vtautofocus is
       run with the -y option, the focus is transferred automati-
       cally  for  all  virtual terminals that are created subse-
       quently.  When vtautofocus is run with the option -n,  the
       focus  remains  unchanged  when a virtual terminal is cre-
       ated.

       When vtautofocus is called with the -y option, the in-core
       kd_no_activate variable is set to B_FALSE.  When vtautofo-
       cus is called with the -n option, the kd_no_activate vari-
       able is set to B_TRUE.

       To   set   default   behavior,   set   kd_no_activate   in
       /etc/conf/pack.d/kd/space.c  as  required.  The  file   is
       shipped with kd_no_activate set to B_TRUE.
