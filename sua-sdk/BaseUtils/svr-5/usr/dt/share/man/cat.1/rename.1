       rename renames a file.  old is the pathname of the file or
       directory to be renamed.  new is the new pathname  of  the
       file  or  directory.  Both old and new must be of the same
       type (either both files, or  both  directories)  and  must
       reside on the same file system.

       If  new already exists, it is removed.  Thus, if new names
       an existing directory, the directory  must  not  have  any
       entries  other  than,  possibly,  . and ...  When renaming
       directories, the new pathname must not name  a  descendant
       of  old.   The  implementation of rename ensures that upon
       successful completion a link named new will always  exist.

       If the final component of old is a symbolic link, the sym-
       bolic link is renamed, not the file or directory to  which
       it points.

       Write  permission  is required for both the directory con-
       taining old and the directory containing new.

       The system can deadlock if there is a  loop  in  the  file
       system  graph.   Such a loop takes the form of an entry in
       directory a, say a/foo, being a hard link to directory  b,
       and  an entry in directory b, say b/bar, being a hard link
       to directory a.  When such a loop exists and two  separate
       processes attempt to perform rename a/foo b/bar and rename
       b/bar  a/foo,  respectively,  the  system   may   deadlock
       attempting to lock both directories for modification.  The
       system administrator should replace hard links to directo-
       ries by symbolic links.
