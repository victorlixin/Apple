       The metasend program allows a user to  send  one  or  more
       pre-existing data files as non-text multimedia mail.

       With  no  arguments,  the  program  asks  the user for the
       ``To'', ``Subject'', and ``CC'' fields.  It then asks  for
       the  name  of  a MIME ``Content-type''.  Next, it asks the
       user for the name of an existing file containing that type
       of data; and it asks what encoding type, if any, should be
       applied to this data.  Finally, it asks  if  you  want  to
       include information from an additional file, in which case
       prompting is repeated for the next file.

       Alternately, all of this information can  be  provided  on
       the command line.

       The  following  command line options are supported: speci-
       fies the To address.  specifies the CC address.  specifies
       the  type  of  encoding.   Must  be either base64, quoted-
       printable, 7bit, or x-uue.  If 7bit, no encoding  is  per-
       formed.   specifies  the file containing the data.  speci-
       fies the MIME Content-type.  specifies the Subject  field.
       specifies the maximum size before splitting into parts via
       splitmail.  specifies batch or non-interactive mode.  Must
       be  used with -f, -m, -s, and -t, or the command will exit
       and return an error.  specifies that the  temporary  files
       should  be deleted even if delivery fails.  specifies that
       an additional file is included.

UUssaaggee
       Before each use of the -n option on the command line,  the
       options  -m,  -c,  and -f, at a minimum, must also be used
       and must appear separately for each included file.

       If more than one file is named,  the  parts  are  combined
       into a single multipart MIME object.

       The  mail  is  delivered  using splitmail, so if very long
       will arrive as  several  pieces,  which  is  automatically
       reassembled  by metamail.  The definition of very long can
       be altered using the -S flag or the SPLITSIZE  environment
       variable.

       Do not depend on metasend to do a good job of choosing the
       type of encoding if you do not specify one.

       The  metasend  command  is  intended  primarily  for  mail

                                                                1

       hackers.   A friendlier interface to non-text mail is pro-
       vided by mailto.

       MIME syntax checking on user-supplied Content-type  fields
       is not done, and users are all too likely to provide bogus
       MIME Content-type values.  In particular, various  charac-
       ters are not allowed when parameters are passed unless the
       parameters are enclosed in double quotes, but this sort of
       restriction is hard to enforce in a shell script.
