       stty sets certain terminal I/O options for the device that
       is the  current  standard  input;  without  arguments,  it
       reports the settings of certain options.

       In  the  input  and output of stty, if a character is pre-
       ceded by a caret (^), then the value of that option is the
       corresponding control character (for example, ``^h'' is H;
       in  this  case,  recall  that  H  is  the  same   as   the
       ``backspace''  key.)   The  sequence  ``^''' means that an
       option has a null value.

       The -- argument is used to indicate the  end  of  options.
       Any  arguments  following  the -- are treated as operands,
       even if they begin with a -. The -- should not be used  as
       an  option nor as an operand.  Report all option settings.
       Report current settings in a form that can be used  as  an
       argument to another stty command.

       For  detailed  information  about the modes listed in sec-
       tions through See For detailed information about the modes
       listed in sections and See Options described in the ``Com-
       bination Modes'' section are implemented using options  in
       the  earlier  sections.   Note  that  many combinations of
       options make no sense, but  no  sanity  checking  is  per-
       formed.  Hardware flow control and clock modes options may
       not be supported by all hardware interfaces.  The  options
       are selected from the following:

       Enable  (disable) parity generation and detection.  Enable
       (disable) extended parity  generation  and  detection  for

       rate to the number given, if possible.   (All  speeds  are
       not  supported  by all hardware interfaces.)  Set terminal
       input baud rate to the number given,  if  possible.   (Not
       all  hardware  supports  split  baud rates.)  If the input
       baud rate is set to zero, the  input  baud  rate  will  be
       specified  by the value of the output baud rate.  Set ter-
       minal output baud rate to the number given,  if  possible.
       (Not all hardware supports split baud rates.)  If the out-
