       pkgparam  displays the value associated with the parameter
       or parameters requested on the command line.   The  values
       are  located  in  one  of the following places: (a) in the
       pkginfo file for pkginst, (b) on the device named with the
       -d  option,  or (c) on the specific file named with the -f
       option.  When a device is given, but a pkginst is not  (as
       shown  in  the second synopsis), parameter information for
       all packages residing on device is shown.

       One parameter value is shown per line.  Only the value  of
       a  parameter  is given unless the -v option is used.  With
       this option, the output of the command is in this  format:
       parameter1='value1'       parameter2='value2'      parame-
       ter3='value3'

       If no parameters are specified on the command line, values
       for  all parameters associated with the package are shown.

       Options and arguments for this command are: Specifies ver-
       bose  mode.   Displays  name  of  parameter and its value.
       Specifies the device on which pkginst is  stored.   device
       can  be  (a)  the  full  pathname  to a directory (such as
       /var/tmp), (b) the full pathname  to  a  device  (such  as
       /dev/rmt/*  or /dev/dsk/*) [see and (c) a device alias; or
       (d) "-" which specifies packages in datastream format read
       from  standard input.  The default device is the installa-
       tion spool directory (/var/spool/pkg).

       An alias is the unique name by which a  device  is  known.
       (For  example,  the alias for a cartridge tape drive might
       be ctape1.)  The name must be  limited  in  length  to  64
       characters  (DDB_MAXALIAS)  and  can contain only alphanu-
       meric characters and/or any of the following special char-
       acters:  underscore  (_), dollar sign ($), hyphen (-), and
       period (.).  No two devices in the database can share  the
       same  alias.   Requests  that  the  command  read file for
       parameter values.  Defines a specific  package  for  which
       parameter   values   should   be  displayed.   The  format
       pkginst.* can be used to indicate all instances of a pack-
       age.   When using this format, enclose the command line in
       single quotes to prevent the shell from interpreting the *
       character.   Defines  a  specific  parameter  whose  value
       should be displayed.

       If  parameter  information  is not available for the indi-
       cated package, the command exits with a  non-zero  status.
       Successful  completion  of script.  Fatal error. Installa-

       The -f synopsis allows you to specify the file from  which
       parameter values should be extracted.  This file should be
       in the same format as a pkginfo file.  As an example, such
       a  file  might  be  created during package development and
       used while testing software during this stage.

                                                                2
