       The more command reads files and either writes them to the
       terminal  on a page-by-page basis or filters them to stan-
       dard output.

       The more command normally pauses after each screenful.  If
       more  is  reading from a file rather than a pipe, the per-
       centage of characters displayed so far is also shown.

       more scrolls up to display one more line in response to  a
       character;  it displays another screenful in response to a
        character.  Other commands are listed below.

       page clears the screen before displaying the next  screen-
       ful  of  text; it only provides a one-line overlap between
       screens.

       more sets the terminal to noecho mode, so that the  output
       can be continuous.  Commands that you type do not normally
       show up on your terminal, except for the / and ! commands.

       If  the  standard output is not a terminal, more acts just
       like

       The following options are available with more: Do not show
       line  numbers.   Clear  before  displaying.  Redrawing the
       screen instead of scrolling  for  faster  displays.   This
       option  is ignored if the terminal does not have the abil-
       ity to clear to the end of a line.  Display error messages
       rather  than  ringing the terminal bell if an unrecognized
       command is used.  This is helpful for inexperienced users.
       Exit  immediately  after writing the last line of the last
       file in the standard input.  Perform pattern  matching  in
       searches  without regard to case.  Specify number of lines
       in terminal window.  For each file in the standard  input,
       execute  the indicated more command upon opening the file.
       If the command is a positioning command,  the  command  is
       evaluated  and the current position displayed reflects the
       results of the command.  If  command  fails,  the  current
       position  is  set  to the first line in the file.  Same as
       the -p command option.  Squeeze.  Replace  multiple  blank
       lines  with  a  single  blank  line.  This is helpful when
       viewing output, on the screen.  Write the screenful of the

       Suppress generation of underlining escape sequences.  Nor-
       mally,  more handles underlining, such as that produced by
       in a manner appropriate to the terminal.  If the  terminal
       can perform underlining or has a stand-out mode, more sup-
       plies appropriate escape sequences as called  for  in  the
       text  file.   Do  not  show  control  characters as ^char.

       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of more: Specifies the screen size used by more for cursor
       positioning commands and scrolling.   Specifies  the  path
       name  of  the  editor  used  by  the v command.  Provide a
       default value for the internationalization variables  that
       are  unset  or null.  If LANG is unset or null, the corre-
       sponding value from  the  implementation-specific  default
       locale  will  be used.  If any of the internationalization
       variables contains an invalid setting,  the  utility  will
       behave  as  if none of the variables had been defined.  If
       set to a non-empty string value, override  the  values  of
       all  the  other internationalization variables.  Determine
       the locale for  the  behavior  of  range  expressions  and
       equivalence  classes.  Determine the locale for the inter-
       pretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
       (for  example,  single-  versus  multi-byte  characters in
       arguments) and the behavior of character classes.   Deter-
       mine  the  locale that should be used to affect the format
       and contents of diagnostic messages  written  to  standard
       error.   Specifies  the  vertical screen size used by more
       for cursor positioning commands and scrolling,  in  number
       of  lines  per  screenful, Specifies options to more;  any
       options specified in this environment  variable  get  exe-
       cuted   as   if   the   command   line  were:  more  $MORE
       other_options file That is, they get executed  before  any
       other  options  explicitly  specified on the command line.
       Options specified in the MORE variable must be preceded by
       hyphens  and  with blank spaces preceding option-arguments
       where necessary, just as you would on  the  command  line.
       Options  specified  in  the  MORE variable take precedence
       over the contents of the TERM and LINES environment  vari-
       ables.  Specifies the name of the terminal type; more uses
       the terminal's entry to determine its display characteris-
       tics.

       The commands take effect immediately;  it is not necessary
       to type a carriage return.  Up to the time when  the  com-
       mand character itself is given, the user may type the line
       kill character to  cancel  the  numerical  argument  being
       formed.

       In  the  following  commands,  i  is an optional numerical
       argument (1 by default).  Display another screenful, or  i
       more  lines if i is specified.  Display another line, or i
       more lines, if specified.  Display another line, or i more
       lines, if specified.  Display (scroll down) half a screen-
       ful.  If i is given, the scroll size is set to i.  Same as
       D.   Same  as , except that i, if present, becomes the new
       default number of lines per screenful.  Skip i  lines  and
       then  print a screenful.  Skip back i lines and then print
       a screenful, with a default of half the screen size.  Same
       as  U.   Skip  i  lines  and  then print a screenful.  The
       default is one screen.  Same as  if.   Scroll  backward  i
       lines.   The  default  is one line.  Skip back i lines and
       then print a screenful.  The default is one screen.   Same
       as B.  Go to the ith line in the file, with a default of 1
       (the beginning of the file).  Go to the ith  line  in  the
       file,  with a default of the last line in the file.  If no
       count is specified, the screen is  cleared  and  the  last
       screenful  of  the file is displayed with the last line of
       the file at the bottom of the screen.  Refresh the screen.
       Refresh the screen, discarding any buffered input.  If the
       current file is non-seekable, this is equivalent to the  r
       command.  Mark the current position with the supplied let-
       ter.  Marks are usually lost when  you  switch  to  a  new
       file.   Return  to  the  mark associated with the supplied
       letter, previously used with the m command, and make  that
       line  the current position.  Return to the line associated
       with the last movement command which changed  the  current
       cursor  position  by  more  than  a screenful.  If no such
       movements have been made, return to the first line of  the
       file.   Display  the  current  line  number, and filename.
       Drop into the editor indicated by the  EDITOR  environment
       variable,  at  the  current line of the current file.  The
       default editor is Help.  Give a  description  of  all  the
       more  commands.   Search forward for the ith occurrence of
       the regular expression  pattern.   Display  the  screenful
       starting  at  the line that contains the ith match for the
       regular  expression  pattern,  or  the  end  of  a   pipe,
       whichever  comes  first.  If more is displaying a file and
       there is no such match, its position in the  file  remains
       unchanged.   Regular expressions can be edited using erase
       and kill characters.  Erasing back past the  first  column
       cancels  the search command.  Search forward; same as last
       command described above, except that the exclamation char-
       acter  (!)  indicates that the ith line that does not con-
       tain the given pattern becomes the  current  cursor  posi-
       tion.  Search backward; same as the last command described
       above.  Repeat the previous search for the ith  occurrence
       of  the  last  pattern  entered.   Search  in the opposite
       direction of the previously performed search for  the  ith
       occurrence of the last pattern entered.  Invoke a shell to
       execute command.  The characters % and !, when used within
       command  are  replaced  with  the current filename and the
       previous shell command,  respectively.   If  there  is  no

       current  filename, % is not expanded.  Prepend a backslash
       to these characters to escape expansion.  Display the list
       of files.  Skip to the ith next filename given in the com-
       mand line, or to the last filename in the list if i is out
       of  range.  Skip to the ith previous filename given in the
       command line, or to the first filename  if  i  is  out  of
       range.   If  given while more is positioned within a file,
       go to the beginning of the file.  If more is reading  from
       a  pipe, more simply rings the terminal bell.  Position at
       i percent into the file.  Display the current filename and
       line number.  Go to the supplied tag and scroll or rewrite
       the current screen with that line as the current position.
