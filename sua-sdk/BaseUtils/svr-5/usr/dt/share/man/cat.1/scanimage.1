       scanimage  1  is a command-line interface to control image
       acquisition devices such as flatbed scanners  or  cameras.
       The  device  is controlled via command-line options. After
       command-line processing, scanimage  normally  proceeds  to
       acquire  an  image.  The image data is written to standard
       output in one of the PNM (portable  aNyMaP)  formats  (PBM
       for  black and white images, PGM for grayscale images, and
       PPM for color images). scanimage accesses  image  acquisi-
       tion  devices  through  the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       interface and can  support  any  device  for  which  there
       exists a SANE backend.

       must  be followed by a SANE device-name.  A (partial) list
       of available devices can  be  obtained  with  the  --list-
       devices option. If no device-name is specified explicitly,
       scanimage will attempt to open the first available device.
       requests  help  information. The information is printed on
       standard output and in this case, no attempt will be  made
       to acquire an image.  requests a (partial) list of devices
       that are available. The list is not  complete  since  some
       devices may be available, but are not listed in any of the
       configuration files (which are typically stored in  direc-
       tory /usr/local/etc/sane.d). This is particularly the case
       when accessing scanners through the network. If  a  device
       is  not  listed  in  a configuration file, the only way to
       access it is by its full device name.  requests that scan-
       image  perform  a few simple sanity tests to make sure the
       backend works as defined by the SANE  API  (in  particular
       the   sane_read  function  is  exercised  by  this  test).
       increases the verbosity of  the  operation  of  scanimage.
       The option may be specified repeatedly, each time increas-
       ing the verbosity level.

       Much of the power of scanimage comes from the fact that it
       can  control any SANE backend. Thus, the exact set of com-
       mand-line options  depends  on  the  capabilities  of  the
       selected  device.  To  see  the options for a device named
       dev, invoke scanimage using:  scanimage  --help  --device-
       name dev

       The  documentation for the device-specific options printed
       by --help is best explained with a few examples:  Controls
       the brightness of the acquired image.

       The  option  --brightness  expects  an option value in the
       range from -100 to 100 percent. The value in square brack-
       ets  indicates that the current option value is 0 percent.

                                                                1

       Set default values for enhancement controls.

       The option --default-enhancements has no option value.  It
       should  be thought of as having an immediate effect at the
       point of the command line at which it appears.  For  exam-
       ple, since this option resets the --brightness option, the
       option-pair --brightness 50  --default-enhancements  would
       have  no  effect and the options would be set to defaults.
       Selects the scan mode (Line Art, gray or color).

       The option --mode accepts an argument that must be one  of
       the strings ``Lineart'', ``Gray'', or ``Color''. The value
       in the square bracket indicates that the  option  is  cur-
       rently  set  to  ``Gray''. For convenience, it is legal to
       abbreviate the  string  values  as  long  as  they  remain
       unique.  It  is case-insensitive. For example, option set-
       ting --mode col is identical to --mode Color.   Determines
       whether a built-in or a custom gamma-table should be used.

       The option --custom-gamma expects either a  ``no''  option
       value,  or  a  ``yes'' option value.  The value in square-
       brackets  indicates  that  the  option  is  not  currently
       active.  Attempting  to  set the option would result in an
       error message.  The set  of  available  options  typically
       depends on the settings of other options. For example, the
       --custom-gamma table might be active only when a grayscale
       or color scan mode has been requested.

       Note  that  the  --help option is processed only after all
       other options have been processed.  This makes it possible
       to see the option settings for a particular mode by speci-
       fying the appropriate mode-options along with  the  --help
       option.   For  example, the command line: scanimage --help
       --mode color would print the option settings that  are  in
       effect  when the color-mode is selected.  Gamma-correction
       table. In color mode this option equally affects the  red,
       green,  and  blue channels simultaneously (it is an inten-
       sity gamma table).

       The option --gamma-table expects zero or  more  values  in
       the  range  0  to 255. For example, a legal value for this
       option would be ``3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12''.  Since  it  is
       cumbersome  to specify long vectors in this form, the same
       can  be expressed by the abbreviated form  ``[0]3-[9]12''.
       This  means that the first vector element is set to 0, the
       9-th element is set to 12 and the values  in  between  are
       interpolated  linearly. It is possible to specify multiple
       such       linear       segments.       For       example,
       ``[0]3-[2]3-[6]7,[7]10-[9]6''     is     equivalent     to
       ``3,3,3,4,5,6,7,10,8,6''.  The filename of the image to be
       loaded.

       The  option takes an arbitrary string value (which happens
       to be a filename). The value in brackets  shows  that  the

                                                                2
