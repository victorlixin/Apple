       The tsad program is a daemon process that makes up part of
       the Storage Management Services (SMS) Target Service Agent
       (TSA) for &gemini;. Its job is to notify a set of  NetWare
       servers  that a &gemini; machine is available to be backed
       up and wait  for  a  backup  request  from  one  of  those
       servers.  When a request for backup arrives from a NetWare
       server, the program is spawned to interact with the opera-
       tor  on  the NetWare server and to transmit the data to be
       backed up.

       If one of the notified NetWare servers is reset,  it  will
       no  longer  be  aware  of  the &gemini; machine. tsad will
       therefore  wake  up  every  register_timeout  seconds  and
       notify each NetWare server again.

       The  NetWare servers to be notified, along with the proto-
       col to be used to notify each server, is  read  from  con-
       fig_file. See for details on the format of this file. If a
       NIS map named unixtsa is found in the currently bound  NIS
       domain,  then  this  map  will  similarly  be  scanned for
       servers.

       Error    messages,    if    any,    are     written     to
       /var/adm/unixtsa.log.

       The  following options are supported: Specify the configu-
       ration file to be  used.  Defaults  to  /etc/unixtsa.conf.
       Specify a registration timeout value in seconds. When this
       time limit expires, the daemon will  again  register  with
       each  NetWare  server that it knows about. Defaults to one
       hour (3600).  Specify a connection timeout value  in  sec-
       onds.  When  communicating  with  a NetWare server for any
       reason,  the  daemon  will  wait  this  many  seconds  for
       replies. This value may need to be increased for slow net-
       works, keeping in mind that a server request to perform  a
       backup cannot be serviced while the daemon is already try-
       ing to contact another server. Defaults to thirty  seconds
       (30).   Specify  the  full path to the tsaunix executable.
       Defaults to /opt/bin/tsaunix.

       Language-specific message file (see  LANG  on  the  manual
       page).   Default  configuration  file  that  lists NetWare
       servers with which to register the  protocol  to  use  for
       each  server.  This information will also be read from the
       NIS map unixtsa if it exists.

                                                                1
