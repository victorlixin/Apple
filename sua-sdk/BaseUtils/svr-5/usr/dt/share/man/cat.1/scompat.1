       COFF-  or  ELF-based  applications  developed for   System
       V/386 3.2 (or later releases) that use  graphics  may  not
       work  correctly on the system VGA/EGA/CGA console or Fiber
       Optic Workstations, which are STREAMS-based beginning with
       System V/386 Release 4.

       The scompat command sets up the workstation environment so
       that these applications can function correctly.  While the
       environment  is  in effect, access to the workstation as a
       STREAMS device will  not  work  correctly  unless  the  -r
       option is used with the argument 4 (see below).

       The options and arguments for this command are: interpret-
       number, where interpretnumber is:
        System V/386 Release  3.2  ioctl  interpretation  STREAMS
       ioctl  interpretation for COFF executables a shell command
       line (for example, scompat ls -l).  The command line  will
       be  executed with the compatibility environment in effect.
       When the command completes  execution,  the  compatibility
       environment is restored to its previous state.

       For  computers  based  on Intel(R) microprocessors, if the
       shell environment variable SCOMPAT is set to 3.2, uname -a
       gives a value of 3.2 for release and a value of 2 for ver-
       sion.

       To set SCOMPAT to any other version, use the syntax  SCOM-
       PAT=release:version

       To return to the beginning state, unset SCOMPAT.

       In  all  cases,  when  SCOMPAT is set, it must be exported
