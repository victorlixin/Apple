       comm reads file1 and file2, which should be ordered in the
       current locale's collating sequence (see  and  produces  a
       three-column  output:  lines  only in file1; lines only in
       file2; and lines in both files.  The file name - means the
       standard input.

       Flags  1,  2,  or 3 suppress printing of the corresponding
       column.  Thus comm -12 prints only the lines common to the
       two  files;  comm  -23 prints only lines in the first file
       but not in the second; comm -123 prints nothing.

       The lines are compared using the current  locale's  colla-
       tion sequence, set by the environment variable LC_COLLATE.
       (See LANG in for the  locale  environment  variables,  and
       their  effects  on collation.) Note that if the files were
       sorted with  a  different  collation  sequence  from  each
       other,  or  from  that  under  which comm is executed, the
       results will be meaningless.

       The LC_CTYPE environment variable determines the  codesets
       used  in  the  command line arguments and the files.  (See
       LANG on Note that if this variable differs when the  files
       are  sorted,  or when comm is executed, the output of comm
       will be meaningless.  Note  also,  that  if  LC_CTYPE  and
       LC_COLLATE are set to different values, meaningful results
       cannot be guaranteed.
