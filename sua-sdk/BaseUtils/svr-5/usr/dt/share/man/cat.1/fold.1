       Fold  the contents of the specified files, or the standard
       input if no files are specified,  breaking  the  lines  to
       have maximum width of width screen columns (or bytes if -b
       is specified). A line shall not be broken in the middle of
       a character (as specified by the locale given in LC_CTYPE,
       see LANG on

       If a backspace character occurs in the  input,  the  width
       count  will be decremented by one (but will never go below
       zero). If a tab character occurs, the width count  is  set
       to  the next tab stop. The next tab stop is the next value
       of width that is a multiple of eight (counting  the  first
       column as column 0).

       Count  width  in  bytes.  If this option is not specified,
       width is counted in column positions.  If a segment  of  a
       line  contains a blank within the first width column posi-
       tions (or bytes), break the line after the last such blank
       meeting  the width constraints. If there is no such blank,
       -s will have no effect for  that  output  segment  of  the
       input  line.  (A  blank is defined by the current locale's
       LC_CTYPE, see LANG on Specify the maximum width in  screen
       columns  (or  bytes, if -b is specified).  The default for
       width is 80.  width should be a multiple of 8 if tabs  are
       present, or the tabs should be expanded.

       Folding  may  not  work  correctly if underlining or over-
       striking is present.

       The -width option is provided for backward  compatibility,
       it  will  be  removed  in  a  future release. The -w width
       option should be used.
