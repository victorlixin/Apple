       The strings command looks for ASCII strings  in  a  binary
       file.   A  string  is  any  sequence of 4 or more printing
       characters ending with a newline or a null character.

       strings is useful for identifying random object files  and
       many other things.

       The  following  options  are available: Look everywhere in
       the file for strings.  If this flag  is  omitted,  strings
       only  looks in the initialized data space of object files.
       Precede each string by its offset in the file.  Use number
       as  the minimum string length rather than 4.  Precede each
       string by its byte offset from the start of the file.  The
       byte  offset  is  displayed in the format specified by the
       single-character format argument: d  for  decimal,  o  for
       octal, and x for hexadecimal.  Options may be delimited by
       -- where appropriate to avoid ambiguity.

       On successful completion strings returns 0.   Otherwise  a
       value of >0 is returned.

       The  algorithm for identifying strings is extremely primi-
       tive.

       For backwards compatibility, -number can be used in  place
       of -n number.  Similarly, the -a and a - option are inter-
       changeable.  The - and the -number variations are obsoles-
       cent and may be removed in a future release.
