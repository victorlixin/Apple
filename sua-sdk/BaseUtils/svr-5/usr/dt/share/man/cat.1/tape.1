       tape  sends  commands to and receives status from the tape
       subsystem.  tape can communicate with  QIC-24/QIC-02  car-
       tridge tape drives and SCSI tape drives.

       tape  reads  /etc/default/tape  to find the default device
       name for sending commands and receiving status.  For exam-
       ple,  the  following  line in /etc/default/tape will cause
       tape to communicate with the first cartridge tape  device:
       device = /dev/rmt/ctape1

       If  device  is specified on the command line, it overrides
       the default device.

       tape takes the following flag: Specify the  type  of  tape
       drive, where type can be c for non-SCSI devices, and s for
       SCSI devices.  This option is maintained for backward com-
       patibility with
        systems  only.   On  UnixWare systems, both SCSI and non-
       SCSI tape drives are handled in a  common  manner  by  the
       same  target  driver  (st01),  thus specifying type has no
       effect.

       The value of command may be one of the following:

       Erase and retension the tape cartridge.  Reset  tape  con-
       troller  and tape drive.  This command clears error condi-
       tions  and  returns  tape  subsystem  to  power-up  state.
       Retension  tape  cartridge.   This  command should be used
       periodically to remedy slack tape  problems.   Tape  slack
       can  cause  an  unusually  large  number  of  tape errors.
       Rewind to beginning of tape.  Wind  tape  forward  to  the
       next file mark.

       The  reset command can be used while the tape is busy with
       other operations.  All other commands wait until the  cur-
       rently  executing  command  has been completed before pro-
       ceeding.

       When you are using the non-rewinding tape  device  or  the
       tape  command  rfm,  the tape drive light remains on after
       the command has been completed, indicating that more oper-
       ations may be performed on the tape.  The tape rewind com-
       mand may be used to clear this condition.
