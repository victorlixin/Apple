       xsane provides a graphical user interface  to  control  an
       image  acquisition  device  such as a flatbed scanner or a
       camera. It allows previewing, copying, faxing and scanning
       individual  images and can be invoked either directly from
       the command-line or through the  GIMP  image  manipulation
       program.  In  the former case, xsane acts as a stand-alone
       program that saves acquired images in a suitable PNM  for-
       mat  (PBM  for  black  and white images, PGM for grayscale
       images, and PPM for color images) or converts the image to
       JPEG, PNG, PS or TIFF.  In the latter case, the images are
       directly passed to the GIMP for further processing.

       xsane accesses image acquisition devices through the  SANE
       (Scanner Access Now Easy) interface. The list of available
       devices depends on installed hardware  and  configuration.
       When  invoked  without  an  explicit  devicename argument,
       xsane presents a dialog listing all  known  and  available
       devices.   To access an available device that is not known
       to the system, the devicename must  be  specified  explic-
       itly.

       See  the xsane online help for explanations of the options
       available.

       To start xsane as a GIMP plugin, you have to  set  a  sym-
       bolic  link  from  the  xsane  binary to the GIMP plug-ins
       directory.   For  example,  if   xsane   is   located   in
       /usr/local/bin  and  you  use  gimp-1.0.x,  enter:  ln  -s
       /usr/local/bin/xsane   ~/.gimp/plug-ins/   if   you    use
       gimp-1.1.x,     enter:    ln    -s    /usr/local/bin/xsane
       ~/.gimp-1.1/plug-ins/ After creating this  symbolic  link,
       xsane will be queried by gimp the next time it is invoked.
       From then on, you can start xsane from the GIMP via

       contains short-cuts to the SANE devices that  were  avail-
       able at the time xsane was queried.

       The GIMP caches these short-cuts in ~/.gimp/pluginrc. When
       the list of available devices changes (for example, a  new
       scanner  is  installed  or  the  device of the scanner has
       changed), you need to  rebuild  the  cache.  To  do  this,
       either  the  xsane  binary: touch  /usr/local/bin/xsane or
       delete the plugin cache: rm ~/.gimp/pluginrc  Either  way,
       invoking  the  GIMP  afterwards  will cause pluginrc to be
       rebuilt.

       Shared memory images usually enhance performance but cause
       problems  with  some  X11  servers. Unless your X11 server
       dies when running this program, there is no need or advan-
       tage  to  specify  this flag.  requests the display of X11
       events.  This  is  for  debugging  only.  --no-show-events
       turns  off  the  display  of  X11 events.  requests a syn-
       chronous connection with  the  X11  server.  This  is  for
       debugging purposes only.

       If  xsane  is started as a GIMP plugin it always sends the
       scanned image to the GIMP.

       Copy or fax mode can not be selected when  xsane  runs  as
       GIMP plugin.

       This  files  holds the user preferences.  This file should
       not be manipulated directly.   You  should  customize  the
       program through the dialog.  For each device, there is one
       rc file that holds the saved settings for that  particular
       device.  This file should not be manipulated directly. You
       should use the xsane interface to select appropriate  val-
       ues  and  then  save  the  device settings using the menu.
       After acquiring a preview, xsane normally saves  the  pre-
       view image in this device-specific file. The next time the
       program is started up, the program  can  present  the  old
       preview image.  This feature can be turned off through the
       dialog.  This system-wide file controls the aspects of the
       user-interface such as colors and fonts. It is a GTK style
       file and provides fine control over the visual aspects  of
       the  user-interface.  This file serves the same purpose as
       the system-wide style file. If present,it takes precedence
       over the system wide style file.
