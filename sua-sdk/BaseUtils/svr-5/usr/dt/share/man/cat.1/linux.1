       If  the  &lkpou8;  is  installed, the linux command can be
       used to change from native  mode to &lx; mode.  The  linux
       command  changes  mode for the user executing the command.
       This is the recommended method of changing mode because it
       sets  up  the user's &lx; PATH and other environment vari-
       ables properly.  To exit &lx; mode and  return  to   mode,
       type -D or exit.

       If  you  are the root user, the linux command switches you
       into &lx; mode, but it does not change directory into  the
       /linux  directory  tree.  You must cd to the directory you
       want to be in.

       If the &lkp; is disabled because of  auditing,  the  linux
       command  will  fail with the following message: The system
       administrator has disabled Linux Kernel  Personality  sup-
       port for the purpose of auditing system activity.
