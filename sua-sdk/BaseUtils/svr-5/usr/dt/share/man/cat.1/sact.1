       sact  informs  the user of any impending deltas to a named
       SCCS file.  This situation occurs when  get  with  the  -e
       option  has  been previously executed without a subsequent
       execution of delta.  If a directory is named on  the  com-
       mand  line, sact behaves as though each file in the direc-
       tory were specified as a named file, except that  non-SCCS
       files  and  unreadable  files  are silently ignored.  If a
       name of - is given, the standard input is read  with  each
       line  being  taken  as the name of an SCCS file to be pro-
       cessed.

       The output for each named file  consists  of  five  fields
       separated  by  spaces.   specifies the SID of a delta that
       currently exists in the SCCS file to which changes will be
       made to make the new delta.  specifies the SID for the new
       delta to be created.  contains the logname of the user who
       will make the delta (that is, executed a get for editing).
       contains the date that get -e was executed.  contains  the
       time that get -e was executed.
