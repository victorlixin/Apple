       comb  generates  a  shell  procedure  [see that, when run,
       reconstructs the  given  SCCS  files.   The  reconstructed
       files  are typically smaller than the original files.  The
       arguments may be specified in any order, but all keyletter
       arguments  apply  to all named SCCS files.  If a directory
       is named, comb behaves as though each file in  the  direc-
       tory  were specified as a named file, except that non-SCCS
       files (last component of the path name does not begin with
       s.)  and unreadable files are silently ignored.  If a name
       of - is given, the standard input is read;  each  line  of
       the  input  is  taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be
       processed;  non-SCCS  files  and  unreadable   files   are
       silently  ignored.  The generated shell procedure is writ-
       ten on the standard output.

       The keyletter arguments are as follows.  Each argument  is
       explained  as  if  only one named file is to be processed,
       but the effects of any keyletter argument  apply  indepen-
       dently to each named file.  For each get -e, this argument
       causes the  reconstructed  file  to  be  accessed  at  the
       release  of  the delta to be created, otherwise the recon-
       structed file would be accessed at the most recent  ances-
       tor.  Use of the -o keyletter may decrease the size of the
       reconstructed SCCS file.  It may also alter the  shape  of
       the delta tree of the original file.  This argument causes
       comb to generate a shell procedure that,  when  run,  pro-
       duces  a  report  that gives for each file: the file name,
       size (in blocks) after combining, original size  (also  in
       blocks),  and percentage change computed by: 100 * (origi-
       nal - combined) / original

       It is recommended that before any SCCS files are  actually
       combined,  one should use this option to determine exactly
       how much space is saved by  the  combining  process.   The
       SCCS identification string (SID) of the oldest delta to be
       preserved.  All older deltas are discarded in  the  recon-
       structed  file.   A  list  of deltas to be preserved.  All
       other deltas are discarded.  See for the syntax of a list.

       If  no  keyletter  arguments are specified, comb preserves
       only leaf deltas  and  the  minimal  number  of  ancestors
       needed to preserve the tree.

       comb may rearrange the shape of the tree of deltas.

       comb may not save any space; in fact, it is  possible  for
       the reconstructed file to be larger than the original.
