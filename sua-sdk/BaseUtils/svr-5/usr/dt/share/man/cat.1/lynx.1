       Lynx  is  a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for
       users running cursor-addressable,  character-cell  display
       devices  (such as vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running
       on PC or Macintosh computers, or any other curses-oriented
       display).   Lynx displays hypertext markup language (HTML)
       documents containing links to files residing on the  local
       system,  as  well as files residing on remote systems run-
       ning Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP  servers.   Current
       versions of Lynx run on  and VMS.

       Lynx  can  be used to access information on the WWW, or to
       build information systems  intended  primarily  for  local
       access.   For example, Lynx has been used to build several
       Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In addition, Lynx
       can be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

       At startup, Lynx loads any local file or remote URL speci-
       fied on the command line.  For help with URLs, press ?  or
       h while running Lynx.  Then, follow the link  titled  Help
       on URLs.

       If  the  only argument is '-', Lynx expects to receive the
       arguments from standard in (stdin).  This  allow  for  the
       potentially  very long command line that can be associated
       with the or arguments.  Specifies the  anonymous  account.
       Specifies  the  charset  for documents that do not specify
       one.  Specifies the charset used for  local  files.   Uses
       this  charset  instead of unrecognized charsets.  Sets the
       authorization ID and password for protected  documents  at
       startup.   Be  sure  to  protect any script files that use
       this switch.  Prepends a request URL comment and BASE  tag
       to  text and HTML outputs for or dumps.  Uses the bookmark
       page as the start page.  The default or command-line start
       page is still set for the main screen command, and is used
       if the bookmark page is unavailable or  blank.   See  also
       Toggles  scanning news articles for buried references, and
       converts them to  news  links.   Not  recommended  because
       email  addresses  enclosed  in angle brackets will be con-
       verted to false news links, and uuencoded  messages  might
       be trashed.  Sets the NUMBER of documents cached in memory
       (default 10).  Enables  case-sensitive  string  searching.
       Specifies a Lynx configuration file other than the default
       lynx.cfg.  Exits on left arrow in start page, and  disable
       save-to-disk  feature.   Toggles  handling  of  Set-Cookie
       headers.  Used with outputs each page to a file; used with
       formats  output  as  with  -traversal, but to standard out
       (stdout).  Sets the DISPLAY variable for X  rexec-ed  pro-
       grams.  Dumps the formatted output of the default document
       or one specified on  the  command  line  to  stdout.   For

       Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along
       the way.  The earliest versions of Lynx included code from
       Earl  Fogel  of  Computing  Services  at the University of
       Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ  in  the   environ-
       ment.   HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of Think.com
       and served as the model for the early  versions  of  Lynx.
       Those   versions  also  incorporated  libraries  from  the
       Gopher clients developed at the University  of  Minnesota,
       and  the  later  versions  of  Lynx rely on the WWW client
       library code, developed by Tim  Berners-Lee  and  the  WWW
       community.   Also  a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
       ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or  organized  most  of
       its  development  since the departures of Lou Montulli and
       Garrett Blythe from the University of Kansas in the summer
       of  1994  through  the  current release of v2.7.1f, and to
       everyone on the net who has contributed to Lynx's develop-
       ment  either  directly  (through  patches, comments or bug
       reports) or indirectly (through inspiration  and  develop-
       ment of other systems).
