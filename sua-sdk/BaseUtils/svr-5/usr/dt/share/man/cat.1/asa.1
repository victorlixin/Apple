       The  asa  command  writes  the named files to the standard
       output mapping carriage-control characters from the  files
       to line printer control sequences as described below.

       The first character of every line will be removed from the
       input.  Additionally, if the  character  removed  is:  The
       rest of the line will be output without change.  A newline
       character will be output, followed  by  the  rest  of  the
       input  line.   A line feed is output, followed by the rest
       of the input line.  The newline character of the  previous
       line  is replaced with a carriage return, causing printing
       to return to column position 1, followed by  the  rest  of
       the  input  line.   If the + is the first character in the
       input, it will have the same effect as the  space  charac-
       ter.

       Any  character  other than those listed above that appears
       as the first character in a line is ignored.

       The file parameter is the path of an existing file.   More
       than one file may be specified.

       Input  files must be plain text files.  If no file parame-
       ter is specified, then asa interprets characters typed  to
       the standard input.

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of asa: Provide a default value for the  internationaliza-
       tion  variables  that are unset or null.  If LANG is unset
       or null, the corresponding value from the  implementation-
       specific  default  locale  will  be  used.   If any of the
       internationalization variables contains  an  invalid  set-
       ting,  the utility will behave as if none of the variables
       had been defined.  If set to  a  non-empty  string  value,
       override  the values of all the other internationalization
       variables.  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
       sequences  of  bytes of text data as characters (for exam-
       ple, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters in  argu-
       ments  and input files).  Determine the locale that should
       be used to affect the format and  contents  of  diagnostic
       messages written to standard error.

       The  standard output is the text from the input file modi-
       fied as described in the Description.

       An exit values of 0 indicates that all  input  files  were
       output  successfully.   A  value  greater than 0 indicates
       that an error occurred while processing the input.

       The following command: asa textfile permits the viewing of
       file  (created  by  a program using FORTRAN-style carriage
       control characters) on a terminal.

       The following command: a.out | asa | lp formats  the  FOR-
       TRAN  output  of  a.out  (presumably a previously compiled
       FORTRAN program) and directs it to the default printer.
