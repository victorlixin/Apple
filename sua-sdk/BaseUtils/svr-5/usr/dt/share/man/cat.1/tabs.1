       tabs  sets  the tab stops on the user's terminal according
       to the tab specification tabspec, after clearing any  pre-
       vious  settings.   The  user's terminal must have remotely
       settable hardware tabs.

       The tabspec argument can be any one  of:  canned  (-code),
       repetitive  (-n),  arbitrary  (n1,  n2,  .  . . ), or file
       (--file).  If no tabspec is given, the  default  value  is
       -8, that is,
        system ``standard'' tabs.  The lowest column number is 1.
       Note that for tabs, column 1 always refers to the leftmost
       column  on a terminal, even one whose column markers begin
       at 0, for example, the DASI 300, DASI 300s, and DASI  450.
       Use  one  of the codes listed below to select a canned set
       of tabs.  The valid codes and their meanings are  as  fol-

       code, the first typed character corresponds to card column
       7,  one space gets you to column 8, and a tab reaches col-
       umn 12.  Files using this tab setup should include a  for-
       mat  specification  as  follows  (see  <:t-c2  m6  s66 d:>
       1,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54,58,62,67
       COBOL compact format (columns 1-6 omitted), with more tabs
       than  -c2.  This is the recommended format for COBOL.  The
       appropriate format specification is [see <:t-c3 m6 s66 d:>

       SNOBOL 1,12,20,44
       UNIVAC  1100 Assembler A repetitive specification requests
       tabs at columns 1+n, 1+2*n, etc.  Of particular importance
       is the value 8: this represents the
        system  ``standard''  tab setting, and is the most likely
       tab setting to be found at a  terminal.   Another  special
       case  is  the value 0, implying no tabs at all.  The arbi-
       trary format permits the user to type any  chosen  set  of
       numbers,  separated  by commas, in ascending order.  Up to
       40 numbers are allowed.  If any number (except  the  first
       one)  is preceded by a plus sign, it is taken as an incre-
       ment to be added to the previous value.  Thus, the formats
       1,10,20,30, and 1,10,+10,+10 are considered identical.  If
       the name of a file is given, tabs reads the first line  of
       the  file, searching for a format specification [see If it
       finds one there, it sets the tab stops  according  to  it,
       otherwise  it sets them as -8.  This type of specification
       may be used to make sure that a  tabbed  file  is  printed

                                                                1

       with  correct  tab settings, and would be used with the pr
       command:      tabs -- file; pr file

       Any of the following also may be used;  if  a  given  flag
       occurs more than once, the last value given takes effect:

       tabs  usually  needs to know the type of terminal in order
       to set tabs and always needs to know the type to set  mar-
       gins.  type is a name listed in If no -T flag is supplied,
       tabs uses the value of the environment variable TERM.   If
       TERM  is  not defined in the environment [see tabs tries a
       sequence that will work for many terminals.  If the  envi-
       ronment  variable POSIX2 is set to any value and exported,
       then tabs displays a warning  message  when  the  terminal
       type  does  not support tab settings.  The margin argument
       may be used for some terminals.  It causes all tabs to  be
       moved over n columns by making column n+1 the left margin.
       If +m is given without a value of n, the value assumed  is
       10.   For  a  TermiNet,  the  first  value in the tab list
       should be 1, or the margin will move even further  to  the
       right.   The normal (leftmost) margin on most terminals is
       obtained by +m0.  The margin for most terminals  is  reset
       only when the +m flag is given explicitly.

       Tab  and margin setting is performed via the standard out-
       put.

       example using -code (canned specification) to set tabs  to
       the settings required by the assembler: columns 1, 10, 16,
       36, 72.  example of using -n  (repetitive  specification),
       where n is 8, causes tabs to be set every eighth position:
       1+(1*8), 1+(2*8), . . . , which evaluate to columns 9, 17,
       .  .  .  example of using n1,n2,...  (arbitrary specifica-
       tion) to set tabs at columns 1, 8,  and  36.   example  of
       using  --file  (file  specification) to indicate that tabs
       should  be  set   according   to   the   first   line   of
       $HOME/fspec.list/att4425 [see

tabs(1)                                                   tabs(1)

       tabs  clears  only  20 tabs (on terminals requiring a long
       sequence), but is willing to set 64.

       The tabspec used with the tabs command is  different  from
       the  one used with the newform command.  For example, tabs
       -8 sets every eighth position; whereas newform -i-8  indi-
       cates that tabs are set every eighth position.
