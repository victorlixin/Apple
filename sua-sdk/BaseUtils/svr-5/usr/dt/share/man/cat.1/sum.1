       sum  calculates and prints a 16-bit checksum for the named
       file, and also prints the number of 512 byte blocks in the
       file.   It  is typically used to look for bad spots, or to
       validate a file communicated over some transmission  line.
       The  option -r causes an alternate algorithm to be used in
       computing the checksum.
