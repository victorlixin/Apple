       The  dosslice  command  sets up the  device nodes to allow
       access to the partitions from the  system.   The  argument
       to  dosslice  is the hard disk drive that is being used, 0
       or 1.  If you omit the argument, the command  prompts  for
       the drive number.

       The   node   created  for  the   partition  may  be  read-
       able/writable by all.  You make this choice when  prompted
       whether to make the  partition public.  If the node is not
       made public, then you must enter the user  login  name  at
       the  next  prompt,  and  the  node is made private to that
       user.

       If multiple  partitions are found, each  one  is  given  a
       unique node name. The node name is printed for each parti-
       tion that is found.

       The dosslice command is needed  only  when   is  installed
       after has been installed.
