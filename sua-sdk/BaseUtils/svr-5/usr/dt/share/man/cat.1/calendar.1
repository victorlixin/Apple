       calendar  consults the file calendar in the current direc-
       tory and prints out lines that contain today's  or  tomor-
       row's  date  anywhere in the line.  Most reasonable month-
       day dates such as Aug. 24, august 24, 8/24, and so on, are
       recognized,  but  not  24  August  or  24/8.   On weekends
       ``tomorrow'' extends  through  Monday.   calendar  can  be
       invoked regularly by using the or commands.

       When  an  argument  is  present, calendar does its job for
       every user who has a file calendar in  his  or  her  login
       directory  and sends them any positive results by Normally
       this is done daily by facilities in the
        operating system (see

       If the environment variable DATEMSK is set, calendar  will
       use  its  value  as  the full path name of a template file
       containing format strings.  The strings consist  of  field
       descriptors  and text characters and are used to provide a
       richer set of allowable date  formats  in  different  lan-
       guages  by  appropriate  settings of the environment vari-
       ables LC_ALL, LC_TIME, and LANG (see The LC_CTYPE environ-
       ment variable is also examined for details of the codesets
       used in the format strings.  (See for the  allowable  list
       of field descriptors.)

       The  following  example  shows  the possible contents of a
       template: %B %eth of the year %Y

       %B represents the full month name, %e the day of month and
       %Y  the  year  (4 digits).  If DATEMSK is set to this tem-
       plate, the following calendar file would be  valid:  March
       7th of the year 1989 <Reminder>

       Your  calendar  must  be public information for you to get
       reminder service.

       calendar's extended idea of ``tomorrow'' does not  account
       for holidays.
