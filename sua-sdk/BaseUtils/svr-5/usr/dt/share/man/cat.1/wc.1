       wc  counts  the  number  of newline characters, words, and
       bytes in the named files, or in the standard input  if  no
       file  appears.   It also keeps a total count for all named
       files.

       A word is a non-zero-length string of characters delimited
       by  white  space.  White space is a sequence of characters
       designated as isspace in the current  locale,  as  set  by
       LC_CTYPE  (see LANG on In the C locale, white space is one
       of the following characters:  space,  newline,  horizontal
       tab, vertical tab, formfeed, carriage return.

       wc  processes  supplementary code set characters according
       to the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment  vari-
       able.   Supplementary  code  set characters are ignored as
       possible white space characters, and in word counts.

       The standard output for each file is the same as the  out-
       put of given this input: "%d %d %d %d %s\n" newlines words
       bytes characters file

       By default, wc acts as if all options were specified; that
       is,  it  reports  the  number  of lines, words, bytes, and
       characters in the file.  If any option is specified,  then
       only the count for that option is reported.  If no file is
       given, no file name is printed.  For the totals line,  the
       file is replaced with the locale's equivalent to ``total''
       (in the C locale, total is written).

       Report the number of newline characters  (lines).   Report
       the  number of words.  Report the number of bytes.  Report
       the number of characters.  If  none  of  the  options  are
       specified, the default is equivalent to -lwc.
