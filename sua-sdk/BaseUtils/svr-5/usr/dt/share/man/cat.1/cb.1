       The  cb  command  reads  syntactically  correct C programs
       either from its arguments or from the standard input,  and
       writes them on the standard output with spacing and inden-
       tation that display the  structure  of  the  C  code.   By
       default,  it  preserves  all user new-lines.  cb processes
       supplementary code set characters according to the  locale
       specified  in  the LC_CTYPE environment variable (see LANG
       on

       cb accepts the following options: Write the  code  in  the
       style  of Kernighan and Ritchie found in The C Programming
       Language.  Put split lines  back  together.   Split  lines
       that are longer than leng.  Print on standard error output
       the version of cb invoked.

NNoottiicceess
       cb treats asm as a keyword.

       The  format  of  structure initializations is unchanged by
       cb.

       Punctuation that is  hidden  in  preprocessing  directives
       causes indentation errors.
