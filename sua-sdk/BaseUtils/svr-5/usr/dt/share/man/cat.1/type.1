       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the shell.  See for  more  informa-
       tion on this shell.

       The  type  command  indicates  how  each argument would be
       interpreted if used as a command name.

       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of type: Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
       tion variables that are unset or null.  If LANG  is  unset
       or  null, the corresponding value from the implementation-
       specific default locale will  be  used.   If  any  of  the
       internationalization  variables  contains  an invalid set-
       ting, the utility will behave as if none of the  variables
       had  been  defined.   If  set to a non-empty string value,
       override the values of all the other  internationalization
       variables.  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
       sequences of bytes of text data as characters  (for  exam-
       ple,  single- as opposed to multi-byte characters in argu-
       ments).  Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
       affect  the  format  and  contents  of diagnostic messages
       written to standard error.  Used to determine the location
       of name.

       The  standard  output  of  type contains information about
       each operand.  The information provided typically  identi-
       fies  the  operand as a shell built-in, function, alias or
       keyword, and where applicable, may display  the  operand's
       pathname.

       An exit code of 0 indicates successful completion; an exit
       code greater than 0 indicates an error.

       If type is called in a separate command execution environ-
       ment, such as one of the following: nohup type writer find
       . -type f | xargs  type  it  might  not  produce  accurate
       results.
