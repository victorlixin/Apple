       tee  transcribes the standard input to the standard output
       and makes copies in the files.  The sole purpose of tee is
       to  serve, as its name implies, as a ``T'' in a pipe.  For
       example, the command grep pattern file1 | tee file2  |  wc
       -l

       catches  the  output  of  grep  in file2 without having to
       reexecute the command.

       The available options are: Ignore interrupts.  Append out-
       put to the files rather than overwriting them.
