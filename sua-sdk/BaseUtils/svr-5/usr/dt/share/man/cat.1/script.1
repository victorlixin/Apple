       script  makes  a  typescript of everything printed on your
       terminal, including prompts.  The typescript is written to
       file,  or  appended to file if the -a option is given.  If
       no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
       typescript.

       The  script ends when the forked shell exits or when -d is
       typed.
