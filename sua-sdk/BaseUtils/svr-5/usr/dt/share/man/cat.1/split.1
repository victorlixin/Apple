       split  reads  file and writes it in n-line pieces (default
       1000 lines) onto a set of output files.  The name  of  the
       first output file is name with aa appended, and so on lex-
       icographically, up to zz (a maximum of  676  files).   The
       maximum length of name is 2 characters less than the maxi-
       mum filename length allowed by the file system.  See If no
       output name is given, x is default.

       If  no input file is given, or if - is given in its stead,
       then the standard input file is used.

       The following options are recognized: Specify  the  number
       of  lines  in  each  resulting  file piece. The line_count
       argument is an unsigned decimal integer.  The  default  is
       1000.  If the input does not end with a newline character,
       the partial line will be included in the last output line.
       Use  suf_length  letters to form the suffix portion of the
       filenames of the split file.  If -a is not specified,  the
       default  suffix  length  is  two.  If  the sum of the name
       operand and the suf_length option-argument would create  a
       filename exceeding [NAME_MAX] bytes, an error will result;
       split will exit with a diagnostic  message  and  no  files
       will  be  created.   Split  a  file into pieces n bytes in
       size.  Split a file into  pieces  n*1024  bytes  in  size.
       Split a file into pieces n*1 048 576 bytes in size.
