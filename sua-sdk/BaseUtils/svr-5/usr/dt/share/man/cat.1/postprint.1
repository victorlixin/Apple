       The postprint filter translates text files into PostScript
       and writes the results on  the  standard  output.   If  no
       files  are  specified,  or if - is one of the input files,
       the standard input is read.   The  following  options  are
       understood:  Print  num  copies of each page.  By default,
       only one copy is printed.  Specifies the code set the text
       file  is  in.   Specifies an alternate file which maps the
       code set to the postscript encodings.
       The file /usr/share/lib/hostfontdir/encodemap is  used  by
       default.   Print  files  using  font name.  Any PostScript
       font can be  used,  although  the  best  results  will  be
       obtained only with constant width fonts.  The default font
       is Courier.  Set the length of a page to  num  lines.   By
       default, num is 66.  Setting num to 0 is allowed, and will
       cause postprint to guess a value, based on the point  size
       that's  being used.  Magnify each logical page by the fac-
       tor num.  Pages are scaled  uniformly  about  the  origin,
       which  is located near the upper left corner of each page.
       The default magnification is 1.0.  Print num logical pages
       on  each  piece  of  paper,  where num can be any positive
       integer.  By default, num is set to 1.  Do not request the
       download  of  the  font file. If this option is specified,
       the %%DocumentFont ... lines are not put into the  output.
       This  causes  the download filter not to download the font
       file.  Print pages whose numbers are given in  the  comma-
       separated  list.   The  list contains single numbers N and
       ranges N1 - N2.  A missing N1 means  the  lowest  numbered
       page,  a  missing  N2  means  the highest.  Print files in
       either portrait or landscape mode.  Only the first charac-
       ter of mode is significant.  The default mode is portrait.
       Selects carriage return behavior.   Carriage  returns  are
       ignored  if num is 0, cause a return to column 1 if num is
       1, and generate a newline if num is 2.  The default num is
       0.   Print  files  using point size num.  When printing in
       landscape mode num is scaled by a factor that  depends  on
       the imaging area of the device.  The default size for por-
       trait mode is 10.  Assume tabs are set every num  columns,
       starting  with the first column.  By default, tabs are set
       every  8  columns.   Convert  codeX  to  Unicode  in   the
       PostScript,  for  example,  utf8. This code must match the
       list    of    Unicode     conversions     supported     in
       /usr/lib/iconv/iconv_data.  See  also  the manual page and
       Notices, below.

       PostScript Level 1 does not support  composite  fonts,  so
       Unicode  cannot be printed on PostScript Level 1 printers.
       Translate the origin num inches along the positive x axis.
       The  default  coordinate  system has the origin fixed near
       the upper left corner of the page, with positive x to  the
       right  and  positive  y down the page.  Positive num moves

                                                                1

       everything right.  The  default  offset  is  0.25  inches.
       Translate the origin num inches along the positive y axis.
       Positive num moves text up the page.  The  default  offset
       is -0.25 inches.

       A  new  logical  page  is started after 66 lines have been
       printed on the current page, or  whenever  an  ASCII  form
       feed  character is read.  The number of lines per page can
       be changed using the -l option.  Unprintable ASCII charac-
       ters are ignored, and lines that are too long are silently
       truncated by the printer.

       An exit status of 0 is returned if files were successfully
       processed.

       When  the  -U  option is used to convert the input data to
       Unicode, the encoding map (see -e) must map onto a Unicode
       encoding.   The   following   is   a  typical  invocation:
       /usr/lib/lp/postscript/postprint -eEURO -U utf8 -f Caslon-
       RomanBase  The  -e  EURO option maps onto the entry in the
       encodemap file (/usr/share/lib/hostfontdir/encodemap)  of:
       EURO  CaslonRomon-Unicode /usr/lib/lp/postscript/CaslonRo-
       man.encoding The font should be appended by  the  download
       filter, which requires the following entry in the font map
       file   (/usr/share/lib/hostfontdir/map):   CaslonRomanBase
       /usr/lib/lp/postscript/CaslonRoman.font

       To print file1 and file2 in landscape mode, issue the fol-
       lowing command: postprint  -pland  file1  file2  To  print
       three  logical  pages  on  each  physical page in portrait
       mode: postprint -n3 file
