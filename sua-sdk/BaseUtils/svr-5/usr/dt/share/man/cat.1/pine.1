       pine  is  a  screen-oriented message-handling tool. In its
       default configuration, pine offers an  intentionally  lim-
       ited  set  of functions geared toward the novice user, but
       it also has a growing list of optional power-user and per-
       sonal-preference  features.   pinef  is  a variant of pine
       that uses function keys rather than mnemonic single-letter
       commands.  The  basic  feature set of pine includes: View,
       Save, Export, Delete, Print, Reply,  and  Forward  message
       functions.  Ability to compose messages in a simple editor
       (Pico) with word-wrap and a  spelling  checker.   Messages
       can be postponed for later completion.  Full-screen selec-
       tion and management of message folders.  Address  book  to
       keep  a  list of long or frequently used addresses.  Users
       can define distribution lists and take addresses into  the
       address  book  from  incoming  mail without retyping them.
       New mail checking and  notification  occurs  automatically
       every  2.5  minutes  and  after certain commands, such as,
       Refresh-Screen  L.   On   line,   context-sensitive   help
       screens.   Full details of using the pine system are given
       in

       pine supports  MIME  (Multipurpose  Internet  Mail  Exten-
       sions),  an  Internet  standard for representing multipart
       and multimedia data in email. pine allows you to save MIME
       objects  to  files.  In some cases, pine can also initiate
       the correct program for viewing the object. pine uses  the
       system's  mailcap  configuration  file  to determine which
       program can process a particular MIME object type.  pine's
       message  composer  does not have integral multimedia capa-
       bility, but any type of data file,  including  multimedia,
       can  be  attached  to  a  text message and sent using MIME
       encoding rules. This allows any group or  individual  with
       MIME-capable mail software (such as pine, PC-Pine, or many
       other programs) to exchange formatted  documents,  spread-
       sheets, and image files using Internet email.

       pine  uses  the C client messaging API to access local and
       remote mail folders. This library provides  multiple  low-
       level  message-handling functions, including drivers for a
       variety of different mail file formats. It  also  includes
       routines to access remote mail and news servers using IMAP
       (Internet Message Access Protocol) and NNTP (Network  News
       Transport  Protocol).  Outgoing mail is usually handed off
       to the program, but it can optionally be  posted  directly
       using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

       causes pine to enter the message composer.  Special anony-
       mous  mode  for UWIN (University of Washington Information
       Navigator).  context-number is the number corresponding to
       the  folder  collection to which the -f command-line argu-
       ment should be applied. By default,  the  -f  argument  is
       applied  to  the  first defined folder collection.  Output
       diagnostic information at debug-level (0-9) to the current
       .pine-debug[1-4]  file.  A  value of 0 turns debugging off
       and suppresses the .pine-debug file.  Open folder (in  the
       first  defined  folder collection) instead of INBOX.  Open
       named text file and view with pine  browser.   List  valid
       command-line  options.   Start  up  in  the  FOLDER  INDEX
       screen.  Initial (comma separated list of) keystrokes that
       pine  should  execute  on  startup.  Use function keys for
       commands. This is the same as running the  command  pinef.
       Expand  all collections in the FOLDER LIST display.  Start
       up with current message-number  set  to  number.   Special
       mode for UWIN.  Open the first folder read-only.  Use con-
       fig-file as the personal configuration file instead of the
       default  .pinerc.   Use  config-file  as the configuration
       file instead of the default system-wide configuration file
       pine.conf.  Use restricted/demo mode. pine sends mail only
       to  itself  and  functions  as  if  Save  and  Export  are
       restricted.   Enable  Z  and  SIGTSTP  so pine can be sus-
       pended.  Produce a sample/fresh copy  of  the  system-wide
       configuration  file pine.conf on the standard output. This
       is distinct from the per-user .pinerc file.  Creates  aux-
       iliary index (lookup) file for addrbook and sorts addrbook
       in sort-order, which can be any of the  following:  don't-
       sort,  nickname,  fullname,  nickname-with-lists-last,  or
       fullname-with-lists-last.  This  is  useful  for  creating
       global  or  shared  address  books.  Output a fresh pinerc
       configuration to file.  Sort the FOLDER INDEX  to  display
       in  one  of  the following orders: arrival, subject, from,
       date, size, orderedsubj, or reverse. Arrival order is  the
       default. The orderedsubj choice simulates a threaded sort.
       Any sort can be reversed by adding /reverse to it. reverse
       by itself is the same as arrival/reverse.  Assign value to
       the  configuration  option.   For   example:   -signature-
       file=sig1  -feature-list=signature-at-bottom  feature-list
       values are additive.  There are  several  levels  of  pine
       configuration. Configuration values at a given level over-
       ride corresponding values at lower levels.   In  order  of
       increasing   precedence,  the  configuration  values  are:
       built-in  defaults  system-wide  pine.conf  file  personal
       .pinerc file (can be set using built-in Setup/Config menu)
       command-line  options  system-wide  pine.conf.fixed   file
       There is one exception to the rule that configuration val-
       ues are replaced by the value of  the  same  option  in  a
       higher-precedence  file.   The  feature-list  variable has
       values that are additive,  but  they  can  be  negated  by
       prepending no- to an individual feature name.

        pine  also uses the following environment variables: TERM
