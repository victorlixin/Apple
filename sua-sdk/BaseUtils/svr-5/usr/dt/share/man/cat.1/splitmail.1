       The splitmail program breaks a mail message  into  smaller
       pieces  using  the "message/partial" type defined by MIME,
       the proposed Internet standard for  multimedia  mail  for-
       mats.

       By  default, the message is taken from the standard input,
       or if filename, is specified, the message is read from the
       named file.  splitmail then produces a set of partial mes-
       sage files that are MIME compliant.

       The names of the output files  are  /tmp/split.1  for  the
       first part, and so on.  The prefix /tmp/split can be over-
       ridden using the -p option.

       splitmail supports the following command line options:

       specifies that the mail should  be  delivered.   specifies
       that the verbose flag should be passed to sendmail.  spec-
       ifies a chunk-size for splitting messages  that  overrides
       the  current  setting.   causes  splitmail to generate the
       pieces with similar (but not identical) message-id fields,
       in a format which allows them to be easily correlated with
       one another and which end with the suffix provided on  the
       command line after -i.  causes splitmail to use the speci-
       fied prefix rather than the  default  prefix  (/tmp/split)
       for  naming the split files.  causes splitmail to read the
       message from the specified file rather than  the  standard
       input.

       The  default  chunk  size  for  splitting messages is 250K
       bytes (that is, 250000, determined on a site basis) though
       this is also a compile-time option.  The size can be over-
       ridden with the -s switch, or with the  environment  vari-
       able SPLITSIZE.

       Messages  smaller  than  the chunk size will not be turned
       into partial messages, but will be  written  to  a  single
       file or delivered as a single message.

       SPLITSIZE  may be used to override the default chunk size,
       or to ensure that your messages are unlikely  ever  to  be
       split,  Setting  SPLITSIZE  to  a value of 4000K (4000000)
       will effectively ensure that splitting will not occur, but
       it  may also cause mail to be rejected by some mail trans-
       port software.

       If the size of the input is near the  limit,  and  if  the
       input  is  coming  from a file rather than standard input,
       splitmail will sometimes  estimate  the  number  of  parts
       wrong  and  will have to write out an extra part.  This is
       harmless but annoying.  It is especially annoying  if  the
       estimate was 2 but the real number was 1.
