       The man command locates and displays the manual page named
       title.   man  can also display a one-line summary selected
       either by keyword (-k) or by the  name  of  an  associated
       file (-e or -f).

       Because   commands  are  lowercase,  the  title  is almost
       always entered in lowercase.  There  are  instances  where
       title  contains mixed upper and lowercase letters, such as
       the Intro pages.

       man searches sections (if specified) for the titles.  sec-
       tion  is  either a number or letter (sometimes followed by
       additional mnemonic letters or numbers indicating the type
       of  manual page).  To search a group of sections, separate
       the sections with colons (:) on the command line.   If  no
       section  is specified, man searches all reference sections
       (giving preference to commands over functions)  for  title
       and displays the matching man pages.

       Manual  pages are HTML, formatted source prepared with the
       -man macro package, or nroff source files.

       -supplied reference pages are located in directories under
       /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man/html.section,  and  .../man.sec-
       tion.  LANG is the locale name of the man  page's  content
       language.         The        directory       /usr/lib/sco-
       help/en_US.ISO8859-1/man is linked to /usr/man for compat-
       ibility with &everest;tm.

       man  can  also locate man pages under any other directory.
       The subdirectories can be named using the format cat1  and
       man1  through  cat8  and man8 for compatibility with &UW;.
       Because man directories can be omitted  from  the  default
       installation,  they  might  not  reside  on your host; you
       might have to access the man pages on another system.  See
       man  searches for the requested manual page in this order:
       html.section

       If man finds the manual page in  this  section,  it  stops
       searching and displays this page.  cat.section
       man.section

       If   man   finds   no  HTML  version,  it  searches  these

                                                                1

man(1)                                                     man(1)

       directories.

       If the most recent copy is in a man.section source  direc-
       tory,  man  reformats  the version in the source directory
       and displays it using the default terminal type.  man also
       places  a  display  copy  of the output in the cat.section
       directory for future use.  A file that must  be  processed
       takes  longer to appear than a display copy.  cat1 through
       cat8
       man1 through man8

       If man does not find the requested page in the man.section
       or cat.section directories, it searches these directories.
       If no manual page is located, man prints an error message.

       By  default, man pipes its output through to handle paging
       and underlining on the screen.  If the standard output  is
       not  a  terminal, or if the - flag is given, man pipes its
       output through

       The following options are available: Pipes the  output  of
       man  through  cat  instead  of  more.   Specifies ALL mode
       (incompatible with the -F option).  man displays all  man-
       ual  pages  with matching titles (equivalent to specifying
       MODE=ALL in /etc/default/man).  See Leaves blank lines  in
       output.   Entries are normally padded with blank lines for
       line printer purposes; without this  option,  man  filters
       out  excess blank lines and does not display more than two
       consecutive blank lines.  Invokes if the display does  not
       support  character  formatting.   col is invoked automati-
       cally by man unless the terminal (defined by -T  term)  is
       one  of  the  following:  300,  300s, 450, 37, 4000a, 382,
       4014, tek, 1620, or X.  Specifies directory dir path to be
       added  to  the  default  search  path.  To specify several
       directories to search, separate the directory  names  with
       colons  (:)  on  the command line.  man attempts to locate
       and display the names and  short  descriptions  of  manual
       pages related to the given commands.  The commands can  be
       separated by commas, or by spaces if the list is  enclosed
       in  quotes.   The full name of command must be given; how-
       ever, man is case-insensitive.

       man -e and man -f are equivalent to Specifies  FIRST  mode
       (incompatible  with the -a option).  man displays only the
       first matching title (equivalent to specifying  MODE=FIRST
       in  /etc/default/man).   See man prints one-line summaries
       from the database that contain any of the given  keywords.

       man -k is equivalent to man uses macro-package rather than
       the  standard  -man  macros  defined  in  /usr/ucblib/doc-
       tools/tmac/an for formatting manual pages (see

       When  specifying  the  -m option to man, you must give the
       full pathname:  man  -m  /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/bib  ls

                                                                2

man(1)                                                     man(1)

       Specifies  the  search  path  for manual pages.  path is a
       colon-separated list of directories  that  contain  manual
       page directory subtrees.  When used with the -k, -e, or -f
       options, the -M option must  appear  first.   man  assumes
       that each directory in path contains subdirectories of the
       form man.[1-8] followed by mnemonic strings that  indicate
       the interface.  Specifies a paging program pager to use to
       display the entry.  Paging systems, such as or  any  other
       custom pagers are valid arguments for this option.

       You   can   override   the   default  pager,  pg  (set  in
       /etc/default/man) by setting the environment  variable  to
       the  name of another paging program.  The pager defined by
       -p overrides both of these.  Specify the manual page  sec-
       tion  name  (section) to be used (the first argument after
       the options will be treated as section name(s).   The  man
       command   first  checks  whether  multiple  section  names
       (delimited by the : character) or  sections  1  to  8  are
       specified.   If  not,  man  matches this argument with the
       existing man section names in the  /etc/default/manSection
       file.   If it finds a match, man treats this argument as a
       section name, otherwise it treats it as a man page  title.
       Passes  the unprocessed manual page to proc (where proc is
       or any other command script in /usr/ucb).  When used  with
       -, -t troff results in the manual page being filtered as a
       PostScript file and sent to the  printer.   Specifies  the
       terminal  type  (see  and man formats the entry and passes
       the given term  value  to  the  processing  program,  then
       prints  it on the standard output (usually, the terminal).
       Prints only the pathnames of the entries.

       The /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man/index.section files list the
       manual  page names, subsidiary entries, and the file where
       they are described.  The file format is described  on  the
       manual page.

       The  /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man/.SectionData/whatis/section
       files are databases of keywords created  using  These  are
       merged  into  a  master  keyword  database,  /usr/lib/sco-
       help/LANG/man/whatis, used by the and commands.  The  file
       format is described on the manual page.

       The file contains the default settings for man.  To select
       a different paging system,  search  path,  terminal  type,
       search  order,  mode,  and  processor  for the man system,
       change the information in this file.

       The  following  variables  are  set  in  /etc/default/man:
       Changes or augments the default path that man searches for
       entries.  man looks for the specified manual page title in
       the section directories in the order specified by MANPATH.
       Multiple directories set with this variable must be delim-
       ited by colon characters (:).

                                                                3

man(1)                                                     man(1)

       If the MANPATH environment variable is present, the direc-
       tories are searched in the order that  they  appear.   The
       first   path   in   the   MANPATH  list  is  specified  as
       /usr/lib/scohelp/%L/man.  If the user sets LANG to one  of
       C,  en*,  or  POSIX, the man command ignores this path and
       searches the next specified path,  /usr/man  (the  default
       English  path).   Otherwise, man substitutes the first two
       characters from the user's LANG (such as, ja for Japanese)
       for %L and searches this path first.

       The  entry  scohelp must appear in the MANPATH list for to
       be included in the search path.  Alternate  subdirectories
       are  expected  to  have the same hierarchical structure as
       the default directories  in  /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man  or
       the traditional directory structure under /usr/man.  See

       If  the man page is not found in the directories specified
       by MANPATH, man returns an error.

       The -M option overrides this  value.   Specifies  the  TCP
       port  number  for  the remote manual page server (normally
       set to 457).  Defines the name of the host machine that is
       serving  manual  pages  using  If  set  to  localhost (the
       default), man connects to the scohelphttp  daemon  on  the
       local  system  and  searches  for  the  pages locally.  If
       MANSERVER specifies a remote manual page server, man opens
       a  remote  socket connection to the scohelphttpd daemon on
       the remote system.  If set to ALL, displays  all  matching
       manual  pages.   If  set to FIRST, displays only the first
       matching title.

       The -a and -F options override this value.  Specifies  the
       order  in  which  to search the manual page sections for a
       specified manual page title if a section is not also spec-
       ified.   To  change  the search order for manual page sec-
       tions, edit the list.  Be certain the  section  names  are
       separated with colons (:).  Section names not specified in
       ORDER are searched in arbitrary order after  those  speci-
       fied.   Specifies the paging program to use to deliver the
       output of man to the screen.  If not set,  man  uses  more
       -s.  See

       The -p option overrides this value.  Specifies the name of
       the formatter to use by default when the -t flag is given.
       Specifies  the  terminal  type  on  which  output is to be
       printed.  The -T option overrides this value.
