       mt [-f tape device] command [count]

       The mt command provides rudimentary control of tape drives
       through an interface that is portable across many  differ-
       ent vendors' systems.

       The  mt  command  takes the following options: This option
       specifies the target tape drive.  The argument tape  drive
       is  the  pathname of a raw tape device.  The ``no-rewind''
       interface to the  specified  tape  drive  should  be  used
       (e.g.,  /dev/rmt/ntape1).   If this option is not included
       on the command line, mt operates on the  system's  default
       tape  device.   The  command  argument  specifies the tape
       operation to be performed.  Two  operations  are  defined:
       rewind (rewind the tape) and fsf (forward space one file).
       This argument specifies the number of times the  specified
       operation  is  to  be  done.   If  the rewind operation is
       requested, count is ignored.  If count is not included  on
       the command line, it defaults to a value of 1.

       mt  returns  ``0''  on  successful completion.  If command
       line syntax is incorrect or a command is  not  recognized,
       it  returns  ``1''.  If a tape operation fails, it returns
       ``2''.
