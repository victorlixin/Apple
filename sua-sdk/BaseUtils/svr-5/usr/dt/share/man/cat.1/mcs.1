       The  mcs  command  is  used  to  manipulate  a section, by
       default the .comment section, in an ELF object  file.   It
       is  used  to  add to, delete, print, and compress the con-
       tents of a section in an ELF object file, and  only  print
       the contents of a section in a COFF object file.  mcs must
       be given one or more of the options described  below.   It
       applies each of the options in order to each file.

       The following options are available.  Append string to the
       comment section of the ELF object files.  If  string  con-
       tains  embedded  blanks,  it must be enclosed in quotation
       marks.  Compress the contents of the  comment  section  of
       the  ELF object files.  All duplicate entries are removed.
       The ordering of the remaining entries  is  not  disturbed.
       Delete  the  contents  of the comment section from the ELF
       object files.  The section header for the comment  section
       is  also removed.  Specify the name of the comment section
       to access if other than .comment.  By default,  mcs  deals
       with  the section named .comment.  This option can be used
       to specify another section.  Print the uninterpreted  con-
       tents  of the comment section on the standard output.  The
       section contents are not formatted.  All  data,  including
       raw  binary  data, are printed.  Print the contents of the
       comment section on  the  standard  output.   Each  section
       printed  is  tagged  by the name of the file from which it
       was extracted, using the format filename[member_name]: for
       archive  files;  and filename: for other files.  Print, on
       standard error, the version number of mcs.

       If the input file  is  an  archive  [see  the  archive  is
       treated as a set of individual files.  For example, if the
       -a option is specified, the string is appended to the com-
       ment  section  of  each ELF object file in the archive; if
       the archive member is not an ELF object file, then  it  is
       left unchanged.

       If  mcs  is executed on an archive file the archive symbol
       table will be removed, unless only the -p option has  been
       specified.   The  archive symbol table must be restored by
       executing the ar command with the  -s  option  before  the
       archive can be linked by the ld command.  mcs will produce
       appropriate warning messages when this situation arises.

       Characters from supplementary code sets  can  be  used  in
       object-files.   Comments  using characters from supplemen-
       tary code sets can be specified with the -a option.

       mcs cannot add to, delete or compress the  contents  of  a
       section that is contained within a segment.

       The section name specified in name with the -n option must
       contain ASCII characters only.
