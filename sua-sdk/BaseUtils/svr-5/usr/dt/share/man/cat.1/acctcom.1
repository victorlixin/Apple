       acctcom reads file, the standard input, or /var/adm/pacct,
       in the form described by and writes  selected  records  to
       the standard output.  Each record represents the execution
       of one process.  The output shows the COMMAND NAME,  USER,
       TTYNAME, START TIME, END TIME, REAL (SEC), CPU (SEC), MEAN
       SIZE (K), and optionally, F (the  fork/exec  flag:  1  for
       fork  without  exec),  STAT  (the system exit status), HOG
       FACTOR, KCORE MIN, CPU FACTOR, CHARS  TRNSFD,  and  BLOCKS
       READ (total blocks read and written).

       A  #  is  prefixed  to the command name if the command was
       executed by a privileged user.  If a process is not  asso-
       ciated  with  a known terminal, a ? is printed in the TTY-
       NAME field.

       If no files are specified, and if the  standard  input  is
       associated  with  a  terminal or /dev/null (as is the case
       when using & in the shell), /var/adm/pacct is read; other-
       wise, the standard input is read.

       If  any  file  arguments are given, they are read in their
       respective order.  Each file  is  normally  read  forward,
       that  is,  in  chronological  order  by process completion
       time.  The file /var/adm/pacct is usually the current file
       to  be examined; a busy system may need several such files
       of  which  all  but  the  current  file   are   found   in
       /var/adm/pacct incr.

       The  options  are:  Show some average statistics about the
       processes selected.  The statistics will be printed  after
       the  output  records.  Read backwards, showing latest com-
       mands first.  This option has no effect when the  standard
       input  is  read.  Print the fork/exec flag and system exit
       status columns in the output.  The numeric output for this
       option  will  be  in  octal.  Instead of mean memory size,
       show the fraction of total available CPU time consumed  by
       the  process during its execution.  This ``hog factor'' is
       computed  as   (total   CPU time)/(elapsed time).    Print
       columns  containing the I/O counts in the output.  Instead
       of memory size, show total kcore-minutes.  Show mean  core
       size  (the  default).  Show CPU factor [user-time/(system-
       time + user-time)].  Show separate  system  and  user  CPU
       times.   Exclude  column  headings  from the output.  Show
       only processes belonging to terminal /dev/line.  Show only
       processes  belonging  to  user that may be specified by: a
       user ID, a login name that is then converted to a user ID,
       a  #  that  designates  only those processes executed by a
       privileged user, or ?  that  designates  only  those  pro-
       cesses  associated with unknown user IDs.  The # and the ?
       should be typed as \# and \?, respectively, to prevent the

                                                                1

       shell  from  interpreting the # as the start of a comment,
       or the ? as a pattern.  Show only processes  belonging  to
       group.  The group may be designated by either the group ID
       or group name.  Select  processes  existing  at  or  after
       time,  given  in  the  format hr[:min[:sec]].  Select pro-
       cesses existing  at  or  before  time.   Select  processes
       starting  at or after time.  Select processes ending at or
       before time.  Using the same time for both -S and -E shows
       the  processes  that  existed at time.  Show only commands
       matching pattern that may be a regular  expression  as  in
       except  + means one or more occurrences.  Do not print any
       output records, just print the average statistics as  with
       the -a option.  Copy selected process records in the input
       data format to ofile; suppress printing to  standard  out-
       put.  Show only processes that exceed factor, where factor
       is the ``hog factor'' as explained  in  option  -h  above.
       Show  only  processes  with  CPU system time exceeding sec
       seconds.  Show only processes with total CPU time (system-
       time  +  user-time) exceeding sec seconds.  Show only pro-
       cesses transferring more characters than the cutoff number
       given by chars.

       acctcom  reports  only  on processes that have terminated;
       use for active processes.

       If time exceeds the present time, then time is interpreted
       as occurring on the previous day.
