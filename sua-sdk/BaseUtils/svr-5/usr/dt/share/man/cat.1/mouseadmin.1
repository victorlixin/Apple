       mouseadmin allows any user with system administrator priv-
       ileges to add or  delete  mouse  devices.   Users  without
       appropriate  privileges  will  only be allowed to list the
       current mouse and  display  assignments.   The  mouseadmin
       command issued without arguments will execute in menu mode
       providing the user with a listing of  current  assignments
       and  a  selection  menu of operations.  You can use the -t
       command line option or the T menu option to test the newly
       configured mouse.

       The command line arguments are defined as follows:

       assign  mouse  device (PS2  BUS  tty00  s0tty0  . . . ) to
       terminal (console  s0vt00  . . . ).  do not  validate  for
       BUS  mouse  in  system configuration.  (This option should
       only be used within  install  scripts.)   delete  terminal
       assignment.   specify an interrupt vector for a BUS mouse.
       When  using  the  -i  option  mouse  must  be  BUS.   list
       mouse/display assignments.  build mouse/display pair table
       without downloading to driver.  (This option  should  only
       be  used  within install scripts.)  test currently config-
       ured mouse.  If the mouse is there and detected the return
       will  be  ``0'';  otherwise   the  return will be ``1'' or
       higher.  verbose output. mouseadmin actively searches  the
       PS/2  port  and  the  serial  ports  for a mouse, and then
       reports what it has found.  It does not look for bus mice.
       This option is mainly for use within install scripts.
