       The  mtools  package  is available either on the Skunkware
       CD-ROM included in the UnixWare 7 media kit  or  from  the
       "File  Managers"  section  of  the  Skunkware web/ftp site
       (http://www.caldera.com/skunkware/uw7/fileutil/fileu-
       til.html).

       To  install from the Skunkware 7 CD-ROM, insert the CD-ROM
       into the drive and issue the command (as a system owner):
            #  pkgadd  -d  /dev/cdrom/<devicename>  mtools  where
       <devicename>  is  the  name of the CD-ROM device (this may
       vary from system to system).

       Alternatively, an interactive graphical  installation  can
       be  performed  by  running  /usr/X/bin/PackageMgr : Select
       "CD-ROM_1" from the "Install from" Combo  Box.   Wait  for
       the  Packages to be scanned then select the mtools package
       and press the install button.

       A gzip-compressed  pkgadd-installable  datastream  of  the
       mtools    package    can   be   downloaded   via   either:
       http://www.caldera.com/skunkware/uw7/fileu-
       til/mtools/mtools.pkg.gz                                or
       ftp://ftp.caldera.com/skunkware/uw7/fileu-
       til/mtools/mtools.pkg.gz

       After downloading, uncompress the package with:
           # gunzip mtools.pkg.gz and install with:
           #  pkgadd  -d /path/to/mtools.pkg The mtools utilities
       are installed in /usr/local/bin and the corresponding man-
       ual pages in /usr/local/man. For this reason it is usually
       a good idea to add /usr/local/bin to the default execution
       PATH and /usr/local/man to MANPATH.

       A  good  starting  point  for gaining familiarity with the
       mtools is the mtools manual page:
           $ more /usr/local/man/cat1/mtools.1 or
           $ man mtools

                                                                1
