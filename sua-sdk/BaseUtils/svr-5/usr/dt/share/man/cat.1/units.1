       units  converts  quantities  expressed in various standard
       scales to their equivalents in  other  scales.   It  works
       interactively  in  this fashion: You have:  inch You want:
       cm      * 2.540000e+00      / 3.937008e-01

       A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of
       units optionally preceded by a numeric multiplier.  Powers
       are indicated by suffixed positive integers,  division  by
       the usual sign: You have:  15 lbs force/in2 You want:  atm
            * 1.020689e+00      / 9.797299e-01

       units only does multiplicative scale changes; thus it  can
       convert  Kelvin to Rankine, but not Celsius to Fahrenheit.
       Most familiar units, abbreviations,  and  metric  prefixes
       are  recognized,  together  with  a  generous leavening of
       exotica and a few constants of nature including:

       ratio of circumference to diameter speed of  light  charge
       on  an  electron  acceleration  of  gravity same as g Avo-
       gadro's number pressure head  per  unit  height  of  water
       astronomical unit

       Pound  is  not  recognized as a unit of mass; lb is.  Com-
       pound names are run together,  (for  example,  lightyear).
       British  units that differ from their USA counterparts are
       prefixed thus: brgallon.  For a complete  list  of  units,
