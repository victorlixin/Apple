       sccsdiff  compares two versions of an SCCS file and gener-
       ates the differences between the two versions.  Any number
       of SCCS files may be specified, but arguments apply to all
       files.  SID1 and SID2 specify the deltas of an  SCCS  file
       that  are to be compared.  Versions are passed to bdiff in
       the order given.  Pipe output for each file through pr.  n
       is  the  file  segment  size that bdiff will pass to diff.
       This option is useful when diff fails due to a high system
       load.
