       The  strip  command  strips  the  symbol  table, debugging
       information, and line number information from  ELF  object
       files;  COFF object files can no longer be stripped.  Once
       this stripping process has been done, no  symbolic  debug-
       ging  access  will  be available for that file; therefore,
       this command is normally run only  on  production  modules
       that have been debugged and tested.

       If  strip  is  executed  on  a common archive file [see in
       addition to processing the members, strip will remove  the
       archive  symbol  table.   The archive symbol table must be
       restored by executing  the  command  with  the  -s  option
       before  the  archive  can be linked by the command.  strip
       will produce appropriate warning messages when this situa-
       tion arises.

       The  amount  of  information  stripped from the ELF object
       file can be controlled  by  using  any  of  the  following
       options:

       Strip  line number information only; do not strip the sym-
       bol table or debugging information.   Print,  on  standard
       error, the version number of strip.  Do not strip the sym-
       bol table; debugging and line number  information  may  be
       stripped.

       strip is used to reduce the file storage overhead taken by
       the object file.

       temporary files usually /var/tmp but can be  redefined  by
       setting the environment variable TMPDIR [see tempnam in

       The symbol table section will not be removed if it is con-
       tained within a segment, or the file is either a  relocat-
       able or dynamic shared object.

       The line number and debugging sections will not be removed
       if they are contained within a segment, or  their  associ-
       ated relocation section is contained within a segment.
