       rmdel removes the delta specified by the SID (SCCS identi-
       fication string) from each named SCCS file.  The delta  to
       be  removed  must be the newest (most recent) delta in its
       branch in the delta chain of each  named  SCCS  file.   In
       addition,  the  delta specified must not be that of a ver-
       sion being edited for the purpose of making a delta;  that
       is,  if  a  p.file exists for the named SCCS file (see the
       delta specified must  not  appear  in  any  entry  of  the
       p.file.

       The  -r  option specifies the SID level of the delta to be
       removed.

       If a directory is named, rmdel behaves as though each file
       in  the  directory  were specified as a named file, except
       that non-SCCS files (last component of the path name  does
       not  begin  with  s.)   and  unreadable files are silently
       ignored.  If a name of - is given, the standard  input  is
       read;  each  line of the standard input is taken to be the
       name of an SCCS file to be processed; non-SCCS  files  and
       unreadable files are silently ignored.

       The rules governing the removal of a delta are as follows:
       if you make a delta and have appropriate file permissions,
       you  can  remove  it; if you own the file and directory in
       which a new delta file resides, you can remove the  delta.
