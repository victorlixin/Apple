       Use the newvt command to open a new virtual terminal.  The
       newly opened virtual terminal will inherit  your  environ-
       ment.

       Up  to  15 virtual terminals are supported (the default is
       15). See for information on how to change  the  number  of
       available  virtual  terminals on your system.  Specifies a
       program (prog) to execute in  the  new  virtual  terminal.
       Without the -e option, the program pointed to by the SHELL
       environment variable is started in the new virtual  termi-
       nal.   If $SHELL is NULL or points to a nonexecutable pro-
       gram, then /bin/sh is invoked.  The new  virtual  terminal
       will close when you exit the program.  Specifies a partic-
       ular virtual terminal (vt_number)  to  open.   If  the  -n
       option  is  not specified, then the next available virtual
       terminal is opened.

       The newvt command will fail  under  the  following  condi-
       tions:  An invalid option is specified.  The device cannot
       be opened.  newvt is invoked from a remote  terminal.   No
       virtual terminals are available (-n option not specified).
       The requested virtual terminal is not available (-n option
       specified).   The  requested  virtual  terminal  cannot be
       opened.  The specified  command  cannot  be  executed  (-e
       option  specified).  The $SHELL program cannot be executed
       ($SHELL set and -e option not specified).  /dev/vtmon can-
       not be opened.

       No graphical applications should be run in vt0 if there is
       the possibility that they  may  hang.  Also,  the  -F  key
       should  not be used on vt0 when running a graphical appli-
       cation. Running autocad on vt0 and using the  -F  keys  to
       exit the application kills vt0.
