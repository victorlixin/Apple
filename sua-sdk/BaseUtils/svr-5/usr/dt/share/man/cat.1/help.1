       help finds information to explain a message from a command
       or explain the use of a SCCS command.  Zero or more  argu-
       ments  may  be  supplied.  If no arguments are given, help
       will prompt for one.

       The arguments may be either information within the  paren-
       theses following a message or SCCS command names.

       The response of the program will be the explanatory infor-
       mation related to the argument, if there is any.

       When all else fails, try help stuck.

       Note that the output varies from locale to  locale,  since
       help uses message files. However, input and command syntax
       does not vary.
