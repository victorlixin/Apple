       ckkeywd prompts a user and  validates  the  response.   It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response should be one of a list  of  keywords,  text  for
       help  and  error  messages,  and a default value (which is
       returned if the  user  responds  with  a  ).   The  answer
       returned  from  this command must match one of the defined
       list of keywords.

       All messages are limited in length to  70  characters  and
       are  formatted automatically.  Any white space used in the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels  the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is placed
       at the beginning or  end  of  a  message  definition,  the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If the prompt, help or error message is not  defined,  the
       default  message  (as  defined  under ``Notices'') is dis-
       played.  Do not allow quit as a valid response.  Use width
       as  the  line length for prompt, help, and error messages.
       The default value is default.  The default  is  not  vali-
       dated and so does not have to meet any criteria.  The help
       message is help.  The error message is error.  The  prompt
       message  is  prompt.   Send process ID pid a signal if the
       user chooses to abort.  When quit is chosen,  send  signal
       to  the  process  whose pid is specified by the -k option.
       If no signal is specified, use SIGTERM.  The  keyword,  or
       list  of keywords, against which the answer is to be veri-
       fied is keyword.
