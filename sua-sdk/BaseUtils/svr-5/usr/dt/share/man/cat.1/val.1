       val determines if the specified file is an SCCS file meet-
       ing the characteristics specified by the optional argument
       list.   Arguments  to  val  may  appear in any order.  The
       arguments consist of keyletter arguments, which begin with
       a -, and named files.

       val has a special argument, -, which causes reading of the
       standard input until an end-of-file condition is detected.
       Each  line read is independently processed as if it were a
       command line argument list.

       val generates diagnostic messages on  standard  error  for
       each  command  line and file processed, and also returns a
       single 8-bit code on exit as described below.

       The keyletter  arguments  are  defined  as  follows.   The
       effects  of  any keyletter argument apply independently to
       each named file on the command line.  The presence of this
       argument  silences  the diagnostic message normally gener-
       ated on standard error for  any  error  that  is  detected
       while  processing each named file on a given command line.
       The argument value SID (SCCS identification string) is  an
       SCCS  delta  number.   A check is made to determine if the
       SID is ambiguous (for example, -r1 is ambiguous because it
       physically does not exist but implies 1.1, 1.2, and so on,
       which may exist)  or  invalid  (for  example,  \*-r1.0  or
       \*-r1.1.0 are invalid because neither can exist as a valid
       delta number).  If the SID is valid and not  ambiguous,  a
       check  is  made  to  determine if it actually exists.  The
       argument value name is compared with the SCCS %M%  keyword
       in  file.   The  argument  value type is compared with the
       SCCS %Y% keyword in file.  The 8-bit code returned by  val
       is  a disjunction of the possible errors; it can be inter-
       preted as a bit string where (moving from left  to  right)
       set bits are interpreted as follows:

       bit 0 = missing file argument bit 1 = unknown or duplicate
       keyletter argument bit 2 = corrupted SCCS  file  bit  3  =
       cannot  open  file or file not SCCS bit 4 = SID is invalid
       or ambiguous bit 5 = SID does not exist bit 6  =  %Y%,  -y
       mismatch  bit  7 = %M%, -m mismatch val can process two or
       more files on a given command line and in turn can process
       multiple  command lines (when reading the standard input).
       In these cases an aggregate code is returned: a logical OR
       of the codes generated for each command line and file pro-
       cessed.

                                                                1
