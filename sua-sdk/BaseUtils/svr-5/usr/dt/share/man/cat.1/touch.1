       touch  causes  the  access  and modification times of each
       argument to be updated.  The file name is  created  if  it
       does  not exist.  If no time is specified the current time
       is used.  (See for a description of the time  format  used
       in the second synopsis.)  touch has the following options:
       Update only the access time.  Update only the modification
       time.

       If  neither -a nor -m is specified, the effect is the same
       as -am.  Silently prevent touch from creating the file  if
       it  did  not previously exist.  Use the corresponding time
       of ref_file instead of the current time.  Use time instead
       of the current time. time is a decimal number of the form:
       [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] where each two digits represent  the
       following:  month  of  the  year  (01-12) day of the month
       (01-31) hour of the day (00-23) minute of the hour (00-59)
       first two digits of the year (the century) second two dig-
       its of the year second of the minute (00-61)

       CC and YY are optional.  If neither is given, the  current
       year is assumed.  If YY is specified, but CC is not, CC is
       derived as follows:
       ------------------------
       If YY is:   CC becomes:
       ------------------------
       69-99       19
       00-68       20
       The range for SS is (00-61), because of leap  seconds.  If
       SS  is 60 or 61 and the resulting time, as affected by the
       TZ environment variable, does not refer to a leap  second;
       the  resulting  time  shall  be one or two seconds after a
       time where SS is 59. If SS is not given it is  assumed  to
       be zero.

       The  return  code  from  touch  is the number of files for
       which  the  times  could  not  be  successfully   modified
       (including files that did not exist and were not created).

       If the POSIX2 environment variable is  set  and  exported,
       files that did not exist and were not created are not con-
       sidered to be errors, and will not  increment  the  return
       code.

                                                                1

       Users familiar with the BSD environment will find that the
       -f option is accepted, but  ignored.   The  -f  option  is
       unnecessary  since  touch will succeed for all files owned
       by the user regardless of the permissions on the files.

       The touch command assumes that an operand is a date if and
       only  if all of the following are true: -r, -t, and -f are
       not specified there are at least two operands  the  second
       operand  is  8  or  10 digits The -t time option should be
       used in preference to the second synopsis usage, since the
       second synopsis may not be supported in future releases.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
