       pfmt uses format for  printf  style  formatting  of  args.
       pfmt encapsulates the output in the standard error message
       format and displays it on stderr.

       The following options are available.   Specify  the  label
       string  to  be  displayed  with  the message (for example,
       UX:cat).  label is a character string  that  is  automati-
       cally suffixed with a colon :.  When unspecified, no label
       is displayed as part of the message.  Specify the severity
       string  to  be  displayed  with  the  message.  Acceptable
       strings include the standard severities  in  either  their
       print  string (that is, HALT, ERROR, INFO, WARNING, and TO
       FIX) or keyword (that is, halt,  error,  info,  warn,  and
       action)  forms, or any other user-defined string.  A user-
       defined string will be assigned the integer severity value
       of  5.  The severity will be suffixed with a colon :.  The
       ERROR severity will be used if no severity is specified.

       The keywords and definitions of  the  standard  levels  of
       severity  are:  application has encountered a severe fault
       and is halting application has detected a  fault  applica-
       tion  has detected a condition that is out of the ordinary
       and might be a problem application is  providing  informa-
       tion about a condition that is not in error do not print a
       severity message

       Specify that a  localized  version  of  format  should  be
       retrieved  from a locale-specific message database.  cata-
       log indicates  the  message  database  that  contains  the
       localized  version  of the format string.  catalog must be
       limited  to  14  characters.   These  characters  must  be
       selected from a set of all characters values, excluding \0
       (NULL) or the characters /
        (slash) and : (colon).  Message catalogs are created with

       msgid is a positive number that indicates the index of the
       string into the message database.

       If catalog does not exist in the current  locale  (identi-
       fied by the LC_MESSAGES or LANG environment variables), or
       if msgid is out of bounds, pfmt will attempt  to  retrieve
       the  message  from the C locale.  If this second retrieval
       fails, pfmt uses the format string as passed on  the  com-
       mand line.

       pfmt  will  output  Message  not  found!!\n  as the format
       string if msgid is not a valid number.

                                                                1

       pfmt displays error  messages  in  the  following  format:
       label: severity: text

       If  no  label  was  defined using the -l label option, the
       message is displayed in the format: severity: text

       If pfmt is called twice to display an error message and  a
       helpful  action  or  recovery message, the output can look
       like the following: label: severity: text label:  TO  FIX:
       text

       Upon success, pfmt exits with code 0.

       Upon  failure,  pfmt exits with the following codes: write
       error syntax error
