       ckitem  builds  a  menu and prompts the user to choose one
       item  from  a  menu  of  items.   It  then   verifies  the
       response.   Options  for  this command define, among other
       things, a prompt message whose response is  a  menu  item,
       text  for  help  and  error  messages, and a default value
       (which is returned if the user responds with a ).

       By default, the menu is formatted so  that  each  item  is
       prepended by a number and is printed in columns across the
       terminal.  Column length  is  determined  by  the  longest
       choice.  Items are alphabetized.

       All  messages  are  limited in length to 70 characters and
       are formatted automatically.  Any white space used in  the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is  placed
       at  the  beginning  or  end  of  a message definition, the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If  the  prompt, help or error message is not defined, the
       default message (as defined  under  ``Notices'')  is  dis-
       played.

       Two  visual tool modules are linked to the ckitem command.
       They are erritem (which formats and displays an error mes-
       sage) and helpitem (which formats and displays a help mes-
       sage).  These modules should be used in  conjunction  with
       FML objects.  In this instance, the FML object defines the
       prompt.  When choice is defined in these modules, the mes-
       sages describe the available menu choice (or choices).

       The  options  and  arguments  for this command are: Do not
       allow quit as a valid response.  Use  width  as  the  line
       length for prompt, help, and error messages.  Display menu
       items as an unnumbered list.  Do not display menu items in
       alphabetical  order.   Return  only  one menu token.  file
       contains a list of menu items to be displayed.  (The  for-
       mat  of  this  file is: tokendescription.  Lines beginning
       with a pound sign  (#)  are  comments  and  are  ignored.)
       Print  label  above  the  menu.  invis specifies invisible
       menu choices (choices not to be printed in the menu).  For
       example,  all used as an invisible choice would mean it is
       a valid option but does  not  appear  in  the  menu.   Any

                                                                1

       number  of  invisible  choices  may be defined.  Invisible
       choices should be made known  to  a  user  either  in  the
       prompt  or  in a help message.  The maximum number of menu
       choices allowed is m.  The default value is default.   The
       default  is not validated and so does not have to meet any
       criteria.  The help message is help.  The error message is
       error.  The prompt message is prompt.  Send process ID pid
       a signal if the user chooses to abort.  When quit is  cho-
       sen,  send signal to the process whose pid is specified by
       the -k option.  If no signal is  specified,  use  SIGTERM.
       Defines  menu  items.   Items should be separated by white
       space  or  newline.   Menu  items  with  descriptions  are
       enclosed  in  quotation  marks where the first word is the
       actual item, followed by a TAB, and  the  remaining  words
       are used as the description.  The command: ckitem "choice1
       the first  choice"  choice2  returns:  1   choice1     the
       first choice 2  choice2

       Enter selection [?,??,q]:

       The user may input the number of the menu item if  choices
       are  numbered  or  as  much  of  the string required for a
       unique identification of the item.  Long menus  are  paged
       with 10 items per page.

       When menu entries are defined both in a file (by using the
       -f option) and also on the command line, they are  usually
       combined  alphabetically.   However,  if  the -n option is
       used to suppress alphabetical ordering, then  the  entries
       defined  in  the  file  are  shown  first, followed by the
       options defined on the command line.

       The  default  prompt  for  ckitem  is:   Enter   selection
       [?,??,q]:  One question mark gives a help message and then
       redisplays the prompt.  Two question marks  gives  a  help
       message  and  then redisplays the menu label, the menu and
       the prompt.

       The default error message is: ERROR: Entry does not  match
       available  menu  selection.   Enter the number of the menu
       item you wish to select, or the token which is  associated
       with  the  menu  item,  or a partial string which uniquely
       identifies the token for  the  menu  item.   Enter  ??  to
       reprint  the menu.  The default help message is: Enter the
       number of the menu item you wish to select, or  the  token
       which  is  associated  with  the  menu  item, or a partial
       string which uniquely identifies the token  for  the  menu
       item.  Enter ?? to reprint the menu.  When the quit option
       is chosen (and allowed), q  is  returned  along  with  the

                                                                2
