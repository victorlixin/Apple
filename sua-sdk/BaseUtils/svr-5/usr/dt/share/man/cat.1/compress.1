       compress  takes  a  file and compresses it to the smallest
       possible size,  creates  a  compressed  output  file,  and
       removes the original file unless the -c option is present.
       Compression is achieved by encoding common strings  within
       the  file.   uncompress  restores  a previously compressed
       file to its uncompressed state and removes the  compressed
       version.   zcat  uncompresses  and  displays a file on the
       standard output.

       If no file is specified on the command line  or  if  -  is
       given  as  the file name, input is taken from the standard
       input and the output is directed to the  standard  output.
       Output  defaults  to  a file with the same filename as the
       input file with the  suffix  .Z  or  it  can  be  directed
       through  the  standard  output.  The output files have the
       same permissions and ownership as the corresponding  input
       files  or  the  user's  standard  permissions if output is
       directed through the standard output.

       If no space is saved by compression, the  output  file  is
       not  written  unless the -F flag is present on the command
       line.

       The following options are available from the command line:
       Decompresses  a  compressed  file.   Specifies the maximum
       number of bits to use in encoding.  Writes output  on  the
       standard output and does not remove original file.  Forces
       output file to be written, even if one already exists, and
       even  if  no space is saved by compressing.  Writes output
       file even if compression saves  no  space.   Generates  no
       output  except error messages, if any.  Prints the name of
       the file being compressed and the percentage  of  compres-
       sion  achieved.   With  uncompress, the name of the uncom-
       pressed file is printed.

       The compress, uncompress,  and  zcat  commands  have  been
       updated to handle files larger than 2GB.
