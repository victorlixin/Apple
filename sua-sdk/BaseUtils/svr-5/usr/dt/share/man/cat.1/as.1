       The as command produces an object file from the concatena-
       tion  of  the specified assembly language input files.  At
       least one source file must be specified, except  when  the
       -V  option  is given.  The name -' designates the standard
       input, and may be specified anywhere within  the  list  of
       files.

       The  recognized  assembly language does not include a gen-
       eral macro processing capability.   Instead,  as  provides
       for optional preprocessing of the input by the m4 command.
       [See

       The following options  may  be  specified  in  any  order:
       Writes  the  assembler's  packaging,  release, and version
       information on the standard error output.   As  a  special
       case,  the  assembler does no other processing if no input
       files are specified.  Accepts  input  that  contains  old-
       style  (COFF)  directives.  Nevertheless, most such direc-
       tives are still ineffective, as the assembler generates an
       ELF  object  file.   Sends  the input through the m4 macro
       processing command prior to assembly.  All  file  operands
       are  passed  unmodified  to the m4 command.  (By using the
       ``--'' option-terminator, m4 options can be preserved  and
       passed  through  to  the m4 command; see the EXAMPLES sec-
       tion, below.)  If present,  the  predefined  macros  file,
       LIBDIR/cm4defs,  will  be  given  to the m4 command as the
       initial  input  file.   Appends  the  assembler's  release
       information  to the .comment section of the generated out-
       put object file if yn is ``y''; otherwise (if yn is  ``n''
       or  if no -Q option is specified), nothing is added.  Uses
       the directory dir to find the files specified by key:  the
       m4  macro  processing  command  (m), the predefined macros
       file (d), or both.  Causes objfile to be the name  of  the
       generated output object file.  If no -o is specified, then
       the output object file is created in the current directory
       with a name that depends on the specified input files.  If
       an input file with a name that ends with  ``.s''  is  pre-
       sent, the output file name is formed by replacing the suf-
       fix of the first such name  with  ``.o'';  otherwise,  the
       output  file is ``a.out''.  Specifies the target processor
       to be cpu, which may be ``486'' (the default), ``386'', or
       ``pentium''.   This option causes code generation specifi-
       cally tuned to the selected processor.

       Send, in order, ./cm4defs (if it exists)  and  mydefs  and
       sys/file.s  through  m4  with the macro K predefined to be
       ``7'', assemble the output of m4,  and  generate  the  ELF
       object  file  output  in  ./file.o:  as  -m -Yd,. -- -DK=7

       The m4 macro processor is not line-oriented and recognizes
       many  regular  identifiers as its keywords (index and len,
       for  example).   Thus,  preprocessing   compiler-generated
       assembly language with m4 requires care.

       Whenever possible, you should access the assembler through
       a compilation system interface program such as cc.

       This command has been updated to handle Intel Pentium  III
       Streaming SIMD instructions;  see for more information.
