       cof2elf  converts  one  or  more COFF object files to ELF.
       This translation occurs in  place,  meaning  the  original
       file  contents  are  modified.   If  an  input  file is an
       archive, each member will be translated as necessary,  and
       the archive will be rebuilt with its members in the origi-
       nal order.  cof2elf does not change input files  that  are
       not COFF.

       cof2elf  takes  the following options: Normally, files are
       modified only when full translation occurs.   Unrecognized
       data,  such  as  unknown  relocation types, are treated as
       errors and prevent translation.  If this option is  speci-
       fied, cof2elf ignores these partial translation conditions
       and modifies the file anyway.  Normally, cof2elf prints  a
       message  for  each  file  it examines, telling whether the
       file was translated, ignored,  and  so  on.   This  option
       causes cof2elf to suppress these messages (quiet).  If arg
       is y, identification information  about  cof2elf  will  be
       added  to  the output files.  This can be useful for soft-
       ware administration.  Giving n for arg explicitly asks for
       no  such  information,  which  is  the  default  behavior.
       cof2elf modifies the  input  files.   This  option  causes
       cof2elf to save a copy of the original files in the speci-
       fied directory, which must exist.  cof2elf does  not  save
       files that it does not modify.  Print a version message on
       standard error.

       Some debugging information is  discarded.   Although  this
       does  not affect the behavior of a running program, it may
       affect the information available for symbolic debugging.

       cof2elf translates only COFF relocatable files.   It  does
       not  translate  executable  or static shared library files
       for two main reasons.  First, the  operating  system  sup-
       ports executable files and static shared libraries, making
       translation unnecessary.  Second, those  files  have  spe-
       cific  address and alignment constraints determined by the
       file format.  Matching the constraints  with  a  different
       object file format is problematic.

       When  possible,  programmers should recompile their source
       code to build new object files.  cof2elf is  provided  for
       those times when source code is unavailable.
