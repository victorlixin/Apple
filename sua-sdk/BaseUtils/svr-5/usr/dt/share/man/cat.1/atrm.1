       atrm removes delayed-execution jobs that were created with
       the command, but not yet executed.  The list of these jobs
       and associated job numbers can be displayed by using

       arg a user name or job-number.  atrm removes each job-num-
       ber you specify, and/or all jobs belonging to the user you
       specify, provided that you own the indicated jobs.

       Jobs  belonging  to  other  users can only be removed by a
       privileged user.

       The atrm command can be used with the  following  options:
       All.   Remove all unexecuted jobs that were created by the
       current user.  If invoked by a privileged user, the entire
       queue  will be flushed.  Force.  All information regarding
       the removal of the specified jobs is suppressed.  Interac-
       tive.   atrm  asks  if  a  job  should be removed.  If you
       respond with a y, the job will be removed.
