       The  gcore  command creates a core image of each specified
       process.  This image can be used with  debuggers  such  as
       debug.   The  name  of the core image file for the process
       whose process ID is process-id will be core.process-id.

       The following options are available: Substitutes  file  in
       place  of  core  as the first part of the name of the core
       image files.  Substitutes procdir in place of /proc as the
       process file system.
