       saned  is  the  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) daemon that
       allows remote clients to access image acquisition  devices
       available on the local host.

       Do not install saned as setuid root without due considera-
       tion. When using dynamic linking, there is a potential for
       introducing  security  holes  when running this program as
       root.

       The contents of saned.conf is a list of  host  names  that
       are  permitted to use local SANE devices.  Empty lines and
       lines starting with a hash (#) are ignored.  A  line  con-
       taining the single character + is interpreted to match any
       hostname. This allows any remote machine to use your scan-
       ner  and  may  present  a security risk. It should be used
       with caution. A sample configuration file is shown  below:
       scan-client.somedomain.firm  # this is a comment localhost
       It is case-insensitive, so AHost.COM is considered identi-
       cal to ahost.com.

       For  saned to work properly, it is also necessary to add a
       configuration line to /etc/inetd.conf.  The  configuration
       line  normally  looks  like  this:  sane stream tcp nowait
       saned.saned /usr/local/sbin/saned saned However,  if  your
       system  uses  for  additional  security screening, you may
       want to disable saned  access  control  by  putting  +  in
       saned.conf  and  use  a  line  of  the  following  form in
       /etc/inetd.conf   instead:   sane   stream   tcp    nowait
       saned.saned  /usr/sbin/tcpd  saned Note that both examples
       assume that there is a saned group and a  saned  user.  If
       you follow this example, make sure that the access permis-
       sions on the special device are set such  that  saned  can
       access  the  scanner (the program generally needs read and
       write access to scanner devices).

       Finally, it is also necessary to add a line of the follow-
       ing  form  to  /etc/services: sane 6566/tcp # SANE network
       scanner daemon Note  that  port  number   6566   has   not
       been   officially  assigned   to the SANE network protocol
       and may change in the future.

       The SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies  the
       list  of  directories  that  may contain the configuration
       file. The directories are separated by a  colon  (:).   If
       this  variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file is
       searched in two default directories: firstly, the  current
       working  directory  (.) and then in /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If the value of the environment  variable  ends  with  the
       directory  separator  character, then the default directo-
       ries  are  searched   after   the   explicitly   specified

                                                                1

       directories.   For  example,  setting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to
       ``tmp/config:'' would result in directories tmp/config, .,
       and  /usr/local/etc/sane.d being searched (in this order).

       The -d flag requests that saned  run  in  debug  mode  (as
       opposed to mode). In this mode, saned explicitly waits for
       a  connection  request.  When  compiled   with   debugging
       enabled,  this flag may be followed by a number to request
       debug information. The larger the number, the more verbose
       the  debug output.  For example, -d128 will request print-
       ing of all debug information.

       local SANE devices.

       This  file  imposes  serious security risks and its use is
       not recommended.  Contains a list of  hosts  permitted  to
