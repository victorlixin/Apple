       The yacc command converts a context-free  grammar  into  a
       set  of tables for a simple automaton that executes a Look
       Ahead Left-to-Right (LALR  (1))  parsing  algorithm.   The
       grammar  may  be ambiguous; specified precedence rules are
       used to break ambiguities.  yacc  processes  supplementary
       code  set  characters in program comments and strings, and
       single-byte supplementary code set characters  in  tokens,
       according to the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environ-
       ment variable (see LANG on

       The output file, y.tab.c, must be compiled by the  C  com-
       piler  to produce a program yyparse.  This program must be
       loaded with the lexical analyzer program, yylex,  as  well
       as  main  and  yyerror,  an error handling routine.  These
       routines must be supplied by the user; the command is use-
       ful  for  creating lexical analyzers usable by yacc.  Pre-
       pares the file y.output, which contains a  description  of
       the  parsing tables and a report on conflicts generated by
       ambiguities in the grammar.   Change  to  use  file_prefix
       instead  of  y  as  the  prefix  for the output filenames.
       Causes extern "C" { ... } to surround the C++ only  decla-
       rations  of  the  functions  yyerror,  yylex, and yyparse.
       Generates the file y.tab.h  with  the  #define  statements
       that  associate the yacc-assigned ``token codes'' with the
       user-declared ``token names.''   This  association  allows
       source files other than y.tab.c to access the token codes.
       Specifies that the code produced in y.tab.c will not  con-
       tain  any  #line  constructs.   This option should only be
       used after the grammar  and  the  associated  actions  are
       fully  debugged.   Supplies  the path name of an alternate
       parser prototype.  Change to use sym_prefix instead of  yy
       as  the  prefix  for  the external linkage names.  The -Qy
       option puts the version stamping information  in  y.tab.c.
       This  allows  you  to  know what version of yacc built the
       file.  The -Qn option  (the  default)  writes  no  version
       information.   Compiles runtime debugging code by default.
       Runtime debugging code  is  always  generated  in  y.tab.c
       under  conditional  compilation control.  By default, this
       code is not included when y.tab.c is compiled.  Whether or
       not  the  -t option is used, the runtime debugging code is
       under the control of YYDEBUG, a preprocessor  symbol.   If
       YYDEBUG  has  a non-zero value, then the debugging code is
       included.  If its value is zero, then the code will not be
       included.   The  size and execution time of a program pro-
       duced without the runtime debugging code will  be  smaller
       and  slightly faster.  Prints on the standard error output
       the version information for yacc.  Generates writable yacc
       tables.  These tables are read-only by default.

       The  number of reduce-reduce and shift-reduce conflicts is
       reported on the standard error  output;  a  more  detailed
       report  is found in the y.output file.  Similarly, if some
       rules are  not  reachable  from  the  start  symbol,  this
       instance is also reported.

       Because  file  names  are  fixed, at most one yacc process
       without -b or with the same -b prefix can be active  in  a
       given directory at a given time.
