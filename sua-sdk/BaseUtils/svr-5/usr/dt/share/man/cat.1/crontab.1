       The crontab command copies the specified file, or standard
       input if no file is specified, into a directory that holds
       all users' crontab files.

       The  following  options are available: Edits a copy of the
       user's crontab file, or creates an empty file to  edit  if
       one  does  not exist.  If the editor exits with a non-zero
       status, the existing crontab file is left unchanged.  When
       editing  is  complete, the file is installed as the user's
       crontab file.  The crontab command determines which editor
       to invoke based on environment variables.  When the POSIX2
       environment variable is set, crontab  invokes  the  editor
       specified  by  the EDITOR environment variable.  If EDITOR
       is null (or not set), it invokes When POSIX2 is  not  set,
       crontab  invokes  the editor specified by the VISUAL envi-
       ronment variable, and if that is null, it invokes the edi-
       tor  specified  by the EDITOR environment variable, and if
       that is null, it invokes Lists the  user's  crontab  file.
       Removes the user's crontab from the crontab directory.

       Only  a privileged user can use username following the -e,
       -l, or -r options, to edit, list, or  remove  the  crontab
       file of the specified user.

       Users  can  use  crontab if their names appear in the file
       /etc/cron.d/cron.allow.  If that file does not exist,  the
       file  /etc/cron.d/cron.deny is checked to determine if the
       user should be denied access to crontab.  If neither  file
       exists,  only  root  can submit a job.  If cron.allow does
       not exist and cron.deny exists but is empty, global  usage
       is  permitted.   The  allow  and deny files consist of one
       user name per line.

       A crontab file consists of lines of six fields each.   The
       fields  are  separated  by spaces or tabs.  The first five
       are integer patterns that specify  the  following:  minute
       (0-59)  hour  (0-23)  day of the month (1-31) month of the
       year (1-12) day of the week (0-6 with  0=Sunday)  Each  of
       these  patterns  may  be  either an asterisk  (meaning all
       valid values) or a list of elements separated  by  commas.
       An  element is either a number or two numbers separated by
       a dash (identifying an inclusive range).   Note  that  the

                                                                1

crontab(1)                                             crontab(1)

       specification  of  days  may be made by two fields (day of
       the month and day of the week).  If both are specified  as
       a list of elements, both are adhered to.  For example, 0 0
       1,15 * 1 runs a command on the first and fifteenth of each
       month,  as  well  as  on every Monday.  To specify days by
       only one field, the other field should be set  to  *  (for
       example, 0 0 * * 1 runs a command only on Mondays).

       The  sixth  field  of a line in a crontab file is a string
       that is executed by the shell at the times  specified.   A
       percent  character  in this field (unless escaped by \) is
       translated to a newline character.  Only  the  first  line
       (up  to  a  % or end of line) of the command field is exe-
       cuted by the shell.  The other lines are made available to
       the command as standard input.

       Any line beginning with a # is a comment and is ignored.

       The shell specified in the /etc/passwd file for your login
       is used as long as its  name  ends  in  "/sh";  otherwise,
       /usr/bin/sh is used.

       The shell is invoked from your HOME directory with an arg0
       of sh.  Users who want to  have  their  .profile  executed
       must  explicitly do so in the crontab file.  cron supplies
       a default environment for every shell, defining HOME, LOG-
       NAME,                 SHELL(=/bin/sh),                 and
       PATH(=:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/lbin).

       If you do not redirect the standard  output  and  standard
       error  of your commands, any generated output or errors is
       mailed to you.

       If you inadvertently enter the  crontab  command  with  no
       arguments, exit using the  key.  Do not exit with a -d; if
       you do, then all entries in  your  crontab  file  will  be
       removed.

       If a privileged user modifies another user's crontab file,
       resulting behavior may  be  unpredictable.   Instead,  the
       privileged  user  should  first  to the other user's login
       before making changes to the crontab file.
