       In  the  first two forms, paste concatenates corresponding
       lines of the given input files file1, file2,  and  so  on.
       It  treats each file as a column or columns of a table and
       pastes them together horizontally (parallel merging).   If
       you will, it is the counterpart of which concatenates ver-
       tically, that is, one file after the other.  In  the  last
       form  above,  paste replaces the function of an older com-
       mand with the same name by combining subsequent  lines  of
       the input file (serial merging).  If more than one file is
       specified with the  -s  option,  concatenates  the  merged
       files  one below the other.  In all cases, lines are glued
       together with the tab character, or with  characters  from
       an  optionally  specified list.  Output is to the standard
       output, so it can be used as the start of a pipe, or as  a
       filter,  if - is used in place of a file name.  paste pro-
       cesses supplementary code set  characters  in  files,  and
       recognizes  supplementary  code set characters in the list
       given to the -d option (see below) according to the locale
       specified  in  the LC_CTYPE environment variable [see LANG
       on

       A - may be used in place of any file name to read  a  line
       from the standard input.  (There is no prompting.)

       The  meanings of the options are: Without this option, the
       new-line characters of each but the  last  file  (or  last
       line in case of the -s option) are replaced by a tab char-
       acter.  This option allows replacing the tab character  by
       one or more alternate characters (see below).  One or more
       characters immediately following -d  replace  the  default
       tab as the line concatenation character.  The list is used
       sequentially and circularly: first, the first  element  on
       the  list is used to concatenate the lines, then the next,
       and so on; when all elements have been used, the  list  is
       reused starting from the first element.  In parallel merg-
       ing (that is, no -s option), the lines from the last  file
       are  always terminated with a new-line character, not from
       the  list.   The  list  may  contain  the  special  escape
       sequences: \n (new-line), \t (tab), \\ (backslash), and \0
       (empty string, not a null character).  Quoting may be nec-
       essary,  if  characters  have special meaning to the shell
       (for example, to get one backslash, use -d\\\\).  list may
       contain  supplementary  code set characters.  Merge subse-
       quent lines rather than one from each input file.  Use tab
       for  concatenation,  unless  a  list  is specified with -d
       option.  Regardless of the list, the very  last  character

                                                                1
