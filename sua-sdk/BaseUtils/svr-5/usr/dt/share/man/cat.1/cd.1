       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the shell.  See for  more  informa-
       tion on this shell.

       If  directory is not specified, the value of shell parame-
       ter $HOME is used as the new working directory.  If direc-
       tory  specifies a complete path starting with /, ., or ..,
       directory becomes the new working directory.   If  neither
       case  applies,  cd  tries to find the designated directory
       relative to one of the  paths  specified  by  the  $CDPATH
       shell variable.  $CDPATH has the same syntax as, and simi-
       lar semantics to, the $PATH shell variable.  cd must  have
       execute (search) permission in directory.

       Because  a new process is created to execute each command,
       cd would be ineffective if it were  written  as  a  normal
       command; therefore, it is recognized by and is internal to
       the shell.
