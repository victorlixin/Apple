       iconv  converts  the characters or sequences of characters
       in file from one  code  set  to  another  and  writes  the
       results to standard output.  If no conversion exists for a
       particular character, the character is  converted  to  the
       underscore (_) in the target code set.

       Your system must have the appropriate data files for iconv
       to work.  The Language Supplement package provides a large
       selection of these data files.

       The  required  arguments  fromcode and tocode identify the
       input and output code  sets,  respectively.   If  no  file
       argument is specified on the command line, iconv reads the
       standard input.

       The optional argument mode provides a further  distinction
       between  mappings.  While all the modes are not all avail-
       able for all the conversions, the following values of mode
       are  defined:  Any character that cannot be represented is
       mapped to _.  Characters are mapped to the closest approx-
       imation  without  expansion, that is, all mappings are one
       to one.  Characters are mapped to the  closest  approxima-
       tion of that character in the target code set.  Where nec-
       essary, a character is expanded to a sequence  of  charac-
       ters.   If  there is a non-destructive space, overstriking
       may be used to display characters.

       When the Language Supplement package is installed on  your
       system,  the  following command line converts the contents
       of file mail1 from code set 8859 to 646fr and  stores  the
       results  in file mail.local.  iconv -f 8859 -t 646fr mail1
