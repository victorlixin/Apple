       tapecntl sends the optional commands to  the  tape  device
       driver  sub-device  /dev/rmt/ntape*.   Error  messages are
       written to standard error.  device is the tape device, and
       defaults to /dev/rmt/ntape1 if not specified.

       Not  all  options are supported by all tape devices or all
       tape device drivers.

       tapecntl takes the  following  options:  Read  compression
       characteristics.   Position  the  tape  to the end of data
       (EOD) mark.  This option  is  valid  only  for  SCSI  tape
       devices.   Read  block  length limits from the tape device
       and display them.  Set compression characteristics where n
       is:
       -----------------------------------------
       value of n   compression   decompression
       -----------------------------------------
       0            off           off
       1            on            off
       2            off           on
       3            on            on
       This  option only works with SCSI drives that support data
       compression and decompression.  Erase the tape.  The erase
       bar  is  activated while moving the tape from beginning to
       end, erasing all data tracks in a  single  pass  over  the
       tape.   Load  the  tape media and position the tape at the
       beginning of tape (BOT) mark.  Reset the tape device, ini-
       tializing  the  tape  controller registers and positioning
       the tape at the beginning of tape (BOT)  mark.   Retension
       the  tape, moving the tape from beginning to end and back,
       thereby repacking the tape with the proper tension  across
       its  length.   Unload the tape media from the tape device.
       Depending on the device, unloading  may  include  ejecting
       the  cartridge.   Set  the  tape  device to read and write
       variable length blocks.  This option works only on devices
       that  support  variable  length  blocks.  Rewind the tape,
       moving the tape to the BOT mark.   Set  the  tape  density
       where  n  is  the  numeric  density code as defined in the
       SCSI-2 specification.  This option works  only  with  SCSI
       drives.   The number specified must be in decimal.  Common
       density codes include: the default value for  the  device,
       meaning autodetect QIC-11 QIC-24; QIC-120 QIC-150

       Zero  is the recommended value.  For DAT devices, 0 and 13
       both denote the DDS format and are the only valid  density
       codes.   Set  the  tape  device to read and write in fixed
       length blocks of n bytes.
        Individual devices  have  specific  limitations  and  you

                                                                1

       should set this parameter only to a value supported by the
       device.  Position tape past the end of file (EOF) mark  n,
       where  n is an integer, positive or negative, representing
       the number of EOF marks to move forward  or  backward.   A
       positive  integer  moves  the tape forward relative to its
       current position, to a point just after the specified  EOF
       mark.   A  negative integer moves the tape backward in the
       same manner, to a point on the tape just before the speci-
       fied  EOF mark.  So, for example, using -p 2 will move the
       tape to the beginning of the third  record;  using  -p  -1
       will  move  the  tape  back  past  the previous file mark,
       putting the tape at the end of the record.  For this  rea-
       son,  backward positioning cannot move to the beginning of
       a  record,  and  because  backward  positioning  is  slow,
       rewinding  and  moving forward to the needed record is the
       recommended approach.  Backward positioning is not  avail-
       able  on  all  devices.   A  positioning  value of zero is
       ignored.  Illegal or out-of-range values  will  leave  the
       tape  positioned  at the last valid EOF mark.  Options can
       be used individually or strung together.

       The default mode for I/O from any magnetic tape,  such  as
       QICtape,  9-track, or DAT is fixed-length blocks which are
       512 bytes long.

       Exit codes for tapecntl and their meanings are as follows:
       Device function could not initiate properly due to miscon-
       nected  cables  or poorly inserted tape cartridge.  Device
       function failed to complete properly due to  unrecoverable
       error  condition,  either  in  the command setup or due to
       mechanical failure.  Device function  failed  due  to  the
       cartridge  being write protected or to the lack of written
       data   on   the   tape.    Device    /dev/rmt/ntape*    or
       /dev/rmt/ctape*  failed  to  open  properly due to already
       being opened or claimed by another process.

       Using variable-length block  mode  when  writing  magnetic
       tapes  is discouraged because it may not work correctly in
       releases before SVR4.2 MP. Magnetic tape should always  be
       written  in  fixed-length  block mode, even though you are
       free to change the default  fixed-block  length  from  512

                                                                2
