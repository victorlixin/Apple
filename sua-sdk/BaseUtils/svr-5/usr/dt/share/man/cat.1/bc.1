       bc  is an interactive processor for a language that resem-
       bles C but provides unlimited  precision  arithmetic.   It
       takes  input from any files given, then reads the standard
       input.  bc is actually a preprocessor for the desk  calcu-
       lator  program  dc,  which it invokes automatically unless
       the -c option is present.  In this case the  dc  input  is
       sent  to  the standard output instead.  The options are as
       follows: Compile only.  The output is sent to the standard
       output.  Argument stands for the name of an arbitrary pre-
       cision math library.

       The syntax for bc programs is as follows: L  means  letter
       a-z,  E  means expression, S means statement.  enclosed in
       /* and */ L L [E] the words ibase, obase, and scale  arbi-
       trarily  long numbers with optional sign and decimal point
       ( E ) sqrt ( E ) length ( E )   number of significant dec-
       imal  digits  scale  (E) number of digits right of decimal
       point L ( E , . . . , E ) +   -   *   /   %   ^     (%  is
       remainder;  ^  is  power)  ++    --   (prefix and postfix;
       apply to names) ==   <=   >=   !=   <   > =   =+   =-   =*
       =/  =%    =^  E { S ; . . . ; S } if ( E ) S while ( E ) S
       for ( E ; E ; E ) S null statement break quit define L ( L
       ,  .  . . , L ) {      auto L , . . . , L      S ; . . . S
            return ( E ) } sine cosine exponential log arctangent
       Bessel function

       All  function arguments are passed by value.  The value of
       a statement that is an expression is  printed  unless  the
       main operator is an assignment.  Either semicolons or new-
       lines may separate statements.  Assignment to scale influ-
       ences  the  number  of digits to be retained on arithmetic
       operations in the manner of dc.  Assignments to  ibase  or
       obase  set the input and output number radix respectively.

       The same letter may be used as an array, a function, and a
       simple  variable simultaneously.  All variables are global
       to the program.  auto variables  are  pushed  down  during
       function  calls.   When using arrays as function arguments
       or defining them  as  automatic  variables,  empty  square
       brackets must follow the array name.

       The bc command does not recognize the logical operators &&
       and ||.

       The for statement must have all three expressions (E's).

       The quit statement is interpreted when read, not when exe-
       cuted.

       For certain operations, the value of scale might be calcu-
       lated to be larger than the current specified scale value.
       When  you  set  scale  to  a  large  value, take this into
       account when performing operations that could overflow the
       specified scale value.
