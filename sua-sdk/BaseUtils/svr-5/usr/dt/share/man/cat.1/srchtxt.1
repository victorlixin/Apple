       The  srchtxt  utility  is  used  to  display  all the text
       strings in message data bases, or to  search  for  a  text
       string  in  message  data  bases (see These data bases are
       files in the directory  /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES
       (see  unless a file name given with the -m option contains
       a /.  The directory locale can be viewed as  the  name  of
       the  language  in  which the text strings are written.  If
       the -l option is not specified, the files accessed will be
       determined  by  the  value  of  the  environment  variable
       LC_MESSAGES.   If  LC_MESSAGES  is  not  set,  the   files
       accessed  will  be determined by the value of the environ-
       ment variable  LANG.   If  LANG  is  not  set,  the  files
       accessed      will      be      in      the      directory
       /usr/lib/locale/C/LC_MESSAGES,  which   contains   default
       strings.

       If  no text argument is present, then all the text strings
       in the files accessed will be displayed.

       The meanings of  the  options  are  as  follows:  suppress
       printing  of  the message sequence numbers of the messages
       being   displayed   access   files   in   the    directory
       /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES.  If -m msgfile is also
       supplied, locale is ignored for msgfiles containing  a  /.
       access file(s) specified by one or more msgfiles.  If msg-
       file contains a / character, then msgfile  is  interpreted
       as  a pathname; otherwise, it will be assumed to be in the
       directory determined as described above.  To specify  more
       than  one  msgfile,  separate the file names using commas.
       search for the text string specified by text  and  display
       each  one that matches.  text can take the form of a regu-
       lar expression (see

       If the -s option is not specified, the displayed  text  is
       prefixed   by   message  sequence  numbers.   The  message
       sequence numbers are enclosed  in  angle  brackets:  <msg-
       file:msgnum>.   name  of the file where the displayed text
       occurred sequence number in msgfile  where  the  displayed
       text occurred

       The  error messages produced by srchtxt are intended to be
       self-explanatory.  They indicate an error in  the  command
       line  or errors encountered while searching for a particu-
       lar locale and/or message file.

       The following examples show uses of srchtxt.

       Example 1:
       If message files have been installed  in  a  locale  named
       french  by  using then you could display the entire set of
       text      strings      in      the      french      locale
       (/usr/lib/locale/french/LC_MESSAGES/*)  by typing: srchtxt
       -l french

       Example 2:
       If a set of error messages associated with the   operating
       system  have  been  installed in the file UX in the french
       locale   (/usr/lib/locale/french/LC_MESSAGES/UX),    then,
       using the value of the LANG environment variable to deter-
       mine the locale to be searched, you could search that file
       in  that  locale for all error messages dealing with files
       by typing: LANG=french; export LANG
       srchtxt -m UX "[Ff]ichier"

       If  /usr/lib/locale/french/LC_MESSAGES/UX  contained   the
       following  strings:  Erreur  E/S\n  Liste d'arguments trop
       longue\n Fichier inexistant\n Argument invalide\n Trop  de
       fichiers  ouverts\n  Fichier  trop  long\n Trop de liens\n
       Argument  hors  du  domaine\n   Identificateur   supprim\n
       Etreinte fatale\n
         .
         .
         .

       then   the   following   strings   would   be   displayed:
       <UX:3>Fichier   inexistant\n   <UX:5>Trop   de    fichiers
       ouverts\n <UX:6>Fichier trop long\n

       Example 3:
       If  a set of error messages associated with the  operating
       system have been installed in the file UX  and  a  set  of
       error messages associated with the INGRESS data base prod-
       uct have been installed in the file ingress, both  in  the
       german  locale,  then  you  could  search  for the pattern
       [Dd]atei in both the files UX and ingress  in  the  german
       locale   by   typing:  srchtxt  -l  german  -m  UX,ingress
       "[Dd]atei"
