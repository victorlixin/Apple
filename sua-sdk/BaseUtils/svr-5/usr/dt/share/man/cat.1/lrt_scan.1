       lrt_scan [-l] object log [log] . . .

       lrt_scan  analyzes a set of flow-profile logs to determine
       the best order for the functions of object for locality of
       text  reference.  lrt_scan writes to the standard output a
       list of the functions of the object (only those  that  are
       actually  used)  ordered such that functions that are usu-
       ally called within a short time of each other  are  placed
       within a short distance in the object.

       The output of this command is used as input to

       The  -l option requests that lrt_scan take as long as nec-
       essary to find the best ordering possible.  This may  take
       a very long time and is only recommended for ``overnight''
       computations.

       lrt_scan is successful if every log is a  valid  flow-pro-
       file log and object is referenced in one of them.
