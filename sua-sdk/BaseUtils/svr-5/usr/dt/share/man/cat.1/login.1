       login  is  an  identification and authentication mechanism
       that is invoked by a port monitor,  typically  ttymon,  at
       the  beginning  of  each  terminal session.  It provides a
       means of identifying users to the system and  authenticat-
       ing  user  identity.  As the last step in the login proce-
       dure, a service, usually sh, is invoked.

       login cannot be invoked from  a  shell.   Instead,  it  is
       placed in a port monitor's administrative file by the sys-
       tem administrator and is invoked by the port monitor, typ-
       ically ttymon.  (See and

       When  login  is  invoked  by  the  port  monitor, a prompt
       appears.  The minimum response is  a  login  name.   Other
       possible options and parameters are outlined below.

       If  appropriate, login may ask for a password.  Where pos-
       sible, echoing is turned off while the password  is  typed
       so  the  password does not appear on the written record of
       the session.  If the -p option has  been  included,  login
       invokes  the  passwd command.  (See If the LOGIN_ONLY key-
       word is set in the password default file, this use of  the
       -p option is the only way a user can change passwords.

       At  some  installations,  you  may  be required to enter a
       dialup password for dialup connections, as well as a login
       password.   In  this case, the prompt for the dialup pass-
       word will be ``Dialup Password:''.

       If you do not complete the  login  successfully  within  a
       certain  period of time (see you are likely to be silently
       disconnected.

       The following arguments and  options  may  be  entered  in
       response  to  the  login  prompt.   The user's login name.
       Changes the user's password.  The system prompts  for  the
       old password and a new password, and then asks for the new
       password again as a check  against  typing  errors.   Sets
       environment variable(s).

       The     basic     environment     is    initialized    to:
       HOME=your_login_directory          LOGNAME=your_login_name
       MAIL=/var/mail/your_login_name               PATH=/usr/bin
       SHELL=last_field_of_passwd_entry # (/bin/sh if  the  field
       is empty) TZ=timezone_specification The environment may be
       expanded or modified  by  supplying  additional  arguments
       when  login  prints the prompt requesting the user's login
       name.  The arguments may take either of two forms: xxx  or
       xxx=yyy.   Arguments  without  an equal sign are placed in
       the environment as Ln=xxx where n is a number that  starts

                                                                1

       at  0  and is incremented each time a new variable name is
       required.  Variables containing = are placed in the  envi-
       ronment  without  modification.   If  such  a  variable is
       already defined, the new value replaces the old value.  To
       prevent  users who log in to restricted shell environments
       from spawning secondary shells that  are  not  restricted,
       the  following  environment  variables  cannot be changed:
       HOME IFS LOGNAME PATH SHELL login understands simple, sin-
       gle-character  quoting conventions.  Typing a backslash in
       front of a character quotes it and allows the inclusion of
       such characters as spaces and tabs.

       If  the  authentication performed by the login authentica-
       tion scheme, /usr/lib/iaf/login/scheme, is successful, the
       scheme  pushes  the  following  information onto a STREAMS
       module and returns control to the port monitor:  AUDITMASK
       GID  GIDCNT  (group count) HOME HZ LOGNAME PATH SGID (sup-
       plementary group list) SHELL TTY TZ UID  ULIMIT  The  port
       monitor  then  calls  set_id  and  set_env, which use this
       information to set the user's identity and environment.

       After a successful login, accounting  files  are  updated,
       the  time you last logged in is printed, and (if appropri-
       ate) your current level is printed.

       printed if the user name or the password cannot be matched
       or if the user's login account  has  expired  or  remained
       inactive for a period greater than the system threshold.
