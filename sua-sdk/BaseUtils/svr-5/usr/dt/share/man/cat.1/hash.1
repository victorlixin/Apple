       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the shell.  See for  more  informa-
       tion on this shell.

       The  hash  command affects the way the current shell envi-
       ronment remembers the  locations  of  utilities  (see  the
       ``Execution''  section  of the manual page).  Depending on
       the arguments specified, it adds utility locations to  its
       list  of remembered locations or it purges the contents of
       the list.  When no arguments are specified, it reports  on
       the contents of the list.  Utilities provided as built-ins
       to the shell are not reported.

       If the -r option is  specified,  the  list  of  remembered
       locations for the current shell environment is emptied.

       The utility operand specifies the name of a utility (with-
       out slashes) to be searched for and added to the  list  of
       remembered locations.

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of hash: Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
       tion  variables  that are unset or null.  If LANG is unset
       or null, the corresponding value from the  implementation-
       specific  default  locale  will  be  used.   If any of the
       internationalization variables contains  an  invalid  set-
       ting,  the utility will behave as if none of the variables
       had been defined.  If set to  a  non-empty  string  value,
       override  the values of all the other internationalization
       variables.  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
       sequences  of  bytes of text data as characters (for exam-
       ple, single- as opposed to multi-byte characters in  argu-
       ments).   Determine  the  locale  that  should  be used to
       affect the format  and  contents  of  diagnostic  messages
       written to standard error.  Used to determine the location
       of utility.

   OOuuttppuutt
       The standard output of hash is used when no arguments  are
       specified.   It  includes  the pathname of each utility in
       the list of remembered locations  for  the  current  shell
       environment.   This list consists of those utilities named
       in previous hash invocations that have been invoked.

                                                                1

       An exit code of 0 indicates successful completion; an exit
       code greater than 0 indicates an error.

UUssaaggee
       Since  hash  affects  the current shell execution environ-
       ment, if it is called  in  a  separate  utility  execution
       environment,  such  as one of the following: nohup hash -r
       find . -type f | xargs hash it will not affect the command
       search process of the caller's environment.

       The  hash  command  is implemented as an alias: alias -t -
       The effects of hash -r can also be achieved  by  resetting
       the value of PATH, such as in: PATH="$PATH"
