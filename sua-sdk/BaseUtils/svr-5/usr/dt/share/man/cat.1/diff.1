       diff tells what lines must be  changed  in  two  files  to
       bring  them into agreement.  (It does not use the locale's
       collation in the comparison.)  If filename1 (filename2) is
       -,  the  standard input is used.  The LC_CTYPE environment
       variable defines the codesets used in the  filenames.   If
       filename1  (filename2) is a directory, then a file in that
       directory with the name  filename2  (filename1)  is  used.
       The  normal output contains lines of these forms: n1an3,n4
       n1,n2dn3 n1,n2cn3,n4

       These lines resemble commands to  convert  filename1  into
       filename2.  The numbers after the letters pertain to file-
       name2.  In fact, by exchanging a for d and  reading  back-
       ward  one  may  ascertain equally how to convert filename2
       into filename1.  As in ed, identical pairs, where n1 =  n2
       or n3 = n4, are abbreviated as a single number.

       Following  each of these lines come all the lines that are
       affected in the first file flagged  by  <,  then  all  the
       lines  that  are affected in the second file flagged by >.
       Ignores trailing blanks (spaces and tabs) and treats other
       strings of blanks as equivalent.  The LC_CTYPE environment
       variable determines what characters are treated as blanks.
       (See and LANG on Ignores the case of letters; for example,
       A will be treated as equal to  a.   This  option  is  also
       influenced by the locale value in the LC_CTYPE environment
       variable.  Expands TAB characters in output lines.  Normal
       or  -c  output adds character(s) to the front of each line
       that may adversely affect the indentation of the  original
       source lines and make the output lines difficult to inter-
       pret.  This option will  preserve  the  original  source's
       indentation.  The LC_CTYPE environment variable is used in
       correctly formatting the  data,  and  so  must  specify  a
       locale that defines the same codesets as used in the input
       data.  Ignores all blanks ( and TAB characters) and treats
       all  other  strings  of blanks as equivalent; for example,
       if ( a == b ) will compare equal to if(a==b).

       The following options are mutually exclusive:  Produces  a
       listing  of differences with three lines of context.  With
       this option output format  is  modified  slightly:  output
       begins with identification of the files involved and their
       creation dates, then each change is separated  by  a  line

                                                                1

       with  a dozen *s.  The dates are in the format that output
       from date "+%a %b %e %T %Y" produces. This is affected  by
       the  LC_TIME  environment  variable.  (see and LANG on The
       lines removed from filename1 are marked with  '--';  those
       added to filename2 are marked '+'.  Lines that are changed
       from one file to the other are marked in both  files  with
       '!'.   Produces a listing of differences identical to that
       produced by -c with number lines of context.  The form  of
       number is affected by the LC_NUMERIC environment variable.
       (see and LANG on Produces a script of a, c, and d commands
       for  the  editor  ed,  which  will recreate filename2 from
       filename1.  In connection with  -e,  the  following  shell
       program  may  help  maintain  multiple versions of a file.
       Only an ancestral file ($1) and a chain of version-to-ver-
       sion ed scripts ($2,$3, ...) made by diff need be on hand.
       A ``latest version'' appears on the standard output.

        (shift; cat $*; echo '1,$p') | ed - $1

       Except in rare circumstances, diff finds a smallest suffi-
       cient set of file differences.  Produces a similar script,
       not useful with ed, in the opposite order.  Does  a  fast,
       half-hearted  job.   It  works only when changed stretches
       are short and well separated, but does work  on  files  of
       unlimited  length.  Options -e and -f are unavailable with
       -h.  Produces a script similar to -e, but in the  opposite
       order  and with a count of changed lines on each insert or
       delete command.  Creates a merged version of filename1 and
       filename2  with C preprocessor controls included so that a
       compilation of  the  result  without  defining  string  is
       equivalent  to  compiling filename1, while defining string
       will yield filename2.

       The following options are used for comparing  directories:
       Produce output in long format.  Before the diff, each text
       file is piped through to paginate it.   Other  differences
       are  remembered and summarized after all text file differ-
       ences are reported.  Applies diff  recursively  to  common
       subdirectories  encountered.  Reports files that are iden-
       tical; these would not otherwise be mentioned.   Starts  a
       directory  diff  in  the  middle,  beginning with the file
       name.
