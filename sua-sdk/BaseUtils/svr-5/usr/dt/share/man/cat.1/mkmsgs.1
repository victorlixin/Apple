       The  mkmsgs  utility  is  used  to  create  a file of text
       strings that can be  accessed  using  the  text  retrieval
       tools  (see  and  It  will  take  as  input a file of text
       strings for a particular geographic locale (see and create
       a  file  of text strings in a format that can be retrieved
       by and By using the -i option, you can install the created
       file  under  the /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES direc-
       tory (locale corresponds to the language in which the text
       strings  are written).  the name of the file that contains
       the original text strings.  the name of  the  output  file
       where  mkmsgs writes the strings in a format that is read-
       able by and The name of msgfile can be up to 14 characters
       in length, but may not contain either ``\0'' (null) or the
       ASCII code for / (slash) or : (colon).  install msgfile in
       the  /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_MESSAGES directory.  Only a
       privileged user or a member of group  bin  can  create  or
       overwrite  files  in  this  directory.   Directories under
       /usr/lib/locale will be created  if  they  do  not  exist.
       overwrite  msgfile, if it exists.  The input file contains
       a set  of  text  strings  for  the  particular  geographic
       locale.   Text  strings are separated by a newline charac-
       ter.  Nongraphic characters must be represented as  alpha-
       betic  escape  sequences.   Messages  are  transformed and
       copied sequentially from inputstrings to msgfile.  To gen-
       erate  an empty message in msgfile, leave an empty line at
       the correct place in inputstrings.

       Single-line and multi-line comments can be included in the
       file.   Single-line comments are designated by the charac-
       ters %# as the first two characters of the  comment  line:
       message  1 %# This is a  comment message 2 Multi-line com-
       ments are designated by the characters %{ at the beginning
       of the first comment line, and are terminated by the char-
       acters %} at the beginning of a line  (with  no  following
       text):  message  1  %{  This is a comment %} message 2 or:
       message 1 %{ This is a comment %} message 2 The space fol-
       lowing the comment-opening characters is optional.

       Strings  can  be changed simply by editing the file input-
       strings.  New strings must be added only at the end of the
       file;  then  a  new  msgfile  file  must  be  created  and
       installed in the correct place.  If this procedure is  not
       followed,  the  retrieval function will retrieve the wrong
       string and software compatibility will be broken.

       The following example shows an input message  source  file
       C.str:  File  %s:\t cannot be opened\n %s: Bad directory\n

       from  C.str  to  create  text  strings  in the appropriate

       C.str UX The following command uses the input strings from
       FR.str to create text strings in the appropriate format in
       the       file       UX       in       the       directory
       /usr/lib/locale/french/LC_MESSAGES/UX:  mkmsgs  -i  french
       FR.str  UX These text strings would be accessed if you had
       set the environment variable LC_MESSAGES to ``french'' and
       then invoked one of the text retrieval tools listed at the
       beginning of the ``Description'' section.
