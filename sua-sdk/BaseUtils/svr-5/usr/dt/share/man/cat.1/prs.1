       prs prints, on the standard output, parts  or  all  of  an
       SCCS  file (see in a user-supplied format.  If a directory
       is named, prs prints the files in that  directory,  except
       the  non-SCCS  files (last component of the path name does
       not begin with s.)  and unreadable files.  If a name of  -
       is  given,  the  standard  input is read; each line of the
       standard input is taken to be the name of an SCCS file  or
       directory  to be processed.  prs silently ignores non-SCCS
       files and unreadable files.

       Arguments to prs, which may appear in any  order,  consist
       of keyletter arguments and file names.

       The  keyletter arguments apply independently to each named
       file:  Specifies  the  output  data  specification.    The
       dataspec is a string consisting of SCCS file data keywords
       (see the  ``Data  Keywords''  section)  interspersed  with
       optional user-supplied text.  Specifies the SCCS identifi-
       cation (SID) string of a delta for  which  information  is
       desired.  The default is the top delta.  Requests informa-
       tion for all deltas created earlier than and including the
       delta designated via the -r keyletter or the date given by
       the -c option.  Requests information for all  deltas  cre-
       ated later than and including the delta designated via the
       -r keyletter or the date given by the -c option.  The cut-
       off date-time in the form: YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]

       Units  omitted from the date-time default to their maximum
       possible values; for  example,  -c7502  is  equivalent  to
       -c750228235959.   Any number of non-numeric characters may
       separate the fields  of  the  cutoff  date;  for  example,
       -c77/2/2  9:22:25.   Requests  printing of information for
       both removed, that is, delta type = R, [see and  existing,
       that  is,  delta type = D, deltas.  If the -a keyletter is
       not specified, information for  existing  deltas  only  is
       provided.

       Data keywords specify those parts of an SCCS file that are
       to be retrieved and output.  All parts  of  an  SCCS  file
       [see  have  an associated data keyword.  There is no limit
       on the number of times a data  keyword  may  appear  in  a
       dataspec.

       The  information printed by prs consists of: (1) the user-
       supplied text; and (2) appropriate values (extracted  from
       the SCCS file) substituted for the recognized data
       keywords  in the order of appearance in the dataspec.  The
       format of a data keyword value is either  ``Simple''  (S),

                                                                1

       in which keyword substitution is direct, or ``Multi-line''
       (M), in which keyword substitution is followed by pressing
       .

       User-supplied  text is any text other than recognized data
       keywords.  A tab is specified by \t and RETURN/new-line is
       specified   by   \n.    The  default  data  keywords  are:
