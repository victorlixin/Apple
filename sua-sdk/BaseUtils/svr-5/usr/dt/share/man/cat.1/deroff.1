       deroff reads each of the files in sequence and removes all
       requests, macro calls,  backslash  constructs,  constructs
       (between  .EQ  and .EN lines, and between delimiters), and
       descriptions, perhaps  replacing  them  with  white  space
       (blanks  and blank lines), and writes the remainder of the
       file on the standard output.   deroff  follows  chains  of
       included files (.so and .nx troff commands); if a file has
       already been included, a .so naming that file  is  ignored
       and  a  .nx  naming that file terminates execution.  If no
       input file is given, deroff reads the standard input.

   OOppttiioonnss
       Output a word list, one word  per  line,  with  all  other
       characters  deleted.   Otherwise,  the  output follows the
       original, with the deletions mentioned above.  In text,  a
       word  is any string that contains at least two letters and
       is composed of letters, digits, ampersands (&), and  apos-
       trophes  (<'>).   In  a  macro  call, however, a word is a
       string that begins with at least two letters and  contains
       a  total  of  at  least three letters.  Delimiters are any
       characters other than letters,  digits,  apostrophes,  and
       ampersands.    Trailing  apostrophes  and  ampersands  are
       removed  from  words.   Interpret  macros  as  mm  macros.
       Interpret  macros  as  ms  macros.  Interpret macros as mm
       macros and delete lists.  Ignore the  troff  requests  .so
       and .nx.

       deroff  is  not a complete troff interpreter, so it can be
       confused by subtle constructs.  Most such errors result in
       too much rather than too little output.

       The -ml option does not handle nested lists correctly.
