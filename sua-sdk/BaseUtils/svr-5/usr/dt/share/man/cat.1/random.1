       random  generates  a random number on the standard output,
       and returns the number as its  exit  value.   By  default,
       this  number  is either 0 or 1.  If scale is given a value
       between 1 and 255, then the range of the random  value  is
       from  0  to scale.  If scale is greater than 255, an error
       message is printed.

       When the -s (silent) option is given, then the random num-
       ber  is  returned  as an exit value, but is not printed on
       the standard output.  If an error occurs,  random  returns
       an exit value of zero.

       This  command does not perform any floating point computa-
       tions.  random uses the time of day as a seed.
