       chgrp changes the group ID of the files given as arguments
       to group.  The group may be either a decimal group ID or a
       group name found in the group ID file, /etc/group.

       You  must  be  the  owner of the file, or have appropriate
       privilege to use this command.

       The  operating   system   has   a   configuration   option
       (_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED),  to restrict ownership changes.
       When this option is in effect, the owner of the  file  may
       change  the group of the file only to a group to which the
       owner belongs.  Only a  privileged  user  can  arbitrarily
       change  owner IDs whether this option is in effect or not.

       chgrp has two options: Recursive.  chgrp descends  through
       the  directory, and any subdirectories, setting the speci-
       fied group ID as it proceeds.   When  symbolic  links  are
       encountered,  they  are  traversed.  If the file is a sym-
       bolic link, change the group of the symbolic link.   With-
       out  this  option, the group of the file referenced by the
       symbolic link is changed.

       The LC_CTYPE environment variable determines the  codesets
       used in the arguments (see LANG on
