       The  first  form  of the lp command arranges for the named
       files and associated information  (collectively  called  a
       request) to be printed.  If filenames are not specified on
       the command line, the  standard  input  is  assumed.   The
       standard  input may be specified along with named files on
       the command line by listing the filenames and specifying -
       for  the standard input.  The files will be printed in the
       order in which they appear on the command line.   lp  pro-
       cesses  supplementary code set characters according to the
       locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment variable (see
       LANG on except as noted under the -t option below.

       The  LP  print service associates a unique request-ID with
       each request and displays it on the standard output.  This
       request-ID  can be used later when canceling or changing a
       request, or when determining its status.  See the  section
       on  cancel  for details about canceling a request, and for
       information about checking the status of a print  request.

       The  second form of lp is used to change the options for a
       request submitted previously.  The print  request  identi-
       fied  by the request-ID is changed according to the print-
       options specified with this  command.   The  print-options
       available are the same as those with the first form of the
       lp command.  If the request  has  finished  printing,  the
       change  is  rejected.  If the request is already printing,
       it will  be  stopped  and  restarted  from  the  beginning
       (unless the -P option has been given).

       If  the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed and run-
       ning, each printer has a Mandatory  Access  Control  level
       range associated with it and can accept print jobs only if
       the security level of the job falls within  the  printer's
       level  range.  If a print job fails because of level range
       restrictions, the job will be canceled, and  you  will  be
       notified  by  mail.  In that case, you will need to submit
       the job to a different printer (one with  the  appropriate
       security  level range).  Ask your system administrator for
       information on printer security level ranges.

       For printers configured to use the  B2  interface,  unless
       you  use the -o nolabels option, all paginated output will
       have a single line of security level  information  printed
       at  the  top  and bottom of each page of the output.  (The

                                                                1

       security level name is truncated if it is longer than  one
       line.)   In addition, the banner and trailer pages for the
       print job will contain complete  security  level  informa-
       tion.

       The  cancel  command allows users to cancel print requests
       previously sent with the lp command.  The  first  form  of
       cancel  permits  cancellation  of  requests based on their
       request-ID.  The second form of cancel  permits  cancella-
       tion of requests based on the login-ID of their owner.

       The  first  form of the lp command is used to send a print
       request either to a particular printer or to  any  printer
       capable  of meeting all requirements of the print request.

       Options to lp must always precede filenames,  but  may  be
       specified  in any order.  The following options are avail-
       able for lp: Make copies of the files to be printed  imme-
       diately  when  lp  is invoked.  Normally files will not be
       copied, but will be linked whenever possible.  If  the  -c
       option is not specified, the user should be careful not to
       remove any of  the  files  before  the  request  has  been
       printed  in its entirety.  It should also be noted that if
       the -c option is not specified, any changes  made  to  the
       named  files  after  the  request is made but before it is
       printed will be reflected in the printed  output.   In  an
       enhanced security environment the administrator is able to
       configure the LP print service  to  always  have  lp  copy
       files.   Choose  dest  as the printer or class of printers
       that is to do the printing.  If dest is  a  printer,  then
       the request will be printed only on that specific printer.
       If dest is a class of printers, then the request  will  be
       printed on the first available printer that is a member of
       the class.  If dest is  any,  then  the  request  will  be
       printed  on any printer that can handle it.  Under certain
       conditions (unavailability of printers, file space limita-
       tions,  and  so on) requests for specific destinations may
       not be accepted (see By default, dest is  taken  from  the
       environment  variable  LPDEST.  If LPDEST is not set, then
       dest is taken from the environment variable  PRINTER.   If
       PRINTER  is not set, a default destination (if one exists)
       for the computer system is used.  If no system default  is
       set  and -T is used, dest will be selected on the basis of
       content-type  specified  with  the  -T  option  [see   the
       description  of  -T].  Destination names vary between sys-
       tems (see Print the request on the form form-name.  The LP
       print  service  ensures  that  the  form is mounted on the
       printer.  If form-name is requested with a printer  desti-
       nation  that  cannot  support  the  form,  the  request is
       rejected.  If form-name has not been defined for the  sys-
       tem,  or  if  the user is not allowed to use the form, the
       request is rejected.  (see  When  the  -d  any  option  is
       given,  the request is printed on any printer that has the

       requested form mounted and can handle all other  needs  of
       the  print  request.   Print  the request according to the
       value of special-handling.  Acceptable values for special-
       handling are defined below: Do not print the request until
       notified.  If printing has already begun, stop it.   Other
       print requests will go ahead of a held request until it is
       resumed.  If the Auditing Utilities are installed, the use
       of  this  option  is  an  auditable  event.  Resume a held
       request.  If it had been printing when held,  it  will  be
       the next request printed, unless subsequently bumped by an
       immediate  request.   If  the   Auditing   Utilities   are
       installed,  the  use of this option is an auditable event.
       The -i option (followed by  a  request-ID)  must  be  used
       whenever  this  argument is specified.  (Available only to
       LP administrators) Print the request next.  If  more  than
       one request is assigned immediate, the most recent request
       will be printed first.  If another  request  is  currently
       printing,  it  must be put on hold to allow this immediate
       request to print.  Specify locale-name as  the  locale  to
       use  with  this print request.  By default, locale-name is
       set to the value of LC_CTYPE.  If  LC_CTYPE  is  not  set,
       locale-name  defaults  to  the  C  locale.  Send mail (see
       after the files have been printed.  By  default,  mail  is
       not  sent  upon  normal  completion  of the print request.
       Print number copies of the output.   The  default  is  one
       copy.   Specify  printer-dependent  options.  Several such
       options may be collected by specifying  the  -o  keyletter
       more  than  once  (that  is,  -o option1 -o option2 ... -o
       optionn), or by specifying a list of options with  one  -o
       keyletter  enclosed  in  double  quotes  and  separated by
       spaces (that is, -o "option1 option2 Do not print a banner
       page  with  this  request.  The administrator can disallow
       this option at any time.  This option is not supported  by
       printers  configured  to  use  the  B2  interface.  Do not
       insert a form feed between the files given, if  submitting
       a  job  to  print  more than one file.  This option is not
       supported  by  printers   configured   to   use   the   PS
       (PostScript)  interface.   Do  not  print  security  level
       information at the top and bottom of each page of the out-
       put.   If the Auditing Utilities are installed, the use of
       this option is an auditable event.   This  option  is  not
       supported by printers configured to use the standard or PS
       (PostScript) interface.  Print  this  request  with  pages
       scaled-decimal-number long.  A scaled-decimal-number is an
       optionally scaled decimal number  that  gives  a  size  in
       lines, characters, inches, or centimeters, as appropriate.
       The scale is indicated  by  appending  the  letter  i  for
       inches,  or  the  letter c for centimeters.  For length or
       width settings, an  unscaled  number  indicates  lines  or
       characters; for line pitch or character pitch settings, an
       unscaled number indicates lines per inch or characters per
       inch  (the  same as a number scaled with i).  For example,
       length=66 indicates a page length of 66 lines,  length=11i
       indicates  a  page  length of 11 inches, and length=27.94c

                                                                3

       indicates a page length of 27.94 centimeters.  This option
       may not be used with the -f option and is not supported by
       the PS (PostScript) or B2 interface.  Print  this  request
       with  pages scaled-decimal-number wide.  (See the explana-
       tion  of  scaled-decimal-numbers  in  the  discussion   of
       length,  above.)   This option may not be used with the -f
       option and is not supported by the PS (PostScript)  or  B2
       interface.   Print this request with the line pitch set to
       scaled-decimal-number.  (See the  explanation  of  scaled-
       decimal-numbers in the discussion of length, above.)  This
       option may not be used with the -f option and is not  sup-
       ported by the PS (PostScript) or B2 interface.  Print this
       request with the character pitch set to pica (representing
       10 characters per inch), elite (representing 12 characters
       per inch), or compressed (representing as many  characters
       per  inch  as a printer can handle).  There is not a stan-
       dard number of characters per inch for all  printers;  see
       the  database  for  the  default  character pitch for your
       printer.  This option may not be used with the  -f  option
       and  is  not supported by the PS (PostScript) or B2 inter-
       face.  A list of  options  valid  for  the  stty  command;
       enclose the list with single quotes if it contains blanks.
       Print the pages specified in page-list.  This  option  can
       be  used only if there is a filter available to handle it;
       otherwise, the print request will be rejected.  The  page-
       list  may  consist  of ranges of numbers, single page num-
       bers, or a combination of both.  The pages will be printed
       in ascending order.  Assign this request priority-level in
       the printing queue.  The values  of  priority-level  range
       from  0  (highest priority) to 39 (lowest priority).  If a
       priority is not specified, the default for the print  ser-
       vice  is used, as assigned by the system administrator.  A
       priority limit may be assigned to individual users by  the
       system  administrator.   If  the  Auditing  Utilities  are
       installed, the use of this option is an  auditable  event.
       Remove  file(s)  after  submitting  the print request. Use
       this option with caution.  See  ``-T  content-type  [-r]''
       below.  Suppress the ``request id is ...'' message.  Print
       this request using the specified character-set  or  print-
       wheel.   If a form was requested and it requires a charac-
       ter set or print wheel other than the one  specified  with
       the -S option, the request is rejected.

       For  printers  that  take print wheels: if the print wheel
       specified is  not  one  listed  by  the  administrator  as
       acceptable  for the printer specified in this request, the
       request is rejected unless  the  print  wheel  is  already
       mounted on the printer.

       For printers that use selectable or programmable character
       sets: if the character-set specified is not one defined in
       the  Terminfo  database  for the printer (see or is not an
       alias  defined  by  the  administrator,  the  request   is
       rejected.

lp(1)                                                       lp(1)

       When  the -d any option is used, the request is printed on
       any printer that  has  the  print  wheel  mounted  or  any
       printer  that  can  select the character set, and that can
       handle all other needs of the request.  Print title on the
       banner  page  of  the  output.   The  default is no title.
       Enclose title in quotes if it contains blanks.  Supplemen-
       tary  code  set  characters  specified  in  title  are not
       printed correctly (see Print the request on a printer that
       can  support  the  specified  content-type.  If no printer
       accepts this type directly, a filter will be used to  con-
       vert  the  content  into  an  acceptable  type.  If the -r
       option is specified, a filter will not be used.  If -r  is
       specified   but   no   printer  accepts  the  content-type
       directly, the request is rejected.  If the content-type is
       not  acceptable  to any printer, either directly or with a
       filter, the request is rejected.

       In addition to ensuring that no filters will be used,  the
       -r   option   will   force   the   equivalent  of  the  -o
       'stty=-opost' option.  Write a message on the user's  ter-
       minal  after  the files have been printed.  If the user is
       not logged in, or if the printer resides on a remote  sys-
       tem,  then  mail  will  be  sent instead.  If the Enhanced
       Security Utilities are installed and running on  the  sys-
       tem,  this  option will not be available to administrative
       users (that is, to users at SYS_PRIVATE).  Be  aware  that
       messages  may  be  sent  to a window other than the one in
       which the command  was  originally  entered.   Print  this
       request  according  to  the printing modes listed in mode-
       list.   The  allowed  values  for  mode-list  are  locally
       defined.   This option may be used only if there is a fil-
       ter available to handle it; otherwise, the  print  request
       will be rejected.

       The   following  list  describes  the  mode-list  options:
       Reverse the order in which pages are printed.  This filter
       option  is  not supported by the LP Print Service.  Change

       The  cancel  command  cancels requests for print jobs made
       with the lp command.  The first  form  allows  a  user  to
       specify  one  or more request-IDs of print jobs to be can-
       celed.  Alternatively, the user can specify  one  or  more
       printers, on which only the currently printing job will be
       canceled if it is the user's job.

                                                                5

lp(1)                                                       lp(1)

       The second form of cancel cancels all jobs for users spec-
       ified  in login-IDs.  In this form the printers option can
       be used to restrict the printers on which the users'  jobs
       will be canceled.  Note that in this form, when the print-
       ers option is used, all jobs queued by the users for those
       printers will be canceled.  A printer class is not a valid
       argument.

       A user without special privileges can cancel only requests
       that  are  associated with his or her own login ID; if the
       Enhanced Security Utilities are installed, a request  must
       have  a  Mandatory Access Control (MAC) level equal to the
       user's current level.  To cancel a request, a user  issues
       the  command:  cancel  -u  login-ID [printer] This command
       cancels all print requests associated with the login-ID of
       the  user  making  the request, either on all printers (by
       default) or on the printer specified.

       If a user submits a print job, logs out, and then logs  in
       at  a  different  MAC  level, the user will not be able to
       cancel the print job.

       Administrative users with the appropriate  privileges  can
       cancel jobs submitted by any user by issuing the following
       types of commands: Cancels all requests (on  all  relevant
       printers)  by  the  specified  users, including those jobs
       currently being  printed.   Double  quotes  must  be  used
       around  login-ID-list  if  the  list contains blanks.  The
       argument login-ID-list may include any or all of the  fol-
       lowing  constructs:  a  user on the local system a user on
       system system-name all users on system system-name a  user
       on  all systems all users on the local system all users on
       all systems Note that a remote job can be canceled only if
       it originated on the client system; that is, a server sys-
       tem can cancel jobs that came from a client, and a  client
       system can cancel jobs it sent to a server.

       The  exception to this is when the bsd printer protocol is
       being used and the client has been marked  as  ``trusted''
       in /etc/lp/Systems. This allows the root user on a trusted
       client to cancel requests originating with other  clients.
       See  for  more  information.  printer-2 printer-n" Cancels
       all requests by the  specified  users  for  the  specified
       printers,  including  those  jobs currently being printed.
       (For a complete list of printers available on your system,
       execute  the  lpstat  -p command.)  In any of these cases,
       the cancellation of a request that is  currently  printing
       frees the printer to print the next request.

       If  the  Auditing Utilities are installed, the use of this
       command is an auditable event.

       printers  if  the  application generates PostScript output
       that uses them.  Filtering of output  does  not  automati-
       cally  occur  when the printer accepts the content type of
       the request (specified by the -T  option)  directly.   For
       Postscript  requests  with content type PS, downloading of
       fonts will not take place.  Use content type postscript or
       post  if  automatic  font downloading is required.  The lp

       Printers for which requests are not being accepted will
       not be considered when the destination is any.  (Use the
       lpstat -a command to see which printers are accepting
       requests.)  However, if a request is destined for a class
       of printers and the class itself is accepting requests,
       then all printers in the class will be considered, regard-
       less of their acceptance status.

       For printers that take mountable print wheels or font car-
       tridges, if you do not specify a particular print wheel or
       font with the -S option, whichever one happens to be
       mounted at the time your request is printed will be used.
       The lpstat -p printer -l command is used to see which
       print wheels are available on a particular printer.  The
       lpstat -S -l command is used to see what print wheels are
       available and on which printers.  Without the -S option,
       the standard character set is used for printers that have
       selectable character sets.

       If you experience problems with jobs that usually print
       but on occasion do not print, check the physical connec-
       tions between the printer and your computer.  If you are
       using an automatic data switch or an A/B switch, try
       removing it and see if the problem clears.

       Earlier versions of the (R) system may issue warnings
       about unrecognized options (such as the locale= or flist=
       options), when processing print requests from remote sys-
       tems running a more recent version of the LP Print Server.
       The request will be printed normally, however.

       Administrators with appropriate privileges can suppress
       these warnings by adding the following two lines to the
       section annotated as ``adding simple options,'' in the
       printer interface program used by the printer issuing the
       warnings.  locale=*) ;; flist=*) ;; (Printer interface
       programs are found in the /usr/lib/lp/model directory.)

                                                                7

lp(1)                                                       lp(1)

       An example of how to do this can be found in the standard
       interface program.
