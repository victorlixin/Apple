       sdiff  uses  the  output  of the diff command to produce a
       side-by-side listing of two files  indicating  lines  that
       are  different.  Lines of the two files are printed with a
       blank gutter between them if the lines are identical, a  <
       in  the  gutter  if the line appears only in file1, a > in
       the gutter if the line appears only in file2, and a |  for
       lines  that  are different.  For example:      x    |    y
            a         a      b    <      c    <       d         d
                 >    c  sdiff  processes  supplementary code set
       characters in files according to the locale  specified  in
       the LC_CTYPE environment variable (see LANG on

       Valid  options are: Use the argument n as the width of the
       output line.  The default  line  length  is  130  columns.
       Print  only the left side of any lines that are identical.
       Do not print identical lines.  Use the argument output  as
       the  name  of  a third file that is created as a user-con-
       trolled merge of file1  and  file2.   Identical  lines  of
       file1  and  file2  are  copied to output.  Sets of differ-
       ences, as produced by diff, are printed; where  a  set  of
       differences share a common gutter character.  After print-
       ing each set of differences, sdiff prompts the user with a
       %  and waits for one of the following user-typed commands:
       Append the left column to the  output  file.   Append  the
       right  column to the output file.  Turn on silent mode; do
       not print identical lines.  Turn off  silent  mode.   Call
       the editor with the left column.  Call the editor with the
       right column.  Call the editor with the  concatenation  of
       left  and right.  Call the editor with a zero length file.
       Exit from the program.

       On exit from the editor, the resulting  file  is  concate-
       nated to the end of the output file.
