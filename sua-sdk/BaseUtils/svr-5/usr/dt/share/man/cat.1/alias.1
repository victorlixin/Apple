       This shell script executes the builtin command of the same
       name as implemented by the  /u95/bin/sh  shell.   See  for
       more information on this shell.

       The  alias  command creates or redefines alias definitions
       or writes the values  of  existing  alias  definitions  to
       standard  output.   An  alias definition provides a string
       value that replaces a command name when it is encountered.
       The  unalias  command  removes  alias definitions from the
       current shell environment.

       An alias definition affects the  current  shell  execution
       environment  and  the  execution  environments of the sub-
       shells of the current shell.  The  alias  definition  will
       not affect the parent process of the current shell nor any
       utility environment invoked by the shell.

       See the manual page for a description of alias  processing
       and the shell execution environment.

       The  -a  option  to  the unalias command removes all alias
       definitions from the current shell.

       If no operands are given to the alias command,  all  alias
       definitions in the current execution environment are writ-
       ten to the standard output.

       The following operands are supported: Specifies an  exist-
       ing  alias  name in the current shell's execution environ-
       ment.

       When one or more alias-names are used with the alias  com-
       mand,  the given alias definitions are written to standard
       output.  Using one or more alias-names  with  the  unalias
       command removes the given aliases from the current shell's
       execution environment.  This operand to the alias  command
       creates a new alias definition in the current shell's exe-
       cution environment by assigning the value of string to the
       alias alias-name.

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of alias and unalias: Provide  a  default  value  for  the
       internationalization variables that are unset or null.  If

                                                                1

       LANG is unset or null, the corresponding  value  from  the
       implementation-specific  default  locale will be used.  If
       any of  the  internationalization  variables  contains  an
       invalid setting, the utility will behave as if none of the
       variables had been defined.  If set to a non-empty  string
       value, override the values of all the other international-
       ization variables.  Determine the locale for the interpre-
       tation  of  sequences  of bytes of text data as characters
       (for example, single- as opposed to multi-byte  characters
       in  arguments).   Determine the locale that should be used
       to affect the format and contents of  diagnostic  messages
       written to standard error.

       The alias command writes alias definitions one per line to
       standard output in the format: name=value The value string
       is written with appropriate quoting so that it is suitable
       for reinput to the shell.  See the  description  of  shell
       quoting in

       Standard error is used only for diagnostic messages.

       An  exit  value  of  0 indicates successful completion.  A
       value greater than 0 indicates that one of the  alias-name
       operands  specified  did  not have an alias definition, or
       that some other error occurred.
