       unget undoes the effect of a get -e done prior to creating
       the intended new delta.  If a directory  is  named,  unget
       behaves  as  though each file in the directory were speci-
       fied as a named  file,  except  that  non-SCCS  files  and
       unreadable  files are silently ignored.  If a name of - is
       given, the standard input is read  with  each  line  being
       taken as the name of an SCCS file to be processed.

       Keyletter  arguments  apply  independently  to  each named
       file.   Uniquely  identifies  which  delta  is  no  longer
       intended.   (This  would have been specified by get as the
       ``new delta'').  The use of this  keyletter  is  necessary
       only  if  two  or more outstanding gets for editing on the
       same SCCS file were done by the same person (login  name).
       A diagnostic results if the specified SID is ambiguous, or
       if it is necessary and omitted on the command line.   Sup-
       presses  the  printout,  on  the  standard  output, of the
       intended delta's SID.  Causes the retention of the  gotten
       file,  which  would  normally  be removed from the current
       directory.

       unget must be performed by the same user who performed the
       original get -e.
