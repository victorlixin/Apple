       ckrange  prompts  a  user  and validates the response.  It
       defines,  among  other  things,  a  prompt  message  whose
       response should be an integer in the range specified, text
       for help and error messages, and a default value (which is
       returned if the user responds with a ).

       This  command  also  defines  a range for valid input.  If
       either the lower or upper limit is  left  undefined,  then
       the range is bounded on only one end.

       All  messages  are  limited in length to 70 characters and
       are formatted automatically.  Any white space used in  the
       definition (including newline) is stripped.  The -W option
       cancels the automatic formatting.  When a tilde is  placed
       at  the  beginning  or  end  of  a message definition, the
       default text is inserted at that point, allowing both cus-
       tom text and the default text to be displayed.

       If  the  prompt, help or error message is not defined, the
       default message (as defined  under  ``Notices'')  is  dis-
       played.

       Three  visual  tool modules are linked to the ckrange com-
       mand.  They are errange (which  formats  and  displays  an
       error  message),  helprange  (which formats and displays a
       help message), and valrange (which validates a  response).
       These  modules  should  be  used  in conjunction with FMLI
       objects.  In this instance, the FMLI  object  defines  the
       prompt.

       The  options  and  arguments  for this command are: Do not
       allow quit as a valid response.  Use  width  as  the  line
       length  for  prompt,  help, and error messages.  The lower
       limit of the range is lower.   Default  is  the  machine's
       largest  negative integer or long.  The upper limit of the
       range is upper.  Default is the machine's largest positive
       integer  or  long.  The base for input is base.  Must be 2
       to 36, default is 10.  The default value is default.   The
       default  is not validated and so does not have to meet any
       criteria.  If default is non-numeric,  ckrange  returns  0

                                                                1

       and  not the alphabetic string.  The help message is help.
       The error message is error.  The prompt message is prompt.
       Send process ID pid a signal if the user chooses to abort.
       When quit is chosen, send signal to the process whose  pid
       is specified by the -k option.  If no signal is specified,
       use SIGTERM.  Input to be verified against upper and lower
       limits and base.

       The default base 10 prompt for ckrange is: Enter an  inte-
       ger between lower and upper [lower-upper,q,?]  The default
       base 10 error message is: ERROR - Please enter an  integer
       between lower and upper.  The default base 10 help message
       is: Please enter an integer between lower and upper.   The
       messages  are changed from integer to base base integer if
       the base is set to a number other than 10.

       When the  quit  option  is  chosen  (and  allowed),  q  is
       returned  along with the return code 3.  The valrange mod-
       ule does not produce any output.  It returns zero for suc-
       cess and non-zero for failure.
