       The tsaunix program implements the Storage Management Ser-
       vices (SMS) Target Service Agent (TSA) API on  a  &gemini;
       machine  for  the  purposes of backing up mounted filesys-
       tems. When the program receives a connection request  from
       a  SMS  backup/restore engine on a NetWare server, it will
       spawn a tsaunix process to perform the  actual  backup  or
       restore.  tsaunix does not cross mount points and does not
       traverse the symbolic links while backing up. It does  not
       backup the remote filesystems (for example, ).

       The  local  filesystems  are the primary resources and the
       directory on which a filesystem is mounted is shown as the
       resource.  The  leading ``/'' in the mount point directory
       is shown as ROOT: on the backup engine.

       The user can specify the scan  control  options  from  the
       engine  to customize how to scan the directories and files
       to back up. One of the scan control  options  specific  to
       is ``Exclude device special files.'' This option is set to
       ``no'' by default which  means  that  the  device  special
       files are backed up in default case.

       The  user  can  choose the selection list for filesystems,
       directories and files for backup and restore.  The  selec-
       tion  list  is  specified  on the backup engine and is the
       include/exclude  list  for  filesystems,  directories  and
       files.

       A  default  exclusion list (paths that by default will not
       be backed up) is created from the /etc/Ignore file on  the
       &gemini;   system,   removing   any   paths  mentioned  in
       /etc/Backup.

       The default  exclusion  list  takes  precedence  over  the
       selection list sent by the backup engine.

       The backup data is encoded in System Independent Data For-
       mat (SIDF).

       Error    messages,    if    any,    are     written     to
       /var/adm/unixtsa.log.

       Language-specific  message  file  (see  LANG on the manual
       page).  Paths that should not be  backed  up  by  default.
       Paths that should be backed up even if they are implied by
       entries in /etc/Ignore. tsaunix  uses this  file  only  to
       eliminate  the  entries  common  to  both  /etc/Backup and
       /etc/Ignore from the default exclusion list.
