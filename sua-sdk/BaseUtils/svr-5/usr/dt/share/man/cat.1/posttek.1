       The  posttek  filter  translates  tektronix  4014 graphics
       files into PostScript and writes the results on the  stan-
       dard output.  If no files are specified, or if - is one of
       the input files, the standard input is read.  The  follow-
       ing options are understood: Print num copies of each page.
       By default, only one copy is printed.   Print  text  using
       font  name.  Any PostScript font can be used, although the
       best results will be obtained  only  with  constant  width
       fonts.  The default font is Courier.  Magnify each logical
       page by the factor num.  Pages are scaled uniformly  about
       the  origin which, by default, is located at the center of
       each page.  The default magnification is 1.0.   Print  num
       logical pages on each piece of paper, where num can be any
       positive integer.  By default, num is  set  to  1.   Print
       pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated list.
       The list contains single numbers N and ranges N1 - N2.   A
       missing  N1  means  the lowest numbered page, a missing N2
       means the highest.  Print  files  in  either  portrait  or
       landscape  mode.  Only the first character of mode is sig-
       nificant.  The default mode is landscape.   Set  the  line
       width  used  for  graphics to num points, where a point is
       approximately 1/72 of an inch.  By default, num is set  to
       0 points, which forces lines to be one pixel wide.  Trans-
       late the origin num inches along the positive x axis.  The
       default coordinate system has the origin fixed at the cen-
       ter of the page, with positive x to the right and positive
       y  up the page.  Positive num moves everything right.  The
       default offset is 0.0 inches.  Translate  the  origin  num
       inches  along  the  positive  y  axis.  Positive num moves
       everything up the page.  The default offset is 0.0.

       An exit status of 0 is returned if files were successfully
       processed.

       The  default line width is too small for write-white print
       engines, such as the one used by the PS-2400.
