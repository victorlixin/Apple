       When  you  invoke  the vtlmgr command (usually from within
       your .profile), it places itself  in  the  background  and
       monitors  /dev/vtmon for signals from the keyboard/display
       driver to open new virtual terminals.

       Option: The -k option sends a SIGHUP signal  to  all  open
       virtual  terminals  when  you log off (by entering -d from
       your home virtual terminal).  This  automatically  closes,
       if possible, existing virtual terminals.  For virtual ter-
       minals  that  cannot  be  automatically  closed,  you  are
       prompted about closing them manually.

       After  running  vtlmgr, you open new virtual terminals and
       then switch between them by entering a  hot-key  sequence,
       specifically:
        key

       where  key  is  either  a function key whose number corre-
       sponds to the number of the virtual terminal to  which  to
       switch  or  a  letter  in  the  table below.  For example,
       pressing  switches you to /dev/vt01 (virtual terminal 01),
       pressing  switches you to /dev/vt02 (virtual terminal 02),
       and so on,

       _nn     next virtual terminal
       _pp     previous virtual terminal

       Use the f key only when the current  virtual  terminal  is
       locked  up  or  stuck  in  graphics mode.  Using the f key
       causes the virtual terminal to be reset  to  a  sane  text
       state  and  to kill all processes associated with the vir-
       tual terminal.  If X is running in the virtual terminal, X
       and  all  clients  will be terminated.  You can use the -f
       (force) key sequence to recover.  Typically  you  will  be
       switched  to the /dev/console virtual terminal where X may
       be restarted.

       When the hot-key sequence is entered, the executable  pro-
       gram  pointed to by the $SHELL variable is executed in the
       new virtual terminal.  If $SHELL is NULL or  points  to  a
       program  that is not executable, /bin/sh is executed.  The
       newly opened virtual terminal inherits the environment  in
       effect when the vtlmgr command is invoked.

       You  may  perform setup on each new virtual terminal as it
       is created by vtlmgr through the .vtlrc file in your  home

                                                                1

       directory.   This file contains a shell script that is run
       by /bin/sh before the shell prompt is displayed.  In  this
       way,  it  is  similar to your .profile file.  However, you
       may not set and export environment variables to the  shell
       for  the  virtual  terminal because a different shell runs
       the .vtlrc shell script.

       The system administrator can control how many virtual ter-
       minals  are  available  by setting a parameter in the file
       /etc/default/workstations.  Virtual terminals 0 through  8
       are  configured  by  default, and the default keyboard map
       makes up to 13 virtual terminals available  (that  is,  an
       additional  4  virtual  terminals  can  readily be defined
       within the default settings).  The default virtual  termi-
       nals  are  the home terminal and one corresponding to each
       function key.  An application can make two more  available
       to  the  end-user  (by reprogramming the keyboard map), or
       can reserve the last two for programmatic use only, making
       15 virtual terminals available in all.

       Note  that  processes that are no longer visible may still
       be continuing.  Standard output is directed to the current
       virtual  terminal's  screen.  For example, you can issue a
       cat command on one virtual  terminal,  switch  to  another
       virtual  terminal to start an application, and then switch
       to another to do an edit.  The cat output will be lost  if
       the  virtual  terminal  scrolls  the  data  off the screen
       unless you initially redirect the output to a file.

       The vtlmgr command fails under the  following  conditions:
       An  invalid  option  is  specified.   The device cannot be
       opened.  The command is invoked from  a  remote  terminal.
       /dev/vtmon  cannot  be  opened.   $SHELL is set and is not
       executable.  $SHELL is  not  set  and  /bin/sh  cannot  be
       invoked.
