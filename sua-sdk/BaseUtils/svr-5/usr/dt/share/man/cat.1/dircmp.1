       dircmp  examines dir1 and dir2 and generates various tabu-
       lated information about the contents of  the  directories.
       Listings  of  files  that are unique to each directory are
       generated for all the options.  If no option is entered, a
       list is output indicating whether the file names common to
       both directories have the same contents.  dircmp processes
       supplementary  code  set  characters in directory and file
       names according to the locale specified  in  the  LC_CTYPE
       environment variable (see LANG on

       During execution dircmp creates temporary files in TMPDIR.
       This variable defaults to /var/tmp if it is not set in the
       user's  environment,  or  if the path represented by it is
       not a valid directory.  If there is not  enough  space  in
       TMPDIR, whatever its definition, dircmp will fail.

       Compare  the  contents of files with the same name in both
       directories and output a list telling what must be changed
       in  the  two files to bring them into agreement.  The list
       format is described in Suppress messages  about  identical
       files.   Change the width of the output line to n columns.
       The default width is 72.
