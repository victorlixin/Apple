       The fmli command invokes the Form and Menu Language Inter-
       preter  and opens the frame(s) specified by the file argu-
       ment.  The file argument is the pathname  of  the  initial
       frame  definition file(s), and must follow the naming con-
       vention Menu.xxx, Form.xxx or Text.xxx for a menu, form or
       text frame respectively, where xxx is any string that con-
       forms  to   system  file  naming  conventions.   The  FMLI
       descriptor  lifetime will be ignored for all frames opened
       by argument to fmli.  These  frames  have  a  lifetime  of
       immortal by default.

       The  available options are as follows: If -a is specified,
       alias_file is the name of a file which contains  lines  of
       the form alias= pathname.  Thereafter, $ alias can be used
       in definition files to simplify references to  objects  or
       devices with lengthy pathnames, or to define a search path
       (similar to $PATH in the
        system shell).  If -c is specified, command_file  is  the
       name  of a file in which default FMLI commands can be dis-
       abled,  and  new  application-specific  commands  can   be
       defined.   The  contents  of command_file are reflected in
       the FMLI Command Menu.  If -i  is  specified,  initializa-
       tion_file  is  the  name  of a file in which the following
       characteristics of the application as a whole can be spec-
       ified:  A  transient introductory frame displaying product
       information A banner, its position, and other elements  of
       the  banner  line Color attributes for all elements of the
       screen Screen Labeled Keys (SLKs) and their layout on  the
       screen.

       When  this  variable  is  set  to  yes,  true, or the null
       string, it directs FMLI to download alternative  keystroke
       sequences  into the function keys of terminals that do not
       have fixed, preset values for them.  Can be used to  over-
       ride  the width of the logical screen defined for the ter-
       minal set in TERM.  For terminals with a 132-column  mode,
       for  example, invoking FMLI with the line COLUMNS=132 fmli
       frame-file will allow this wider screen width to be  used.
       Can  be  used to override the length of the logical screen
       defined for the terminal set in  TERM.   Can  be  used  to
       obtain  FMLI  messages in a certain language.  The default
       setting of LANG (LANG=C) makes  FMLI  output  messages  in
       English.

       To  invoke  fmli:  fmli  Menu.start where Menu.start is an
       example of file named according to the file  name  conven-
       tions for menu definition files explained above.

                                                                1

fmli(1)                                                   fmli(1)

       To  invoke  fmli  and name an initialization file: fmli -i
       init.myapp Menu.start where init.myapp is  an  example  of
       initialization_file.

       If  file is not supplied to the fmli command, fmli returns
       the message: Initial object must be specified.

       If file does not exist or is not readable, fmli returns an
       error  message  and exits.  The example command line above
       returns the following message and exits: Can't open object
       "Menu.start"

       If  file  exists, but does not start with one of the three
       correct object names (Menu., Form., or Text.)  or if it is
       named correctly but does not contain the proper data, fmli
       starts to build the  screen  by  putting  out  the  screen
       labels  for function keys, after which it flashes the mes-
       sage: I do not recognize that  kind  of  object  and  then
       exits.
