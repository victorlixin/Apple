       The  lpstat command displays information about the current
       status of the LP print service.  If no options are  given,
       lpstat  displays  the status of all print requests made by
       you.  (See for details.)  Status messages containing  sup-
       plementary  code set characters are displayed according to
       the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment  variable
       (see LANG on

       The  command lpstat -o printername is used to list all the
       requests queued on the specified printer.  If  printername
       points to a remote printer (see then lpstat -o printername
       lists all the requests on the  remote  printer,  not  just
       those submitted locally.

       Any  arguments  that  are  not  options  are assumed to be
       request-IDs as returned by lp.  The  lpstat  command  dis-
       plays the status of such requests.  The options may appear
       in any order and may be repeated and intermixed with other
       arguments.   Some  of the keyletters below may be followed
       by an optional list that can be in one  of  two  forms:  a
       list  of  items  separated  by  commas,  for  example,  -p
       printer1,printer2 a list of items separated by spaces  and
       enclosed in quotes, for example, -u "user1 user2 user3" If
       the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed and running,
       unprivileged   users   can  display  information  only  on
       requests that are dominated  by  the  users'  current  MAC
       level.  Specifying all after any keyletter that takes list
       as an argument causes  all  information  relevant  to  the
       keyletter  to  be  displayed.   For  example,  the command
       lpstat -a all lists the accepting status of all print des-
       tinations.

       The  omission  of  a list following such keyletters causes
       all information relevant to the keyletter to be displayed.
       For example, the command lpstat -a is equivalent to lpstat
       -a all. The exception to the behavior of the  all  keyword
       is  when  it  is  used  in conjunction with the -o option:
       lpstat -o all only lists  requests  submitted  locally  to
       remote printers.

       The  following  options  and  arguments  may  be used with
       lpstat: Report whether print  destinations  are  accepting
       requests.   list is a list of intermixed printer names and
       class names.  Report names of all classes and  their  mem-
       bers.   list  is  a  list of class names.  Report what the
       system default destination is (if any).  Verify  that  the
       forms  in  list  are  recognized  by the LP print service.
       list is a list of forms;  the  default  is  all.   The  -l
       option  will  list the form parameters.  Report the status
       of print requests.  list is a list of  intermixed  printer

                                                                1

       names, class names, and request-IDs.  The keyletter -o may
       be omitted.  The -l option lists for each request  whether
       it is queued for, assigned to, or being printed on a local
       printer, the form required (if any), and the character set
       or  print  wheel  required  (if  any).  Note that required
       forms (if any) are not listed for remote printers.  Report
       the status of printers, specifying which printers are cur-
       rently available.  (If the Enhanced Security Utilities are
       installed and running, you may not have access to printers
       that lpstat reports to  be  available;  whether  you  have
       access  to  ``available''  printers  is determined by your
       level and the level range of those printers.)  list  is  a
       list of printer names.  If the -D option is given, a brief
       description is printed for each printer in list.   If  the
       -l  option  is given, a full description of each printer's
       configuration is given, including the  form  mounted,  the
       acceptable  content  and printer types, a printer descrip-
       tion, the interface used, and so on.

       In order to maintain system security  access  information,
       the information needed to produce the printer status given
       by lpstat -p is available only if the LP scheduler is run-
       ning.   Report  the  status  of  the  LP request scheduler
       (whether it is running).  Report a number showing the rank
       order  of  jobs in the print queue for each printer.  Dis-
       play a status summary, including  the  status  of  the  LP
       scheduler, the system default destination, a list of class
       names and their members, a  list  of  printers  and  their
       associated  devices,  a  list of the systems sharing print
       services, a list of all forms and their availability,  and
       a  list of all recognized character sets and print wheels.
       The -l option displays all parameters for  each  form  and
       the  printer  name where each character set or print wheel
       is available.  Verify that the character sets or the print
       wheels  specified  in  list are recognized by the LP print
       service.  Items in list can be  character  sets  or  print
       wheels;  the default for list is all.  If the -l option is
       given, each line is appended by a list  of  printers  that
       can  handle  the  print  wheel or character set.  The list
       also shows whether the print wheel  or  character  set  is
       mounted or specifies the built-in character set into which
       it maps.  Display all status information: all the informa-
       tion  obtained with the -s option, plus the acceptance and
       idle/busy  status  of  all  printers  and  status  of  all
       requests.  The -l option displays more detail as described
       for the -f, -o, -p, and -s  options.   Supplementary  code
       set  characters specified are not printed correctly.  Dis-
       play the status of output requests for users.  The  login-
       ID-list  argument  may include any or all of the following
       constructs: a user on the local system a  user  on  system
       system-name  all users on system system-name a user on all
       systems all users on the local system  all  users  on  all
       systems The default value of login-ID-list is all.  Report
       the names of printers and the  pathnames  of  the  devices

                                                                2

       associated with them (for local printers) or remote system
       names (if the Network  Support  Utilities  is  installed).
       Administrative  users will also see the device level range
       of a remote printer.  list is a list of printer names.

       If you select this option for a network printer  then,  if
       possible, the specified printer range will be displayed by
       the security level aliases.  If a level  alias  cannot  be
       displayed,  then  the  fully  qualified level name will be
       displayed.  If the fully qualified level  name  cannot  be
       displayed,  then  the  appropriate level ID number will be
       displayed.  Display the alias name of the MAC level  asso-
       ciated  with  the  print  jobs; valid only if the Enhanced
       Security Utilities are installed and running.  Display the
       fully  qualified name of the MAC level associated with the
       print jobs; valid only if the Enhanced Security  Utilities
       are  installed  and  running.   The  -z and -Z options are
       mutually exclusive.  If the -z  option  is  specified  and
       there  is  not an alias assigned to the level, the decimal
       value of the level identifier (LID) is displayed.  If  the
       -z  or  -Z  option  is  specified  and the level is in the
       valid-inactive state, the decimal value of the LID is dis-
       played.  LID states are described in

       lpstat  reports  the status of all printers, regardless of
       the MAC level of the user issuing the command.  Therefore,
       the  fact  that a user may receive the status of a printer
       does not necessarily mean the printer will be available to
       that user.
