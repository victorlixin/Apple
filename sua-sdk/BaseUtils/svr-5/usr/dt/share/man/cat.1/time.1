       time [-p] command

       The  time command invokes the command named by the command
       operand  with  any  arguments  supplied  as  the  argument
       operands and writes a message to standard error that lists
       timing statistics for the execution of the command.

       The  message  includes  the  following  information:   The
       elapsed  (real) time between invocation of utility and its
       termination.  The User CPU time, equivalent to the sum  of
       the  tms_utime and tms_cutime fields returned by the func-
       tion for the process in which command  is  executed.   The
       System  CPU  time,  equivalent to the sum of the tms_stime
       and tms_cstime fields returned by  the  function  for  the
       process in which command is executed.

       The precision of the timing will be no less than the gran-
       ularity defined for the size of the clock tick unit on the
       system, but the results will be reported in terms of stan-
       dard time units (for example, 0.02  seconds,  00:00:00.02,
       1m33.75s, 365.21 seconds), not numbers of clock ticks.

       When  time  is  used  as  part  of  a  pipeline, the times
       reported are unspecified, except when  find  is  the  sole
       command  within  a grouping command [see in that pipeline.
       For example, the following two commands  are  unspecified:
       time  a  |  b | c a | b | time c The following two command
       lines report on utilities a and c, respectively: a |  b  |
       (time c) { time a } | b | c

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of time: Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
       tion  variables  that are unset or null.  If LANG is unset
       or null, the corresponding value from the  implementation-
       specific  default  locale  will  be  used.   If any of the
       internationalization variables contains  an  invalid  set-
       ting,  the utility will behave as if none of the variables
       had been defined.  If set to  a  non-empty  string  value,
       override  the values of all the other internationalization
       variables.  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
       sequences  of  bytes  of  text  data  as  characters  (for

       arguments).   Determine  the locale that should be used to
       affect the format and contents of diagnostic and  informa-
       tive  messages  written  to standard error.  Determine the
       locale for numeric formatting.  Determine the search  path
       that will be used to locate the utility to be invoked.

       The  standard  error  will  be  used  to  write the timing
       statistics.

       If -p is specified, the following  format  will  be  used:
       real    0m0.00s user    0m0.00s sys     0m0.00s where each
       floating-point number is expressed in seconds.

       If the command is invoked, the exit status of time is  the
       exit  status  of the 1command; otherwise, the time utility
       will exit with one of the following  values:  exit  values
       are  returned: An error occurred in the time utility.  The
       utility specified by command was found but  could  not  be
       invoked.   The  utility  specified by command could not be
       found.

       The command, env, nice, nohup, time, and  xargs  utilities
       have  been  specified  to  use  exit  code 127 if an error
       occurs so that applications can distinguish  ``failure  to
       find  a  utility''  from  ``invoked utility exited with an
       error indication''.  The value 127 was chosen  because  it
       is  not  commonly  used for other meanings; most utilities
       use small values for ``normal error conditions''  and  the
       values  above  128 can be confused with termination due to
       receipt of a signal.  The value 126 was chosen in a  simi-
       lar  manner  to  indicate that the utility could be found,
       but not invoked.

       Some scripts produce meaningful error messages differenti-
       ating the 126 and 127 cases.  The distinction between exit
       codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell practice that uses
       127  when  all  attempts  to  exec  the  utility fail with
       ENOENT, and uses 126 when any attempt to exec the  utility
       fails for any other reason.

       It  is  frequently desirable to apply time to pipelines or
       lists of commands.  This can be done by placing  pipelines
       and  command lists in a single file; this file can then be
       invoked as a utility, and the  time  statistics  apply  to
       everything in the file.

       Alternatively,  backquotes  (shell  metacharacters) can be
       used to apply time to a complex command: time sh -c  'com-
       plex-command-line'
