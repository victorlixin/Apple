       mailq  prints  a  summary  of the mail messages queued for
       future delivery.

       The first line printed for each message shows the internal
       identifier  used on this host for the message, the size of
       the message in bytes, the date and time  the  message  was
       accepted  into  the  queue, and the envelope sender of the
       message.  The second line shows  the  error  message  that
       caused  this message to be retained in the queue.  It will
       not be present if the message is being processed  for  the
       first time.  Subsequent lines show message recipients, one
       per line.

       mailq is identical to sendmail -bp.

       The options are as  follows:  Print  verbose  information.
       This adds the priority of the message and a single charac-
       ter indicator (``+'' or blank) showing whether  a  warning
       message  has  been  sent on the first line of the message.
       Additionally, extra  lines  may  be  intermixed  with  the
       recipients, indicating the "controlling user" information.
       This shows who will own any programs that are executed  on
       behalf  of  this  message  and  the name of the alias from
       which this command expanded, if any.
