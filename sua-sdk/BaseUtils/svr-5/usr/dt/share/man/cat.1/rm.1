       rm removes the entries for one or more files from a direc-
       tory.  If a file has no write permission and the  standard
       input  is  a  terminal,  the  full  set of permissions (in
       octal) for the file are printed to stderr, followed  by  a
       question mark.  This is a prompt for confirmation.  If the
       answer is an affirmative response, the  file  is  deleted,
       otherwise  the  file remains.  (The form of an affirmative
       response is locale dependent: y in the C locale, see  LANG
       on

       If  file is a symbolic link, the link will be removed, but
       the file or directory to  which  it  refers  will  not  be
       deleted.   A user does not need write permission on a sym-
       bolic link to remove it, provided they have write  permis-
       sions in the directory.

       Note  that  if  the  standard input is not a terminal, the
       command will operate as if the -f option is in effect.

       rm has the  following  options:  This  option  causes  the
       removal of all files (whether write-protected or not) in a
       directory without prompting the  user.   In  a  write-pro-
       tected  directory, however, files are never removed (what-
       ever their permissions are),  but  no  messages  are  dis-
       played.   If the removal of a write-protected directory is
       attempted, this option will not suppress an error message.
       With  this  option,  confirmation  of removal of any files
       occurs interactively.  It remains in effect  even  if  the
       standard  input  is  not  a  terminal.  If  both -i and -f
       options are present on the command line, the  last  option
       takes precedence.

       If  -i and either -R or -r are specified, confirmation for
       removal of directories occurs twice: once when the  direc-
       tory is entered and once after all files have been removed
       from the directory  and  the  directory  itself  is  being
       deleted.   This option causes the recursive removal of any
       directories and subdirectories in the argument list.   The
       directory will be emptied of files and removed.  Note that
       the user is normally prompted for removal  of  any  write-
       protected  files which the directory contains.  The write-
       protected files are removed without prompting, however, if
       the  -f  option is used, or if the standard input is not a
       terminal and the -i option is not used.  Similarly, if  an
       attempt  is  made  to remove a non-writable directory, you
       will be prompted, unless -f is specified.

       Symbolic links that are encountered with this option  will
       not be traversed.

                                                                1

rm(1)                                                       rm(1)

       If  the  removal of a non-empty, write-protected directory
       is attempted, the command will always fail (even if the -f
       option  is  used),  resulting  in  an error message.  This
       option is the same as -r.

       All messages are generally self-explanatory.

       If either the files . and .. are specified as the basename
       portion  of an operand (that is, the final pathname compo-
       nent), rm writes a diagnostic message  to  standard  error
       and  does  nothing  more  with such operands.  The message
       tells you that rm can't remove the  current  directory  or
       .. .

       A  --  permits  the user to mark explicitly the end of any
       command line options, allowing rm  to  recognize  filename
       arguments  that  begin  with a -.  As an aid to BSD migra-
       tion, rm will accept - as a synonym for --.   This  migra-
       tion aid may disappear in a future release.  If a -- and a
       - both appear on the same command line, the second will be
       interpreted as a filename.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
