       cal  prints a calendar for the specified year.  If a month
       is also specified, a  calendar  just  for  that  month  is
       printed.  If neither is specified, a calendar for the pre-
       sent month is printed.  The month is a  number  between  1
       and 12.  The year can be between 1 and 9999.  The calendar
       produced is in the form of a Gregorian calendar  (as  used
       in  Western  Europe  and the United States), but the month
       and the abbreviated day names are taken  from  the  locale
       given by the environment variable LC_TIME.

       cal  examines  the environment variables LC_TIME to deter-
       mine the names of the months and days,  and  LC_CTYPE  for
       how  to  print the characters the names are composed from.
       If the abbreviated day name in the locale entry is  longer
       than  two  screen columns in width, it is truncated to two
       columns.

       leap year adjustments.  To see this calendar, type: cal  9
       1752 The command cal 83 refers to the year 83, not 1983.

       The  year  is  always  considered to start in January even
       though this is historically naive.
