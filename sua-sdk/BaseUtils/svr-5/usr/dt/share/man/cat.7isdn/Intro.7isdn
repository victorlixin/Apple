       The  ISDN ioctls are used with the I_STR STREAM ioctl that
       is documented on the manual page.

       ISDN  ioctls  are  used to change the operation of and get
       information about the network adapter being driven by  the
       ISDN  driver.   They  are  sent by the MAC user in STREAMS
       messages of type with any associated data passed in a mes-
       sage type.
