       This  function  call originates an event for filtering and
       delivery.  Any necessary indication filtering is performed
       by  this function (or by subsequent processing) before the
       event is forwarded to the management applications.

       Implementation note:  a compID value of zero (0) specifies
       that  the  event  was  generated by something that has not
       been installed as a component, and hence has no  component
       ID.
