       DmiSetIndicationCallbacks passes information on indication
       callback entry points from the application to  the  client
       front  end. Entry points set by this function are per-pro-
       cess globals.  The initial value of all callback addresses
       is NULL.  This means that no indications will be delivered
       until  DmiSetIndicationCallbacks  changes  the   settings.
       This  function is executed entirely by the client and does
       not send any command to the Service Provider.

       (Input) New set of indication callbacks. If this parameter
       is NULL, the function does not change the current callback
       setting.  (Output)  Pointer  to  the  application-supplied
       buffer to return the previous set of indication callbacks.
       If this parameter is NULL, the function  does  not  return
       the old entry points.
