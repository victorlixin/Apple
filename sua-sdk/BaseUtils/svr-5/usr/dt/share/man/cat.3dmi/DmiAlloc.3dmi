       DmiAlloc  allocates a size-byte memory block in the memory
       model specified by memDsc.  When successful, it returns  a
       pointer  to  the  allocated  block.  Otherwise, it returns
       NULL and calls the failure handler defined in memDsc.

       (Input) Memory block size in octets.  (Input) Memory model
       descriptor.   If  memDsc is NULL, the default memory model
       is used.  (Output) Pointer to an address in  memory  where
       the  DmiErrorStatus_t  code  is  returned or NULL.  If the
       status pointer is  NULL  then  the  error  status  is  not
       returned.
