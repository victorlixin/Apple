       DmiCreatePoolMemDsc is used to create a  pool  descriptor.
       Subsequent  calls to should use a pool descriptor to asso-
       ciate allocated memory with  that  pool.   Similarly,  the
       function  in  this memory model will release memory blocks
       belonging to the pool.

       When successful, the function  returns  the  memory  model
       descriptor.   Otherwise,  it  returns NULL.  If the status
       pointer is not NULL, then the referenced value  will  con-
       tain  the  DMI  error  code on return. Otherwise, an error
       status is not returned.  Multiple active pools  can  exist
       simultaneously.
