       The  DmiGetMultiple  function  retrieves  attribute values
       from the DMI Service Provider.  This command may  get  the
       value   for  an  individual  attribute,  or  for  multiple
       attributes across groups, components, or  rows of a table.

       The request array specifies the attribute values requested
       by the management application.  Each element of the  array
       specifies  a component, group, request mode, key list (for
       table accesses), and attribute list to retrieve.  The  key
       list  is  omitted  (NULL pointer value) for scalar groups.
       If the attribute list is  omitted,  the  service  provider
       returns  all  attributes  in  the group or table row.  The
       requestMode specifier allows the management application to
       request the first, next, or specific attribute value.

       The  rowData array contains the reply from the DMI Service
       Provider.  The structure of this  reply  is  identical  to
       that of the original request, with the same number of ele-
       ments that were in the request array.
