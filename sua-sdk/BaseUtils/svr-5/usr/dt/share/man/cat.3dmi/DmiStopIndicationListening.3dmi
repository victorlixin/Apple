       DmiStopIndicationListening tells the client  front-end  to
       stop  delivering  incoming indications to the application.
       The client front-end software stops all the RPC indication
       servers  when  an  application calls this function.  Call-
       backs already  executing  are  allowed  to  complete.   To
       resume  receiving  indications, an application should call
       the function again.   DmiStopIndicationListening  is  exe-
       cuted entirely by the client and does not send any command
       to the Service Provider.
