       DmiGetSysMemDsc returns the memory descriptor representing
       standard  system  malloc/free model provided by the client
       front end.  This memory descriptor  serves  as  a  default
       memory  descriptor  until the application changes the set-
       ting, using the DmiSetDefaultMemDsc function.  Do not  use
       malloc/free instead of DmiAlloc/DmiFree in this case.

       (Output)  NULL, or a pointer to an address in memory where
       the DmiErrorStatus_t code  is  returned.   If  the  status
       pointer  is  NULL,  the  error status is not returned. The
       only possible error code is DMIERR_NO_ERROR.
