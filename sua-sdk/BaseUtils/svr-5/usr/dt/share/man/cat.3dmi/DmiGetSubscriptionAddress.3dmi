       DmiGetSubscriptionAddress returns the address of the indi-
       cation server associated with the application, a given RPC
       and  transport.  This function requires that a local indi-
       cation server was already  started.   Applications  should
       use  the  function  to  start the indication server before
       calling this function.  The address returned by this func-
       tion includes dynamic end-point information needed to dif-
       ferentiate among multiple indication consumers on the same
       machine.  To provide the Service Provider with this infor-
       mation, an application should set the Subscriber  Address-
       ing field of the subscription and event filter rows to the
       retrieved address when  subscribing  for  indications  and
       events.

       types  supported  by  this  function  are  ``onc''  (ONC).
       (Input) Transports available to the indication server. The
       function returns the run time list of available transports
       (see  RPC  Information  Functions).  (Output) Pointer to a
       returned pointer to the indication server address  string.
       The  application  is responsible for cleaning up the allo-
       cated memory. For example, the  application  can  use  the
       function to clean up memory in a default memory model.
