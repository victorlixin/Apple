       DmiIndicationListenExt  tells the client front end to lis-
       ten for incoming indications for given RPC and transports.
       In  response  to  this call, the client front-end software
       starts the specified indication server.  To receive  indi-
       cations, an application must start at least one indication
       server. An application should call  DmiIndicationListenExt
       once  only  using RPC type onc.  Incoming indications will
       be delivered from the Service Providers where the applica-
       tion  subscribed  with  the  specified  RPC and one of the
       transports. The indication server forwards  these  indica-
       tions to the application through the callback entry points
       last set  by  the  function.   The  DmiIndicationListenExt
       function  returns to the caller immediately after process-
       ing all the instructions associated  with  this  function.
       This  function is executed entirely by the client and does
       not send any command to the Service Provider.
