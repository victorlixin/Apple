       The  DmiListComponents  function  retrieves  the  name and
       (optionally) the description of components  in  a  system.
       This  command is used to interrogate a system to determine
       what components are installed.  An enumeration can  access
       a specific component or may be used to sequentially access
       all components in a system.  The caller may choose not  to
       retrieve  the  component  description by setting the value
       getDescription to false.  The caller  may  choose  not  to
       retrieve  the  pragma  string by setting the value of get-
       Pragma to false.

       The maxCount, requestMode, and compId parameters allow the
       caller to control the information returned by the DMI Ser-
       vice Provider.  When the requestMode is DMI_UNIQUE, compId
       specifies the first component requested (or only component
       if maxCount is one).  When the  requestMode  is  DMI_NEXT,
       compId   specifies  the  component  just  before  the  one
       requested.  When  requestMode  is  DMI_FIRSTs,  compId  is
       unused.

       To  control the amount of information returned, the caller
       sets maxCount to something other than zero.   The  Service
       Provider  must  honor this limit on the amount of informa-
       tion returned.  When maxCount is zero the Service Provider
       returns  information  for  all  components, subject to the
       constraints imposed by requestMode and compId.
