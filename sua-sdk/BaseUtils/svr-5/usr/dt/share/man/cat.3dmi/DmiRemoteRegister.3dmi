       Management applications use the DmiRemoteRegister function
       to  open a session with the remote Service Provider speci-
       fied by node = { address, rpc, transport}.  You must issue
       the  DmiRemoteRegister or DmiRegister functions before any
       other  DMI  command  is  sent  to  the  specified  Service
       Provider.   The DMI Service Provider uses this function to
       initialize its internal state for subsequent calls made by
       the application.
