       This function provide for explicit application-level lock-
       ing of standard I/O objects.  It can be used by  a  thread
       to  begin a sequence of I/O statements that are to be exe-
       cuted as a unit.

       ftrylockfile gives the calling thread ownership of file if
       file is not currently owned by another thread.  This func-
       tion is similar  to  flockfile,  except  that  it  returns
       nonzero if the file is already locked.  It returns zero on
       success.

       A thread can do multiple calls to ftrylockfile and  flock-
       file  successfully  if  it currently owns the file, but an
       equal number of funlockfile calls are necessary to  relin-
       quish the object completely.

       On success, ftrylockfile returns zero and locks the stream
       file.  If the stream is  already  locked  by  a  different
       thread, it returns nonzero.
