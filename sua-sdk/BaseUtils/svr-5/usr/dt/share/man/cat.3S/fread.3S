       fread  reads  into an array pointed to by ptr up to nitems
       items of data from stream, where an  item  of  data  is  a
       sequence  of  bytes  (not necessarily terminated by a null
       byte) of length size.  fread stops  reading  bytes  if  an
       end-of-file  or error condition is encountered while read-
       ing stream, or if nitems  items  have  been  read.   fread
       increments the data pointer in stream to point to the byte
       following the last byte read if there is one.  fread  does
       not change the contents of stream.  fread returns the num-
       ber of items read.

       fwrite writes to the named output stream  at  most  nitems
       items  of  data from the array pointed to by ptr, where an
       item of data is a sequence of bytes (not necessarily  ter-
       minated  by  a  null  byte)  of length size.  fwrite stops
       writing when it has written nitems items of data or if  an
       error condition is encountered on stream.  fwrite does not
       change the contents  of  the  array  pointed  to  by  ptr.
       fwrite increments the data-pointer in stream by the number
       of bytes written.  fwrite  returns  the  number  of  items
       written.

       If  size or nitems is zero, then fread and fwrite return a
       value of 0 and do not effect the state of stream.

       The ferror or feof routines must be  used  to  distinguish
       between an error condition and end-of-file condition.

   EErrrroorrss
       If an error occurs, the error indicator for stream is set.

       fread fails if the file is a regular file and  an  attempt
       was  made  to read at or beyond the offset maximum associ-
       ated with the corresponding stream.

       fwrite fails when either the named stream is unbuffered or
       its buffer needed to be flushed and an attempt was made to
       write at or beyond the offset maximum.
