       fclose  causes any buffered data waiting to be written for
       the named stream (see to be written out, and the stream to
       be  closed.  If the underlying file pointer is not already
       at end of file, and the file is one  capable  of  seeking,
       the file pointer is adjusted so that the next operation on
       the open file pointer deals with the byte after  the  last
       one read from or written to the file being closed.

       fclose  is  performed  automatically for all open files on
       calling exit.

       If stream points to an output stream or an  update  stream
       on  which  the most recent operation was not input, fflush
       causes any buffered data waiting to  be  written  for  the
       named  stream to be written to that file.  Any unread data
       buffered in stream is discarded.  The stream remains open.

       When  calling  fflush,  if  stream  is a null pointer, all
       files open for writing are flushed.

       On successful completion these functions return a value of
       zero.  Otherwise EOF is returned.

       fclose and fflush fail when the file is a regular file and
       an attempt is made to write at or beyond the offset  maxi-
       mum associated with the corresponding stream.
