       ungetwc  inserts  the  wide (wchar_t) character c into the
       buffer associated with the input stream.  That wide  char-
       acter,  c, will be returned by the next getwc call on that
       stream.  ungetwc returns c.

       One wide character of  pushback  is  guaranteed,  provided
       something  has  already  been read from the stream and the
       stream is actually buffered.

       If c equals (wchar_t)WEOF, ungetwc  does  nothing  to  the
       buffer and returns WEOF.

       fseek erases all memory of inserted characters.

   EErrrroorrss
       ungetwc   returns  WEOF  if  it  cannot  insert  the  wide
       (wchar_t) character.
