       These  functions  provide  for  explicit application-level
       locking of standard I/O stream objects.  They are used  by
       a  thread  to  delineate a sequence of I/O statements that
       are to be executed as a unit.  grants thread ownership  of
       a file, suspends thread until ownership is granted similar
       to flockfile, except that it returns a value  for  success
       or failure relinquishes file ownership granted to a thread
       by a previous successful call to flockfile or ftrylockfile
