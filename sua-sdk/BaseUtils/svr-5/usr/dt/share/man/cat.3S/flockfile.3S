       This function provide for explicit application-level lock-
       ing of standard I/O objects.  It can be used by  a  thread
       to  begin a sequence of I/O statements that are to be exe-
       cuted as a unit.

       flockfile gives the calling thread ownership  of  file  if
       file  is  not currently owned by another thread.  A thread
       keeps ownership of the file until it calls funlockfile.

       A thread that tries to get ownership of  a  file  that  is
       currently  owned  by another thread is suspended until the
       current owner relinquishes the file.

       A thread can do multiple calls to flockfile and  ftrylock-
       file  and not get suspended if it currently owns the file,
       but an equal number of funlockfile calls are necessary  to
       relinquish the object completely.
