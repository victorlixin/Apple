       funflush causes any buffered data to be discarded.  Unlike
       fflush [see funflush does not write any pending  data  for
       output  streams  and  does  not attempt to synchronize the
       underlying file offset.  It is  principally  intended  for
       handling  streams connected to terminals as part of inter-
       rupt processing.  If stream is a  null  pointer,  funflush
       acts on all open stdio streams.  stream remains open.
