       This function provide for explicit application-level lock-
       ing of standard I/O objects.  It can be used by  a  thread
       to  end  a  sequence of I/O statements that are to be exe-
       cuted as a unit.

       funlockfile relinquishes ownership granted to  the  thread
       via  a  previous successful call to flockfile or ftrylock-
       file.

       A thread can nest calls to flockfile  or  ftrylockfile  as
       long  as each successful call has a corresponding funlock-
       file call to relinquish ownership completely.

       The behavior is undefined if funlockfile is called without
       a matching successful call to flockfile or ftrylockfile.
