       puts writes the string pointed to by s, followed by a new-
       line character, to the standard output stream stdout [see

       fputs writes the null-terminated string pointed to by s to
       the named output stream.

       Neither function writes the terminating null character.

       On  success  both routines return the number of characters
       written; otherwise they return EOF.

       The functions puts and fputs  fail  if  either  the  named
       stream  is  unbuffered  or its buffer needed to be flushed
       and an attempt was made to write at or beyond  the  offset
       maximum.

       puts appends a new-line character while fputs does not.
