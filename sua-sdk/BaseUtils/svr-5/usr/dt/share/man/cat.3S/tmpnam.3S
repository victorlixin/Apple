       These  functions  generate  file  names that can safely be
       used for a temporary file.

       tmpnam always generates a file name using the  path-prefix
       defined  as  P_tmpdir in the stdio.h header file.  If s is
       NULL, tmpnam leaves its result in an internal static  area
       and returns a pointer to that area.  The next call to tmp-
       nam will destroy the contents of the area.  If  s  is  not
       NULL,  it  is  assumed to be the address of an array of at
       least L_tmpnam bytes, where L_tmpnam is a constant defined
       in  stdio.h;  tmpnam  places  its result in that array and
       returns s.

       tempnam allows the user to control the choice of a  direc-
       tory.   The  argument dir points to the name of the direc-
       tory in which the file is to be created.  If dir  is  NULL
       or  points to a string that is not a name for an appropri-
       ate directory, the path-prefix defined as P_tmpdir in  the
       stdio.h  header  file  is  used.  If that directory is not
       accessible, /tmp will be used  as  a  last  resort.   This
       entire  sequence can be up-staged by providing an environ-
       ment variable TMPDIR  in  the  user's  environment,  whose
       value is the name of the desired temporary-file directory.

       Many applications prefer their  temporary  files  to  have
       certain  favorite initial letter sequences in their names.
       Use the pfx argument for this.  This argument may be  NULL
       or  point  to a string of up to five characters to be used
       as the first few characters of the temporary-file name.

       tempnam uses malloc to get space for the constructed  file
       name,  and  returns  a  pointer  to  this area.  Thus, any
       pointer value returned from tempnam may serve as an  argu-
       ment  to  free  [see If tempnam cannot return the expected
       result for any reason--  for  example,  malloc  failed--or
       none  of the above mentioned attempts to find an appropri-
       ate directory was  successful,  a  NULL  pointer  will  be
       returned.

       tempnam fails if there is not enough space.

       These  functions  generate a different file name each time
       they are called.

                                                                1

tmpnam(3S)                                             tmpnam(3S)

       Files created using these functions and  either  fopen  or
       creat  are temporary only in the sense that they reside in
       a directory intended for temporary use,  and  their  names
       are unique.  It is the user's responsibility to remove the
       file when its use is ended.

       If called more than TMP_MAX (defined in stdio.h) times  in
       a  single  process, these functions start recycling previ-
       ously used names.

       Between the time a file name is created and  the  file  is
       opened,  it is possible for some other process to create a
       file with the same name.  This can never  happen  if  that
       other  process  is using these functions or mktemp and the
       file names are chosen to render duplication by other means
       unlikely.

       When  used  in a multi-threaded application, tmpnam should
       have a non-NULL argument.
