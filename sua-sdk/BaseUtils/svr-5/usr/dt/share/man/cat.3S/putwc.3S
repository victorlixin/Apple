       putwc  transforms  the  wide  character c into a multibyte
       character, and writes it to  the  output  stream  (at  the
       position where the file pointer, if defined, is pointing).
       putwchar(c) is equivalent to putwc(c, stdout).

       putwc behaves like fputwc, except that putwc may be imple-
       mented as a macro that evaluates stream more than once.

       On  success,  these  functions  return the value they have
       written.  On failure, they return the constant  WEOF.   If
       an  I/O  error  occurs, the error indicator is set for the
       stream.  If c does not correspond  to  a  valid  multibyte
       character, errno will be set to EILSEN.

       These  functions  will  fail if the file is a regular file
       and an attempt is made to write at or  beyond  the  offset
       maximum associated with the corresponding stream.
