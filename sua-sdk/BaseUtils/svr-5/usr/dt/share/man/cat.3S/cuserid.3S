       cuserid generates a character-string representation of the
       login name that the owner of the current process is logged
       in  under.  If s is a NULL pointer, this representation is
       generated in an internal static area, the address of which
       is returned.  Otherwise, s is assumed to point to an array
       of at least L_cuserid characters;  the  representation  is
       left  in this array.  The constant L_cuserid is defined in
       the stdio.h header file.

   EErrrroorrss
       If the login name cannot be found, cuserid returns a  NULL
       pointer;  if  s  is  not  a NULL pointer, a null character
       ``\0'' will be placed at s[0].
