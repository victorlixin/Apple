       int ungetc (int c, FILE *stream);

       ungetc  inserts the character specified by c (converted to
       an unsigned char) into the buffer associated with an input
       stream  [see  That  character,  c, will be returned by the
       next call on that stream.  ungetc returns  c,  and  leaves
       the  file corresponding to stream unchanged.  A successful
       call to ungetc clears the EOF indicator for stream.

       The value of the file position indicator for stream  after
       reading  or  discarding all pushed-back characters will be
       the same as it was before the characters were pushed back.

       If  c  equals  EOF,  ungetc does nothing to the buffer and
       returns EOF.

       fseek, rewind [both described on  and  fsetpos  erase  the
       memory of inserted characters for the stream on which they
       are applied.

       ungetc returns EOF if it cannot insert the character.
