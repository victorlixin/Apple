       gets  reads characters from the standard input stream (see
       stdin, into the array pointed to by  s,  until  a  newline
       character  is  read or an end-of-file condition is encoun-
       tered.  The newline character is discarded and the  string
       is terminated with a null character.

       fgets  reads  characters  from  the  stream into the array
       pointed to by s, until n -1 characters are read, or a new-
       line character is read and transferred to s, or an end-of-
       file condition is encountered.  The string is then  termi-
       nated with a null character.

       When  using  gets,  if the length of an input line exceeds
       the size of s, indeterminate  behavior  may  result.   For
       this  reason,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that gets be
       avoided in favor of fgets.

       If end-of-file is encountered and no characters have  been
       read,  no  characters  are  transferred  to  s  and a null
       pointer is returned.  If a read operation  was  attempted,
       and an error occurs, such as trying to use these functions
       on a file that has not been opened  for  reading,  a  null
       pointer  is  returned.  If end-of-file is encountered, the
       EOF indicator for the  stream  is  set.   Otherwise  s  is
       returned.

       The functions gets and fgets fail when the file is a regu-
       lar file and an attempt was made to read at or beyond  the
       offset  maximum  associated with the corresponding stream.
       There is no data transfer.
