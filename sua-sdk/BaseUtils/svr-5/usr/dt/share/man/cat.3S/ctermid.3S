       ctermid  generates the path name of the controlling termi-
       nal for the current process, and stores it in a string.

       If s is a NULL pointer, the string is stored in an  inter-
       nal  static area, the contents of which are overwritten at
       the next call to ctermid, and  the  address  of  which  is
       returned.  Otherwise, s is assumed to point to a character
       array of at least L_ctermid elements;  the  path  name  is
       placed  in this array and the value of s is returned.  The
       constant L_ctermid is defined in the stdio.h header  file.

       The difference between ctermid and is that ttyname must be
       handed a file descriptor and returns the  actual  name  of
       the  terminal  associated with that file descriptor, while
       ctermid returns a string (/dev/tty) that will refer to the
       terminal  if  used as a file name.  Thus ttyname is useful
       only if the process already has at least one file open  to
       a terminal.

       When  used by a multi-threaded application, ctermid should
       have a non-NULL argument.
