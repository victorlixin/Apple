       The in.snmpd daemon is the Internet Simple Network Manage-
       ment Protocol (SNMP) server process. It also functions  as
       an SMUX server.

       snmpd  listens  for incoming snmp requests on the UDP port
       161.

       in.snmpd also listens on the TCP  port  199  for  incoming
       connect requests from the SMUX peers and various other TCP
       end-points connected to SMUX peers to exchange SMUX  PDUs.

       The  ports  on  which  the SNMP agent listens for SNMP and
       SMUX requests are specified in the Internet  Requests  for
       Comments (RFCs) that define these standards.

       The  optional  argument,  -v,  is used to enable debugging
       output.  Debugging information is written to standard out-
       put.

       Management Information Base on the local system.   Authen-
       ticates open requests from potential SMUX peers.  Refer to
