       The /etc/clustertab file describes the nodes participating
       in a cluster and it is used by administrative tools,  such
       as to administer and configure the cluster environment.

       The  system  administrator  is responsible for maintaining
       this file correctly  and  consistently  across  all  nodes
       within  the  cluster.  This file should be well protected,
       and a backup copy should be made after each  modification.

       The  system administrator can modify this file with a text
       editor.  Within this file, fields are separated  by  white
       space.   A  pound  sign  (#) in the first column of a line
       means that line is a comment.  Blank  lines  are  ignored.
       The  order  of the node definitions is insignificant; how-
       ever, having a similar file arrangement across  all  nodes
       makes administration easier.

       All  device  names  used  in  /etc/clustertab must already
       exist and be accessible by the user.  It is not  necessary
       for each node to use the same name as the device that sup-
       ports the private network of the cluster;  however,  using
       the same device names makes administration easier.

       The  /etc/clustertab configuration file must have one line
       for each node in  the  cluster.   Each  line  specifies  a
       unique  node  identifier,  the  node name, the device name
       (and optional unit number within the device), and the net-
       work address.

       Each  node  identifier must be unique within each cluster.
       If the node identifiers are not unique,  the  cluster  may
       behave erratically.  It is not necessary to assign consec-
       utive node identifiers.

       The node name is used to identify  the  node  symbolically
       and  is also used to communicate with the node through the
       Local Area Network (LAN).

       The device field is the device name of the local  communi-
       cations  device through which private messages are sent to
       the destination node.  The hardware on each  cluster  does
       not  need  to be arranged the same as the software, but it
       is highly recommended for ease of administration.

       The unit number further specifies  the  port  to  be  used
       within the device.

       The  network  address is used when the local node needs to
       communicate with the remote node in the cluster  over  the

                                                                1

       private network.  The local node sends the messages to the
       network address of the remote node.  To obtain the network
       address, run getmac devicename.
