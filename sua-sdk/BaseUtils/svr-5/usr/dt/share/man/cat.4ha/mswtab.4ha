       The mswtab file describes the MAC switch driver configura-
       tion.  It is used by the command  to  administer  the  MAC
       switch  driver.   Each entry in the file has the following
       format: msw-device-name interface-count MAC-address
          interface-name unit-number
          [interface-name unit-number]...  Name of the MAC switch
       driver  interface  (for  example  /dev/msw_0).   Number of
       underlying physical interfaces that comprise a single  MAC
       switch  driver  virtual  interface.  The MAC address to be
       used as the source address  for  all  packets  transmitted
       from  the physical interfaces that comprise the MAC switch
       driver virtual interface.  The full pathname of the under-
       lying  physical  interface (for example /dev/ee16_0).  The
       unit number of the underlying physical interface.  (Should
       be 0 for DLPI type 1 devices.)

       The  following  is  an  example of a mswtab file for a MAC
       switch driver virtual interface msw0 with  two  underlying
       physical  interfaces,  ee16_0  and  ee16_1:  /dev/msw_0  2
       00:AA:00:A2:63:B1
          /dev/ee16_0  0
          /dev/ee16_1  0
