       mas_close  closes  the metric registration file associated
       with the metric descriptor, md.   The  metric  descriptor,
       md,  must  refer to a file that was previously opened with
       mas_open.  mas_close deallocates memory and  destroys  any
       memory mappings that were set up by mas_open.

       On success, mas_close returns 0.

       On  failure,  mas_close  returns  -1 and sets mas_errno to
       identify the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       The metric descriptor, md, that was  passed  to  mas_close
       does  not  correspond to a metric registration file previ-
       ously opened with mas_open.
