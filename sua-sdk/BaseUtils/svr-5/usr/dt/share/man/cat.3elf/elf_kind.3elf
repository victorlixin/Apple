       This function returns a value identifying the kind of file
       associated with an ELF descriptor elf.  Currently  defined
       values  appear  below.  The file is an archive [see An ELF
       descriptor may also be associated with an archive  member,
       not  the  archive itself, and then elf_kind identifies the
       member's type.  The file is a COFF object file.  describes
       the library's handling for COFF files.  The file is an ELF
       file.  The program may use elf_getident to  determine  the
       class.   Other  functions, such as elf_getehdr, are avail-
       able to retrieve other file information.  This indicates a
       kind of file unknown to the library.

       Other values are reserved, to be assigned as needed to new
       kinds of files.  elf should be a value previously returned
       by  elf_begin.   A  null  pointer  is allowed, to simplify
       error handling, and causes elf_kind to return  ELF_K_NONE.
