       nlist  examines the name list in the executable file whose
       name is pointed to by file,  and  selectively  extracts  a
       list  of values and puts them in the array of nlist struc-
       tures pointed to by nl.  The name list nl consists  of  an
       array  of structures containing names of variables, types,
       and values.  The list is terminated with a null name, that
       is,  a  null  string is in the name position of the struc-
       ture.  Each variable name is looked up in the name list of
       the  file.  If the name is found, the type, value, storage
       class, and section number of the name are inserted in  the
       other  fields.  The type field may be set to 0 if the file
       was not compiled with the -g option to nlist  will  always
       return  the  information for an external symbol of a given
       name if the name exists in the file.  If an external  sym-
       bol does not exist, and there is more than one symbol with
       the specified name in the file  (such  as  static  symbols
       defined  in  separate  files), the values returned will be
       for the last occurrence of that name in the file.  If  the
       name  is  not  found,  all  fields in the structure except
       n_name are set to 0.

       nlist and  nlist32  are  used  with  32-bit  ELF  objects.
       nlist64 is used with 64-bit ELF objects.

       If  you  want  to examine symbols in a running kernel (and
       these symbols are associated  with  a  dynamically  loaded
       module), then you must use ioctl [see or instead of nlist.
       To learn if a module is dynamically loaded, check  to  see
       if it is present in /etc/conf/mod.d.

       All  value entries are set to 0 if the file cannot be read
       or if it does not contain a valid name list.

       nlist returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
