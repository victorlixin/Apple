       elf_getarsym  returns  a  pointer  to  the  archive symbol
       table, if one is available for  the  ELF  descriptor  elf.
       Otherwise,  the  archive  doesn't  have a symbol table, an
       error occurred, or elf was null; elf_getarsym then returns
       a  null value.  The symbol table is an array of structures
       that      include       the       following       members.
            char      *as_name;            size_t         as_off;
            unsigned long  as_hash;

       These members have the following semantics.  A pointer  to
       a null-terminated symbol name resides here.  This value is
       a byte offset from the beginning of  the  archive  to  the
       member's header.  The archive member residing at the given
       offset defines the associated symbol.   Values  in  as_off
       may  be  passed  as  arguments  to  elf_rand to access the
       desired archive member.  This is  a  hash  value  for  the
       name, as computed by elf_hash.

       If ptr is non-null, the library stores the number of table
       entries in the location to which ptr points.   This  value
       is set to zero when the return value is null.  The table's
       last entry, which is included in the  count,  has  a  null
       as_name, a zero value for as_off, and ~0UL for as_hash.
