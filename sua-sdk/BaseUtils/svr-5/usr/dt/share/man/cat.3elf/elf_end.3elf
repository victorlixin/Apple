       A  program  uses  elf_end  to terminate an ELF descriptor,
       elf, and to deallocate data associated with  the  descrip-
       tor.   Until the program terminates a descriptor, the data
       remain  allocated.   elf  should  be  a  value  previously
       returned  by  elf_begin;  a  null pointer is allowed as an
       argument, to simplify  error  handling.   If  the  program
       wishes to write data associated with the ELF descriptor to
       the file, it must use elf_update before calling elf_end.

       As explains, a descriptor can have more than  one  activa-
       tion.   Calling elf_end removes one activation and returns
       the remaining activation count.  The library does not ter-
       minate  the  descriptor until the activation count reaches
       zero.  Consequently, a zero return value indicates the ELF
       descriptor is no longer valid.
