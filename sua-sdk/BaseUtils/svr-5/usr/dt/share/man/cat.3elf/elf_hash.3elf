       elf_hash  computes  a  hash value, given a null terminated
       string, name.  The returned hash value, h, can be used  as
       a  bucket  index,  typically  after  computing  h mod x to
       ensure appropriate bounds.

       Hash tables may be  built  on  one  machine  and  used  on
       another because elf_hash uses unsigned arithmetic to avoid
       possible differences in various  machines'  signed  arith-
       metic.   Although  name  is shown as char* above, elf_hash
       treats it as unsigned char* to avoid sign  extension  dif-
       ferences.   Using  char*  eliminates  type  conflicts with
       expressions such as elf_hash("name").

       ELF files' symbol hash  tables  are  computed  using  this
       function  [see  and  The hash value returned is guaranteed
       not to be the bit pattern of all ones (~0UL).
