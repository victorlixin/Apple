       elf_getarhdr  returns  a  pointer  to  an  archive  member
       header, if one is available for the  ELF  descriptor  elf.
       Otherwise,  no  archive  member  header  exists,  an error
       occurred, or elf was null;  elf_getarhdr  then  returns  a
       null  value.   The  header includes the following members.
            char      *ar_name;           time_t         ar_date;
            long      ar_uid;                   long      ar_gid;
            unsigned                            long     ar_mode;
            off_t          ar_size;      char      *ar_rawname;

       An  archive  member  name, available through ar_name, is a
       null-terminated string, with the ar format control charac-
       ters  removed.   The ar_rawname member holds a null-termi-
       nated string that represents the original  name  bytes  in
       the  file,  including  the  terminating slash and trailing
       blanks as specified in the archive format.

       In addition to ``regular'' archive  members,  the  archive
       format  defines  some special members.  All special member
       names begin with a slash  (/),  distinguishing  them  from
       regular  members  (whose  names  may not contain a slash).
       These special members have  the  names  (ar_name)  defined
       below.   This is the archive symbol table.  If present, it
       will be the first archive member.  A  program  may  access
       the archive symbol table through elf_getarsym.  The infor-
       mation in the symbol table is useful  for  random  archive
       processing  [see  This  member, if present, holds a string
       table for long archive member names.  An archive  member's
       header  contains a 16-byte area for the name, which may be
       exceeded in some file systems.  The library  automatically
       retrieves long member names from the string table, setting
       ar_name to the appropriate value.

       Under some error conditions, a member's name might not  be
       available.   Although  this  causes  the  library  to  set
       ar_name to a null pointer, the ar_rawname member  will  be
       set as usual.
