       elf_getbase  returns  the file offset of the first byte of
       the file or archive member associated with elf, if  it  is
       known  or  obtainable,  and  -1  otherwise.  A null elf is
       allowed, to simplify error handling; the return  value  in
       this  case is -1.  The base offset of an archive member is
       the beginning of the member's information, not the  begin-
       ning of the archive member header.
