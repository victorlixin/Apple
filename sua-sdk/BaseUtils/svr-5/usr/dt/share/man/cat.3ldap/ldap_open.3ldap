       ldap_open  initializes  a  session with an LDAP server and
       opens a connection in the process. After  opening  a  ses-
       sion,  it  is  necessary to perform a bind function to the
       server. See

       The alternative style of using  instead  of  ldap_open  is
       expected  to be the preferred mechanism in the latest ver-
       sion of the LDAP API specification, where use of ldap_open
       may be deprecated.

       As parameters, ldap_open takes host, the hostname on which
       the LDAP server is running, and port, the port  number  to
       which to connect. If the default IANA-assigned port of 389
       is desired, LDAP_PORT should be specified for port.

       The host parameter may contain a blank-separated  list  of
       hosts  to  try to connect to, and each host may optionally
       be of the form host:port. The host may be  either  in  the
       from  of  a  hostname  or  a  dotted  string  giving an IP
       address. If present, the :port overrides the port  parame-
       ter  to  ldap_open.  If more than one server is specified,
       the servers will be tried in  the  order  given,  stopping
       with  the  first  one  to which a successful connection is
       made.

       Upon successfully starting a session, ldap_open returns an
       LDAP  structure  which is used to identify the session and
       to maintain per-session information. Users are advised  to
       use  the  and functions to access the per-session informa-
       tion rather than accessing the structure directly.

       Note that there is a somewhat similar function,  which  is
       preferred by the latest API specification.

       If an error occurs, ldap_open returns NULL with no further
       qualifying information.  If  no  error  occurs,  ldap_open
       returns  a  pointer to an LDAP structure which can be used
       to identify the session.
