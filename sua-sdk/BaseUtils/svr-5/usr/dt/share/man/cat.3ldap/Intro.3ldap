       The  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) provides
       access to the X.500 directory or  to  a  stand-alone  LDAP
       server. The  LDAP package includes a stand-alone server in
       various LDAP clients, and an LDAP client library  used  to
       provide programming access to the LDAP protocol. This man-
       ual page gives an overview of the LDAP library routines.

       Both synchronous and asynchronous APIs are provided.  Also
       included   are  various  routines  to  parse  the  results
       returned from these routines.  These routines are found in
       the libldap.so library.

       The  basic interaction is as follows. A connection is made
       to an LDAP server by calling An  LDAP  bind  operation  is
       performed  by  calling  one of the functions documented on
       the manual page. Next, other operations are  performed  by
       calling  one  of  the synchronous or asynchronous routines
       (for example or followed by Results  returned  from  these
       routines  are interpreted by calling the LDAP parsing rou-
       tines. The  LDAP  association  is  terminated  by  calling
       Errors  can  be  interpreted by calling The routine can be
       used to set a routine to be called back when an LDAP  bind
       operation is needed when handling a client referral.

       Results obtained from the LDAP search routines can be out-
       put by hand, by calling and to step  through  the  entries
       returned,  and  to step through an entry's attributes, and
       to retrieve a given attribute's value,  and  then  calling
       one of the functions documented on the manual page to dis-
       play the values.

       The routines can be used to test a URL to see if it is  an
       LDAP  URL, to parse LDAP URLs into their component pieces,
       and to initiate searches directly using an LDAP URL.

       The routines implement a local client caching scheme, pro-
       viding  a  substantial  performance  increase for repeated
       queries.

       Also provided are various utility routines.  The  routines
       are  used  to sort the entries and values returned via the
       LDAP search routines. The routines are used  to  map  from
       short  two  letter  country  codes  (or  other strings) to
       longer, ``friendlier'' names.

       Also included in the distribution is a set of  lightweight
       Basic  Encoding  Rules  (BER) routines. These routines are
       used by the LDAP library routines  to  encode  and  decode
       LDAP  protocol  elements  using  the (slightly simplified)
       Basic Encoding Rules defined by LDAP.  They are  not  nor-
       mally  used  directly by an LDAP application program.  The
       routines provide a printf  and  scanf-like  interface,  as
       well  as  lower-level  access. These routines are found in
       the liblber.so library.
