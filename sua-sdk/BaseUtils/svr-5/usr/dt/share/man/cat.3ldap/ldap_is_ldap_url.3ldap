       These  routines  support  the  use  of  LDAP URLs (Uniform
       Resource Locators), as defined in RFC 1959. LDAP URLs look
       like   this:   ldap://hostport/dn[?attributes[?scope[?fil-
       ter]]] where: Host  name  with  an  optional  :portnumber.
       Base  DN  to  be used for an LDAP search operation.  Comma
       separated list of attributes to be retrieved.  One of  the
       following three strings: base one sub

       The  default is ``base''.  LDAP search filter as used in a
       call             to              For              example:
       ldap://ldap.itd.umich.edu/c=US?o,description?one?o=umich
       URLs that are wrapped in angle-brackets and/or preceded by
       ``URL:'' are also tolerated.

       ldap_is_ldap_url  returns  a  non-zero  value if url looks
       like an LDAP URL (as opposed to some other kind  of  URL).
       It  can  be  used  as  a  quick check for an LDAP URL; the
       ldap_url_parse routine should be used if a  more  thorough
       check is needed.

       ldap_url_parse  breaks down an LDAP URL passed in url into
       its component pieces. If successful,  0  is  returned,  an
       LDAP URL description is allocated, filled in, and ludpp is
       set to point to it. If an error occurs, one of these  val-
       ues  is returned: URL doesn't begin with ``ldap://''.  URL
       has no DN (required).  URL scope string is invalid.  Can't
       allocate memory space.  ldap_free_urldesc should be called
       to free an LDAP URL description that was obtained  from  a
       call to ldap_url_parse.

       ldap_url_search  initiates  an  asynchronous  LDAP  search
       based on the contents of the url string. This routine acts
       just  like  except  that many search parameters are pulled
       out of the URL.

       ldap_url_search_s performs a synchronous LDAP search based

                                                                1

       on  the contents of the url string. This routine acts just
       like except that many search parameters are pulled out  of
       the URL.

       ldap_url_search_st  performs a synchronous LDAP URL search
       with a specified timeout.  This  routine  acts  just  like
       except  that  many search parameters are pulled out of the
       URL.
