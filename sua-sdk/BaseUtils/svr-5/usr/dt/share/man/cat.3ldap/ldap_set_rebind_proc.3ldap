       ldap_set_rebind_proc is an extension to the  LDAP  API  of
       RFC  1823,  that  provides  a mechanism for obtaining bind
       credentials while  chasing  referrals.  The  routine  with
       option LDAP_OPT_REBIND_FN provides the preferred mechanism
       for this functionality.

       The rebindproc parameter supplies a routine that  will  be
       called  back  to  obtain  bind credentials used when a new
       server is contacted during the following of an LDAP refer-
       ral.

       The  following  of  referrals  will  only  take  place  if
       LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS is set  to  LDAP_OPT_ON  (this  is  the
       default).  If  ldap_set_option  is  never  called  to  set
       LDAP_OPT_REBIND_FN,  or  if  it  is  called  with  a  NULL
       invalue.  parameter,  an  unauthenticated simple LDAP bind
       will always be done when chasing referrals.

       The LDAP library will first call this  rebindproc  routine
       to  obtain  the  referral bind credentials, and the freeit
       parameter will be zero.  If the rebindproc routine returns
       LDAP_SUCCESS,   referral  processing  continues,  and  the
       rebindproc routine will  be  called  a  second  time  with
       freeit  non-zero to give your application a chance to free
       any memory allocated in the previous call.

       If anything but LDAP_SUCCESS is returned by the first call
       to  the  rebindproc  routine,  then referral processing is
       stopped and that error code is returned for  the  original
       LDAP operation.
