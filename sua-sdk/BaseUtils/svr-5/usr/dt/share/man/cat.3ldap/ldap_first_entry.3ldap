       These  routines are used to parse results received from or
       the synchronous LDAP search operation routines and

       The ldap_first_entry routine is used to retrieve the first
       entry in a chain of search results. It takes the result as
       returned by a call  to  ldap_result  or  ldap_search_s  or
       ldap_search_st and returns a pointer to the first entry in
       the result.

       This pointer should be supplied on a  subsequent  call  to
       ldap_next_entry to get the next entry, the result of which
       should be supplied to the next  call  to  ldap_next_entry,
       and  so  on.   ldap_next_entry will return NULL when there
       are no more entries. The entries returned from these calls
       are  used in calls to the routines described in and so on.

       A count of the number of entries in the search result  can
       be obtained by calling ldap_count_entries.

       If an error occurs in ldap_first_entry or ldap_next_entry,
       NULL   is   returned.    If    an    error    occurs    in
       ldap_count_entries,  -1 is returned. See for a description
       of possible error codes.
