       The ldap_first_attribute and ldap_next_attribute  routines
       are  used to step through the attributes in an LDAP entry.
       ldap_first_attribute takes an entry as returned by or  and
       returns  a  pointer  to a per-connection buffer containing
       the first attribute type in the entry.  The  return  value
       should  be treated as if it is a pointer to a static area,
       that is, strdup it if you want to save it (see the  manual
       page for details of strdup).

       It  also  returns, in berptr, a pointer to a BerElement it
       has allocated to keep track of its current position.  This
       pointer   should   be   passed   to  subsequent  calls  to
       ldap_next_attribute and is used used to  effectively  step
       through  the  entry's attributes. This pointer is freed by
       ldap_next_attribute when  there  are  no  more  attributes
       (that  is, when ldap_next_attribute returns NULL).  Other-
       wise, the caller is responsible for freeing the BerElement
       pointed  to by berptr when it is no longer needed by call-
       ing ber_free. When calling ber_free in this  instance,  be
       sure  the  second  argument is 0. (See the manual page for
       details).

       The attribute names returned are suitable for inclusion in
       a call to to retrieve the attribute's values.

       If  an  error occurs, NULL is returned. See for a descrip-
       tion of possible error codes.

       The ldap_first_attribute routine malloc's memory that  may
       need to be freed by the caller via ber_free.
