       The  ldap_delete_s  routine  is  used  to  perform an LDAP
       delete operation synchronously. It takes dn, the DN of the
       entry  to be deleted. It returns an LDAP error code, indi-
       cating the success or failure of the operation.

       The ldap_delete routine is used to perform an LDAP  delete
       operation  asynchronously. It takes the same parameters as
       ldap_delete_s, but returns the message ID of  the  request
       it  initiated. The result of the delete can be obtained by
       a subsequent call to

       ldap_delete_s returns an LDAP  error  code  which  can  be
       interpreted  by calling one of the functions documented on
       the manual page. ldap_delete returns -1 if initiating  the
       request produced an error. On success, it returns the non-
       negative message ID of the request.
