       ldap_init  initializes  a session with an LDAP server.  It
       does not cause any contact with the server. After initial-
       izing  a  session, it is necessary to perform a bind func-
       tion to the server. See

       As parameters, ldap_init takes host, the hostname on which
       the  LDAP  server is running, and port, the port number to
       which to connect. If the default IANA-assigned port of 389
       is desired, LDAP_PORT should be specified for port.

       The  host  parameter may contain a blank-separated list of
       hosts to try to connect to, and each host  may  optionally
       be  of  the  form host:port. The host may be either in the
       from of a  hostname  or  a  dotted  string  giving  an  IP
       address.  If present, the :port overrides the port parame-
       ter to ldap_init. If more than one  server  is  specified,
       the  servers  will eventually be tried in the order given,
       stopping with the first one to which a successful  connec-
       tion is made.

       Upon   successfully   initializing  a  session,  ldap_init
       returns an LDAP structure which is used  to  identify  the
       session and to maintain per-session information. Users are
       advised to use the and functions to access the per-session
       information  rather than accessing the structure directly.

       There a similar function, which is defined  in  RFC  1823.
       For  the  latest  version  of the LDAP API, it is expected
       that ldap_init will be the preferred mechanism.

       If an error occurs, ldap_init returns NULL with no further
       qualifying  information.  If  no  error  occurs, ldap_init
       returns a pointer to an LDAP structure which can  be  used
       to identify the session.
