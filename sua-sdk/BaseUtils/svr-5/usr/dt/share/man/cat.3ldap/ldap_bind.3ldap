       These routines provide an interface to the LDAP bind oper-
       ation. They are defined in the LDAP API described  by  RFC
       1823,  but  are deprecated in the LDAP Version 3 API. They
       are supplied here as a transition aid.

       The method parameter is  used  to  indicate  the  type  of
       authentication  used.  The  only currently supported value
       for method is  LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE.  The  effect  of  calling
       ldap_bind or ldap_bind_s with LDAP_AUTH_SIMPLE may also be
       obtained by calling or

       The  ld  parameter  is  the  LDAP  session  identifier  as
       returned from or

       The  who  parameter  is the DN (distinguished name) of the
       user being authenticated. For an anonymous bind,  the  who
       parameter  may  be  set  to NULL or to a pointer to a null
       string ("").

       The cred parameter is the credentials associated with  the
       user.

       ldap_bind  returns  the message ID of the request it sent.
       The result of the operation can be obtained  by  a  subse-
       quent call to If ldap_bind fails it returns -1.

       ldap_bind_s  returns  LDAP_SUCESS  upon successful comple-
       tion,  otherwise  an  LDAP  error  indication   (see   for
       details).
