       The  Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) subsystem consists
       of at least one IDE Host Controller card that has at least
       one logical unit attached to it.

       The  IDE  subsystem  provides support for the IDE Advanced
       Technology Attachment (ATA) and the ATA  Packet  Interface
       (ATAPI)  devices  under  SDI  for  use with related target
       drivers.  This subsystem is accessed indirectly by opening
       an  appropriate  target  driver  to access a target device
       that is on an IDE controller.

       It is also possible for an application to access the  SCSI
       bus  subsystem  directly  by using the pass-through inter-
       face.  See

       This driver  now  supports  Ultra  DMA66  and  ATAPI  tape
       drives.

       Extreme  caution  should be exercised when using the pass-
       through interface.  It is possible to interfere with  nor-
       mal  system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to
       an active device.  Pass-through should only be used  to  a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.
