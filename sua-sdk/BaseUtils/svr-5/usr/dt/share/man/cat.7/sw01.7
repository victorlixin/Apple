       The  sw01  driver is an SDI-compliant Write Once Read Many
       (WORM) target driver that provides access to one  or  more
       WORM  drives.   Each  drive must be attached to a SCSI Bus
       that  is  controlled  by  an  SDI-compliant  host  adapter
       driver.

       Access to the particular drive is accomplished through the
       sw01 device nodes located in /dev/[r]worm.

       Each device node identifies a particular  drive  based  on
       the SCSI ID assigned to that drive.  The binding between a
       device node and a WORM drive is  as  follows:  WORM  drive
       with lowest SCSI ID WORM drive with next to lowest SCSI ID
       and so on.

       A WORM drive uses removable media  divided  into  consecu-
       tively  numbered,  fixed-size sectors that can be accessed
       in any order, similar to a hard disk.  Most of  the  stan-
       dard  tools  for  reading  and  writing to and from a hard
       disk, such as or work with a WORM drive.  However, keep in
       mind  that  for WORM drives, each sector can be written to
       only once.  This characteristic causes problems if a  WORM
       device is mounted without using the read-only flag, -r.

       represented WORM drives: Controller Number SCSI Bus Number
       SCSI  Target  ID  SCSI  Logical  Unit Number Nodes in this

       The drives are numbered sequentially starting at 1 as they
       are found by the system.
