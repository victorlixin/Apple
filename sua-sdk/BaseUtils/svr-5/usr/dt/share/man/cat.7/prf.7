       The  special  file  /dev/prf  provides  access to activity
       information in the operating system.   The  profiler  com-
       mands load the measurement facility with text addresses to
       be monitored.  Reading the file  returns  these  addresses
       and a set of counters indicative of activity between adja-
       cent text addresses.

       The recording mechanism is driven by the system clock  and
       samples  the  program  counter at line frequency.  Samples
       that catch the operating system are  matched  against  the
       stored text addresses and increment corresponding counters
       for later processing.

       The /dev/prf file is a pseudo-device  with  no  associated
       hardware.   If  the  prf device is not configured into the
       kernel,  to  turn  it  on  you  must  edit  /etc/conf/sde-
       vice.d/prf,  change  the  second  field  from  N to Y, and
       reconfigure the kernel.

       When the profiler  is  turned  on,  loadable  modules  are
       locked  into  memory and cannot be unloaded.  Subsequently
       loaded modules will also be locked until profiling is dis-
       abled.
