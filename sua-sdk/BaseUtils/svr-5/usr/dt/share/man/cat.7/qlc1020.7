       The  QLogic  PCI  SCSI host adapter subsystem enables SCSI
       target drivers (such as and to communicate on the SCSI bus
       with  target  controllers  and logical units.  This driver
       implements the Storage Device Interface (SDI) for such SDI
       target drivers.

       This  driver supports hot insertion and removal of devices
       on the SCSI Bus via the and commands.   It  supports  WIDE
       SCSI controllers.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.  See

       adapter driver name.

       Extreme caution should be exercised when using  the  pass-
       through  interface.  It is possible to interfere with nor-
       mal system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used  to
       an  active  device.  Pass-through should only be used to a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.

                                                                1
