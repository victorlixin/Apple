       The Adaptec AIC-7770 family host adapter driver provides a
       Storage Device Interface (SDI)-compliant interface to  any
       Adaptec Host Adapters based on the Adaptec AIC-7770 family
       of  SCSI  controller   chips.    These   devices   include
       AHA-2740/2742,   AHA-2740-T/2742-T,  and  any  motherboard
       implementations using the AIC-7770 SCSI chip.

       The Adaptec AIC-7770 family host  adapter  driver  enables
       SDI-compliant  target  drivers  (such as sd01 and st01) to
       communicate on the SCSI bus with  target  controllers  and
       logical  units.  This allows normal access to mass-storage
       devices using standard system interfaces and  filesystems.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.   See  Adaptec SCSI controllers cannot be used reli-
       ably with Emulex SCSI/ESDI bridge controllers (also  known
       as  AT&T  DCM/4E).  This is due to hardware-induced timing
       differences between these bridge controllers and any  SCSI
       controllers  other than the one that they were designed to
       be used with.  It is not possible to  provide  a  software
       solution to this problem.

       Exercise  extreme  caution  when  using  the  pass-through
       interface.  It is possible to interfere with normal system
       I/O  and  cause hangs if pass-through is used to an active
       device.  Pass-through should only be used to a device that
       is otherwise quiescent.
