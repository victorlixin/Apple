       sc01  is a Storage Device Interface (SDI)-compliant CD-ROM
       target driver that provides access to one or  more  CD-ROM
       drives.   Each  drive  must be attached to a SCSI bus con-
       trolled by an SDI-compliant host adapter driver (for exam-
       ple, see

       Access  to  a  particular  drive is accomplished using the
       sc01 device files located in /dev/[r]cdrom.   Each  device
       file  identifies  a  particular drive based on the SCSI ID
       assigned to that drive.  The binding between a device file
       and a CD-ROM drive is as follows: CD-ROM drive with lowest
       SCSI ID CD-ROM drive with next to lowest SCSI  ID  and  so
       on.

       Most  CD-ROM  drives  can handle CD-ROM disks that contain
       two types of data: informational data and audio data.  The
       sc01 driver allows access to both types of data.

       A  CD-ROM disk that contains informational data is treated
       as a random-access storage device, such as  a  hard  disk.
       The  information on the disk is divided into consecutively
       numbered, fixed-size (usually 2KB)  sectors  that  can  be
       accessed  in  any  order.   The standard tools for reading
       data from a random-access device, such as or can  be  used
       to  read  informational  data from a CD-ROM.  However, all
       write operations are prohibited.

       Audio commands control the operation of the drive's  audio
       output  hardware  (usually a headphone jack located on the
       drive).  For example, the  C_PLAYAUDIO  causes  the  audio
       hardware to decode and convert the audio data to analog at
       a specific location on the disk, and play the audio on the
       drive's audio output hardware.  Audio data is not returned
       to the host system.

       All audio data commands are  executed  through  the  ioctl
       interface  and  often  require  a parameter structure that
       identifies the audio data to be acted upon.  Unlike infor-
       mational  data,  audio  data is not referenced by a sector
       address.  The methods used to identify a  particular  sec-
       tion  of audio data should be described in the SCSI inter-
       face section of the reference manual  supplied  with  your
       CD-ROM  drive.   Audio  data  cannot be read as if it were
       informational  data,  and  informational  data  cannot  be
       played using the drive's audio hardware.
