       A  tape  drive (whether for cartridge, 9-track, 8-millime-
       ter, or DAT tape) is a character device  and  uses  device
       names in the /dev/rmt directory.

       The following tape device aliases are supported (the names
       reference the first tape device in the system): non-reten-
       sioning  rewinding  device  non-retensioning non-rewinding
       device retensioning  rewinding  device  retensioning  non-
       rewinding device unload on close device

       On  the first operation of the tape, a retensioning device
       seeks first to the beginning of the tape, then to the  end
       of  the  tape,  and  finally, to the beginning of the tape
       again.  Use a retensioning device for streamer  cartridges
       that  have  not  been  accessed for some time or have been
       transported between accesses.  The retension operation  is
       time-consuming, but it ensures that the cartridge streamer
       tape is tensioned properly.  A nonretensioning device does
       not cause retension of the tape before the first operation
       on the tape.

       A rewinding device will seek the  beginning  of  the  tape
       (rewind  the  tape) when the cartridge streamer is closed.
       A nonrewinding device does not rewind the  tape  on  close
       and  thus  enables  an  application to write more than one
       archive to the streamer tape.
