       The  BusLogic FlashPoint SCSI host adapter driver provides
       a Storage Device Interface (SDI)  compliant  interface  to
       BusLogic  FlashPoint  SCSI  Host  Adapters.  The supported
       devices  include  the  BT-930,  BT-932,  BT-950,  and  the
       BT-952.

       The  BusLogic SCSI host adapter driver enables SDI-compli-
       ant target drivers (such as sd01 and st01) to  communicate
       on the SCSI bus with target controllers and logical units.
       This allows normal access to  mass-storage  devices  using
       standard system interfaces and filesystems.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.  See

       BusLogic  SCSI  adapters  support the Tag Command Queueing
       feature as default.  To disable this feature,  change  the
       value    of    the    flashpt_do_tag   variable   in   the
       /etc/conf/pack.d/flashpt/space.c file from 1 to  0.  After
       you have changed the value in the file, rebuild the kernel
       for the Tag Command Queueing feature to be effective.

       Extreme caution should be exercised when using  the  pass-
       through  interface.  It is possible to interfere with nor-
       mal system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used  to
       an  active  device.  Pass-through should only be used to a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.
