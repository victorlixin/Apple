       The  LSI  Logic  (formerly  Symbios)  PCI  to  SCSI-2 host
       adapter driver, c8xx, provides a Storage Device  Interface
       (SDI)  compliant  interface  to LSI Logic 53c8xx, 53c1010,
       and 53c1510 chipsets.  These chips may be contained either
       on  a  computer's motherboard or on LSI Logic host adapter
       boards.  Both implementations are referred to as LSI Logic
       host  adapters.  Please see the for the current certifica-
       tion status  of  specific  device  models  on  &geminiREL;
       releases.

       This  driver  dynamically  maps interrupts, supports Wide,
       Ultra, Ultra-2, and Ultra-3 SCSI, scatter/gather, and mul-
       tiple  host  adapters.  In addition, the c8xx driver fully
       supports either single or multiple processor systems (mul-
       tiple processor systems must also have the SCO Symmetrical
       Multiprocessing Support package installed).

       The c8xx host adapter driver enables SDI-compliant  target
       SCSI drivers (such as sd01 and st01) to communicate on the
       SCSI bus with target controllers and logical units.   This
       allows  normal  access to mass-storage devices using stan-
       dard system interfaces and filesystems.

       It is also possible for an application to access the  SCSI
       bus  subsystem  directly  by using the pass-through inter-
       face.  See

       During the Power On Self Test (POST), the  LSI  Logic  PCI
       BIOS  queries  the  system  BIOS  for  all  LSI Logic host
       adapters.  The latest LSI Logic PCI BIOS version  contains
       a  Configuration  Utility,  allowing the user to view what
       LSI Logic host adapters are in the system.  The  user  can
       request  a  display  showing  what devices are attached to
       each host adapter.  Device operational characteristics can
       be modified and will be utilized by the c8xx driver during
       normal operation.

       Extreme caution should be exercised when using  the  pass-
       through  interface.  It is possible to interfere with nor-
       mal system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used  to
       an  active  device.  Pass-through should only be used to a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.

                                                                1
