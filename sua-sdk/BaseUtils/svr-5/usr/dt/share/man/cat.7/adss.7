       The Adaptec AIC-6x60 family host adapter driver provides a
       Storage Device Interface (SDI)-compliant interface to  any
       Adaptec Host Adapters based on the Adaptec AIC-6x60 family
       of SCSI controller chips.  These devices include AHA-1505,
       AHA-1510, AHA-1510A, AHA-1520/1522, and AHA-1720A/1722A as
       well as any motherboard implementations using the AIC-6260
       or the AIC-6360 SCSI chips.

       The  Adaptec  AIC-6x60  family host adapter driver enables
       SDI-compliant target drivers (such as sd01  and  st01)  to
       communicate  on  the  SCSI bus with target controllers and
       logical units.  This allows normal access to  mass-storage
       devices  using standard system interfaces and filesystems.

       It is also possible for an application to access the  SCSI
       bus  subsystem  directly  by using the pass-through inter-
       face.  See Adaptec SCSI controllers cannot be  used  reli-
       ably  with Emulex SCSI/ESDI bridge controllers (also known
       as AT&T DCM/4E).  This is due to  hardware-induced  timing
       differences  between these bridge controllers and any SCSI
       controllers other than the one that they were designed  to
       be  used  with.   It is not possible to provide a software
       solution to this problem.

       Exercise  extreme  caution  when  using  the  pass-through
       interface.  It is possible to interfere with normal system
       I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to  an  active
       device.  Pass-through should only be used to a device that
       is otherwise quiescent.
