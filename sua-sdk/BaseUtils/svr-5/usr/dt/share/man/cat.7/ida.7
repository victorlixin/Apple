       The  Compaq  Intelligent  Drive  Array (IDA) technology is
       used to distribute data across an array  of  hard  drives.
       It  unites these hard drives into one or more high-perfor-
       mance logical drives.  The drive array is  managed  by  an
       array controller.  The following controllers are supported
       by the ida driver: Compaq SMART  Array  221  Compaq  Inte-
       grated SMART Array Controller Compaq SMART Array 4200 Com-
       paq SMART Array 4250ES Compaq SMART 3200 Controller Compaq
       SMART  3100ES Controller Compaq SMART-2/DH Controller Com-
       paq SMART-2/SL Controller Compaq SMART-2/P Controller Com-
       paq SMART-2/E Controller Compaq SMART Controller

       These  controllers  interface  to  SCSI hard drives.  They
       have the ability to provide fault tolerance for  the  con-
       nected  drives  and optionally provide write cache for the
       logical drives.

       The User's Guide supplied by Compaq with  each  controller
       provides all the necessary information to install and con-
       figure the controller in a Compaq server.

       Some administrator tunable parameters that can be modified
       to  affect the behavior of the ida driver are found in the
       file /etc/conf/pack.d/ida/space.c.

       &gemini; requires unique numbers (starting at zero) to  be
       assigned  to  each  HBA controller that is to be used in a
       system. The boot controller must be assigned an HBA number
       of  0 for the system to boot up successfully. The HBA num-
       ber for each controller must be known by the system admin-
       istrator  in  order to locate the entries that are created
       for the attached devices under the /dev/  directory.  Each
       device  name  begins  with  cC, where C is the HBA number.
       (The    boot    driver,    for    example,    is     named
       /dev/dsk/c0b0t0d0p0.)   Compaq  drivers  follow  the  con-
       troller order specified during System  Configuration:  the
       controller selected as first will be HBA 0; the controller
       selected as second will be HBA 1.  If System Configuration
       has not been used to assign a controller order to a Compaq
       HBA controller, then an HBA number may be selected by  the
       driver.  The  driver  will  update  the  unit field in the
       resource  manager  database  with  the  selected   number.
       Assigning  the  numbers  using System Configuration allows
       HBA numbers to be selected before &gemini; is installed or
       has  discovered  the controller. For most other non-Compaq
       controllers, the HBA number will be assigned in the  order
       the  controller was discovered by the system. The HBA num-
       ber of these controllers can be  changed  by  editing  the
       unit field of the resource manager using the

       The  ida driver enables SCSI target drivers (such as sd01)
       to communicate with target controllers  and  with  logical
       units using the Storage Device Interface (SDI).

                                                                1

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.  See

       The  following  command  is  supported: Reads the extended
       Equipped Device Table (EDT) data structure that is  stored
       in the ida driver's internal data structure.

       Extreme  caution  should be exercised when using the pass-
       through interface.  It is possible to interfere with  nor-
       mal  system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to
       an active device.  Pass-through should only be used  to  a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.
