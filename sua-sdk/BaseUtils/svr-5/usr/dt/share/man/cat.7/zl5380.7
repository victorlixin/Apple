       The  zl5380  SCSI  host  adaptor driver provides a Storage
       Device Interface (SDI)-compliant interface to the  Trantor
       T160  adaptor and the SCSI interface provided by the Media
       Vision Pro Audio Spectrum 16 adaptor.  The driver  enables
       SDI-compliant  target  drivers (sc01 and st01) to communi-
       cate on the SCSI bus with target controllers  and  logical
       units.  This allows normal access to the SCSI devices con-
       nected to the Trantor T160 or Media Vision Pro Audio Spec-
       trum  16 host adaptor using standard system interfaces and
       filesystems.

       This driver is no longer supported.
