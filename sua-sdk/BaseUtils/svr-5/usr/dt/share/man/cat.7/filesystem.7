       The  &geminiRELtm; filesystem tree is organized for admin-
       istrative convenience.  Distinct areas within the filesys-
       tem  tree  are  provided for files that are private to one
       machine, files that can be shared by multiple machines  of
       a  common  architecture,  files  that can be shared by all
       machines, and home directories.  This organization  allows
       sharable files to be stored on one machine but accessed by
       many machines using a remote file access mechanism such as
       NFS.  Grouping together similar files makes the filesystem
       tree easier to upgrade and manage.

       The filesystem tree consists of a root  filesystem  and  a
       collection  of mountable filesystems.  The root filesystem
       contains files that are unique to each machine.

       The program attaches mountable filesystems to the filesys-
       tem  tree  at mount points (directory entries) in the root
       filesystem or other previously  mounted  filesystems.   If
       /var  is  configured  as a separate filesystem, it must be
       mounted in order to have a completely  functional  system.
       The root filesystem is mounted automatically by the kernel
       at boot time.

       See for descriptions of the files and directories  in  the
       root filesystem.
