       ptem  is  a  STREAMS  module that when used in conjunction
       with a line discipline and pseudo terminal driver emulates
       a terminal.  See

       The ptem module must be pushed [see I_PUSH, onto the slave
       side of a pseudo terminal STREAM, before the ldterm module
       is pushed.

       On  the  write-side, the TCSETA, TCSETAF, TCSETAW, TCGETA,
       TCSETS, TCSETSW, TCSETSF, TCGETS, TCSBRK, JWINSIZE, TIOCG-
       WINSZ,  and  TIOCSWINSZ  termio messages are processed and
       acknowledged.  A hang up (such as stty 0) is converted  to
       a  zero  length  M_DATA  message  and  passed  downstream.
       termio cflags window row and column information are stored
       locally  one  per stream.  M_DELAY messages are discarded.
       All other messages are passed downstream unmodified.

       On the read-side all messages are passed upstream  unmodi-
       fied  with  the  following  exceptions.   All  M_READ  and
       M_DELAY messages are freed in both directions.   An  ioctl
       TCSBRK  is converted to an message and passed upstream and
       an  acknowledgement  is  returned  downstream.   An  ioctl
       TIOCSIGNAL  is  converted  into  an  message,  and  passed
       upstream and an acknowledgement  is  returned  downstream.
       Finally  an ioctl TIOCREMOTE is converted into an message,
       acknowledged, and passed upstream.
