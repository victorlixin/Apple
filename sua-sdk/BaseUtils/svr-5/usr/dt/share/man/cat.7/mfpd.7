       The  Multifunction  Parallel  Port  Driver (mfpd) controls
       access to the parallel ports in the system. Various  types
       of  devices  such  as  printers or tape drives may be con-
       nected to  the  parallel  ports.  The  drivers  for  these
       devices  access the associated parallel port hardware only
       after requesting, and subsequently  having  been  granted,
       control  of  each  port  by the mfpd driver. A driver that
       requests control of a particular port may have its request
       denied  if access to that port has already been granted to
       another driver.  In this case, a driver-supplied  callback
       routine  is  used to notify the requesting driver when the
       desired port has become available.  Once access to a  par-
       allel  port  is  granted, the driver is free to access the
       port hardware as required. After using a port, each driver
       must relinquish control of the port to the mfpd driver. No
       driver is permitted to access the parallel  port  hardware
       without first obtaining permission from the mfpd driver.

       The  mfpd  driver is implemented as a loadable driver mod-
       ule.  Drivers that access the parallel port hardware  must
       include a dependency reference to the mfpd driver in their
       configuration files.
