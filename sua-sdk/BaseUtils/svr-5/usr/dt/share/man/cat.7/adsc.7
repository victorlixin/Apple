       The  Adaptec  Standard Mode host adapter driver provides a
       Storage Device Interface (SDI)-compliant interface to  any
       Adaptec  Host  Adapters  that support the Adaptec standard
       mode interface.  These  devices  include  AHA-1540B/1542B,
       AHA-1540C/1542C,        AHA-1540CF/1542CF,       AHA-1640,
       AHA-1740/1742,  and  AHA-1740A/1742A.    Note   that   the
       AHA-174x  and  AHA-174xA series are only supported by this
       driver when configured in standard mode.  Support for  the
       AHA-174x   and  AHA-174xA  when  they  are  configured  in
       Enhanced Mode is provided by the driver.

       The Adaptec Standard Mode host adapter driver enables SDI-
       compliant target drivers (such as sd01 and st01) to commu-
       nicate on the SCSI bus with target controllers and logical
       units.   This allows normal access to mass-storage devices
       using standard system interfaces and filesystems.

       It is also possible for an application to access the  SCSI
       bus  subsystem  directly  by using the pass-through inter-
       face.  See Adaptec SCSI controllers cannot be  used  reli-
       ably  with Emulex SCSI/ESDI bridge controllers (also known
       as AT&T DCM/4E).  This is due to  hardware-induced  timing
       differences  between these bridge controllers and any SCSI
       controllers other than the one that they were designed  to
       be  used  with.   It is not possible to provide a software
       solution to this problem.

       Exercise  extreme  caution  when  using  the  pass-through
       interface.  It is possible to interfere with normal system
       I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to  an  active
       device.  Pass-through should only be used to a device that
       is otherwise quiescent.
