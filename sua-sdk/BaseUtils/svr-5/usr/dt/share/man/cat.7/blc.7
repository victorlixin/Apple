       The  BusLogic  SCSI host adapter driver provides a Storage
       Device Interface  (SDI)-compliant  interface  to  BusLogic
       SCSI  Host  Adapters.  The  supported  devices include the
       BT-445C, BT-54x, BT-64x, BT-74x, BT-75x, BT-946C, BT-956C,
       BT-948, BT-958, and the BT-958D.

       The  BusLogic SCSI host adapter driver enables SDI-compli-
       ant target drivers (such as sd01 and st01) to  communicate
       on the SCSI bus with target controllers and logical units.
       This allows normal access to  mass-storage  devices  using
       standard system interfaces and filesystems.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.  See

       BusLogic  SCSI  adapters  support the Tag Command Queueing
       feature as default.  To disable this feature,  change  the
       value     of    the    blc_do_tag    variable    in    the
       /etc/conf/pack.d/blc/space.c file from 1 to 0.  After  you
       have changed the value in the file, rebuild the kernel for
       the Tag Command Queueing feature to be effective.

       Extreme caution should be exercised when using  the  pass-
       through  interface.  It is possible to interfere with nor-
       mal system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used  to
       an  active  device.  Pass-through should only be used to a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.
