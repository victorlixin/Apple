       A  console  terminal  is a terminal used to display kernel
       message and other system status messages, or  to  interact
       with  basic  system  services, such as The physical system
       console is the console terminal used  by  the  kernel  and
       selected by the CONSOLE parameter;
        must  be  a console-capable device, as indicated by the C
       flag in the characteristics field of the last line in  the
       device driver's file; the Master file should also have a K
       flag in the characteristics field.

       The file /dev/console  is  the  physical  system  console.
       Programmers should write console messages to /dev/console.

       /dev/console is selected by the CONSOLE parameter.  If  no
       CONSOLE parameter is set, the first console-capable device
       is used.

       The file /dev/syscon is the virtual system  console;  that
       is,  it  ``floats''  to  whatever  device was last used to
       change   system   states.    Usually   /dev/console    and
       /dev/syscon are identical.  uses /dev/syscon to prompt for
       system state changes and for other interactions.

       The file /dev/sysmsg is a  node  for  the  sysmsg  pseudo-
       device driver.  This driver sends I/O to the physical sys-
       tem console via console I/O entry points, rather than  the
       STREAMS   interfaces.   /dev/sysmsg  is  used  during  the
       sysinit phase of init since the console may not  yet  have
       been  fully initialized, and since init can not remake the
       /dev/console node  until  the  root  file  system  becomes
       writeable).
