       clone is a STREAMS software driver that finds and opens an
       unused major/minor device on another STREAMS driver.   The
       major  device  number  passed  to clone during open corre-
       sponds to the clone driver and  the  minor  device  number
       corresponds  to the target driver.  Each open results in a
       separate stream to a previously unused major/minor device.

       The  clone  driver  consists  solely  of an open function.
       This open function performs all of the necessary  work  so
       that subsequent system calls (including require no further
       involvement of clone.

       clone will generate an ENXIO error,  without  opening  the
       device, if the major/minor device number provided does not
       correspond to a valid major/minor device, or if the driver
       indicated is not a STREAMS driver.

       Multiple  opens  of  the same major/minor device cannot be
       done through the clone interface.  Executing on  the  file
       system  node for a cloned device yields a different result
       from executing fstat using a file descriptor obtained from
       opening the node.
