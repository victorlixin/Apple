       The  loopback  device  is a software mechanism that can be
       used for local communication.  The loopback driver returns
       all  packets it receives to their source without involving
       any hardware devices.  It is a STREAMS  device  that  con-
       forms  to  the  datalink  provider  interface (DLPI).  The
       driver only supports the Internet address family.  See for
       a general description of network interfaces.

       The loopback interface is known to the system as lon where
       n is typically 0.

       By default, the loopback interface is accessible at Inter-
       net  address 127.0.0.1 (INADDR_LOOPBACK).  This address is
       official and should not normally be changed.

       The kernel installs routes  that  cause  locally-generated
       traffic  destined for other local addresses to be sent via
       the loopback interface.  This is a  performance  optimiza-
       tion.

       The  loopback interface should be the first interface con-
       figured, otherwise name server lookups for  the  hostnames
       of other interfaces may fail.

       The  socket  type  should  be  SOCK_STREAM when using TCP,
       SOCK_DGRAM when using UDP, and SOCK_RAW when using IP.
