       This  DDI7  driver supports the Adaptec family of Fast and
       Ultra SCSI products for the PCI bus.  These  include  host
       adapters  such  as  the  AHA-294x,  AHA-294xW, AHA-294xUW,
       AHA-2940UW   Pro,   AHA-2940AU,    AHA-394x,    AHA-394xW,
       AHA-394xUW,  AHA-394xAUWD,  and AHA-4944UW, as well as any
       motherboard  using  the  AIC-7850,   AIC-7855,   AIC-7860,
       AIC-7870,  AIC-7880,  and AIC-7895 SCSI chips.  Please see
       the for  the  current  certification  status  of  specific
       device models on &geminiREL; releases.

       For  support  of  Adaptec's family of Ultra2 SCSI products
       for the PCI bus, please refer to the  manual  page.   This
       includes  the  AHA-2940U2W,  AHA-2940U2B, AHA-2950U2B, and
       AHA-3950U2x host  adapters,  and  motherboards  using  the
       AIC-7890,  AIC-7891,  AIC-7896,  and  AIC-7897 Ultra2 SCSI
       chips.

       This driver is complaint with the Storage Device Interface
       (SDI), enabling SDI-compliant target drivers (such as sd01
       and st01) to communicate on the SCSI bus with target  con-
       trollers  and logical units.  This allows normal access to
       mass-storage devices using standard system interfaces  and
       filesystems.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.   See  Exercise extreme caution when using the pass-
       through interface.  It is possible to interfere with  nor-
       mal  system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to
       an active device.  Pass-through should only be used  to  a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.

       The  Adaptec  PCI  host  adapter driver honors the command
       timeout values as specified in the scb structure; see  the
       manual  page.  A software watchdog timer enforces the pro-
       cessing time limit.  When the watchdog timer detects a job
       that  has  exceeded its processing time limit, it attempts
       to abort the job with  a  SCSI  Job  Abort  Message.   The
       driver  also  enforces  a time limit on the abort process,
       thereby ensuring that jobs that time out are  reported  to
       the  sending  SDI  Target  Driver whether or not the abort
       succeeds.
