       The  file  /dev/tty is, in each process, a synonym for the
       control terminal associated with the process group of that
       process,  if  any.   It  is  useful  for programs or shell
       sequences that wish to be sure of writing messages on  the
       terminal no matter how output has been redirected.  It can
       also be used for programs that demand the name of  a  file
       for  output,  when typed output is desired and it is tire-
       some to find out what terminal is currently in use.
