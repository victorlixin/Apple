       defined  in RFC 1334: the Password Authentication Protocol
       (PAP) and the Challenge-Handshake Authentication  Protocol
       (CHAP).  The use of these protocols on the local host (the
       authenticator) to authenticate a remote system (the  peer)
       is  controlled  by the requirepap and requirechap keywords
       in individual bundle and global bundle definitions in  the
       PPP  configuration  (see PPP configuration also stores the
       authentication information  used  by  these  protocols  as
       name-secret  pairs in auth definitions.  These definitions
       are also used  if  a  remote  system  (the  authenticator)
       requires  that the local host (the peer) authenticate with
       it.

       If PAP is specified during the PPP authentication negotia-
       tion  stage,  the  peer  to  be  authenticated sends a PAP
       authentication request to the authenticator.  The  message
       contains  a password for comparison with the one stored in
       the authentication database.  If the password is  correct,
       the  authenticator  sends  an authentication-ack reply and
       accepts the connection.  If the password is incorrect, the
       authenticator   sends   an  authentication-nak  reply  and
       refuses the connection.

       PAP sends passwords in  unencrypted  clear  text,  and  is
       therefore not very secure.

   CCHHAAPP ooppeerraattiioonn
       If CHAP is specified during the PPP authentication negoti-
       ation stage, the authenticator sends a CHAP  challenge  to
       the  peer that is to be authenticated.  The challenge con-
       tains a random value generated by the authenticator.   The
       peer  computes  a result based on the random value and the
       secret stored in its authentication  database.   The  peer
       sends  the  result  to  the  authenticator  in  a response
       packet.  The authenticator then computes  a  result  using
       the  secret associated with the peer and the original ran-
       dom value.  If the results match, the authenticator  sends
       a  success  packet to the peer and accepts the connection.
       If the results do not match,  the  authenticator  sends  a
       failure  packet to the peer and the connection is refused.

       CHAP provides a higher level of security than PAP  because
       the  secret  is not sent openly, and the random value pro-
       tects against replay attacks.
