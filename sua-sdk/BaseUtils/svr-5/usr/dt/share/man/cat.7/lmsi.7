       The  lmsi  host  adapter subsystem enables the SCSI target
       drivers sc01 to communicate with  target  controllers  and
       logical  units.  This driver implements the Storage Device
       Interface (SDI) for the sc01 SDI target driver.

       It is also possible for an application to access the  SCSI
       bus  subsystem  directly  by using the pass-through inter-
       face.  See

       This driver is  supplied  with  &SantaMlong;,  but  is  no
       longer supported.

       Extreme  caution  should be exercised when using the pass-
       through interface.  It is possible to interfere with  nor-
       mal  system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to
       an active device.  Pass-through should only be used  to  a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.
