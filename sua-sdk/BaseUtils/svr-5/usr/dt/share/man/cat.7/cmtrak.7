       Trakker  120 and Trakker 250 are two tape drives from Col-
       orado Memory Inc.  These drives  support  the  QIC-40  and
       QIC-80 standards respectively.  Normally, a cartridge for-
       matted in one drive cannot be used with  the  other  type,
       but  a QIC-80 drive can read data from a tape formatted in
       a QIC-40 drive.  The driver follows the mfpd  protocol  to
       use the parallel ports.

       The  driver  supports  the  following command: Send a SCSI
       command to  the  drive.   Using  SS_WRITE  to  write  data
       requires  a SS_FLMRK (write a filemark) command to be sent
       at the end to flush any remaining  buffered  data  to  the
       tape.

       Unsupported  SCSI  commands are: Send diagnostic.  Prevent
       or allow media removal.  Track select.   Skip  over  file-
       marks  only.   Return  bus_name  as  port  and drv_name as
       cmtrak in the bus_type structure.  Return  version  number
       of the HBA in the structure ver_no.

       The  SDI_BRESET ioctl is not supported because there is no
       SCSI bus.
