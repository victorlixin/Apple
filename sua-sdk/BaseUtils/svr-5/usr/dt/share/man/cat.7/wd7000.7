       The WD7000 FASST2 SCSI host adapter subsystem enables SCSI
       target drivers (such as sd01 and st01) to  communicate  on
       the  SCSI  bus  with target controllers and logical units.
       This driver implements the Storage Device Interface  (SDI)
       for such SDI target drivers.

       This driver is no longer supported.
