       For  hardware-related  files, the names of the entries are
       generally derived from names for the hardware, as  opposed
       to  the names of the special files themselves.  Character-
       istics of both the hardware device and  the  corresponding
       device driver are discussed where applicable.

       Disk  device  filenames  have  either of the two following
       forms: /dev/[r]dsk/cCbBtTdDsS
       /dev/[r]dsk/cCbBtTdDpP /rdsk  denotes  a  raw  (character)
       device;  /dsk  indicates  a block device.  C is the occur-
       rence of the host adapter board or IDE controller  in  the
       system  (that is, card number).  C can range from 0 to 31.
       B is the HBA bus number, ranging from 0 to 7 (dependent on
       the  add-on  adapter).  This is always 0 for IDE disks.  T
       is the SCSI target controller number (ID).  The value of T
       can  range  from 0 to 31.  The first IDE disk is target 0,
       and the second is target 1.  D is the logical unit  number
       of the disk device, ranging from 0 to 31. This is always 0
       for IDE disks.  S is the disk slice number, ranging from 0
       to b7 (hex).  P is the partition number.  P can range from
       0 to 4, to specify an entry in the fdisk partition  table.
       The  p0  node  corresponds to the whole disk, the p1 to p4
       nodes correspond to partitions as they  are  displayed  by
       the fdisk command.
