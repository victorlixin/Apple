       The  Olivetti  SCSI host adapter driver provides a Storage
       Device Interface (SDI)-compliant interface to the Olivetti
       adapters  that  support  the Olivetti standard mode inter-
       face.  These devices include: ESC2, ESC2mb, EFP2, and EFP2
       Enhanced.  The EFP2 controller provides up to 2 SCSI chan-
       nels (or buses), each of which can support a maximum of  7
       disks.

       This driver is no longer supported.
