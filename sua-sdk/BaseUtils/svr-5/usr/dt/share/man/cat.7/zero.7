       A  zero special file is a source of zeroed unnamed memory.

       Reads from a zero special file always return a buffer full
       of zeroes.  The file is of infinite length.

       Writes  to  a zero special file are always successful, but
       the data written is ignored.

       Mapping a zero special  file  creates  a  zero-initialized
       unnamed  memory  object of a length equal to the length of
       the mapping and rounded up to the  nearest  page  size  as
       returned  by Multiple processes can share such a zero spe-
       cial file object provided a  common  ancestor  mapped  the
       MAP_SHARED object.
