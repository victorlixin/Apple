       The dpt host adapter subsystem enables SCSI target drivers
       (such as sd01 and st01) to communicate  on  the  SCSI  bus
       with  target  controllers  and logical units.  This driver
       implements the Storage Device Interface (SDI) for such SDI
       target drivers.

       This  driver supports hot insertion and removal of devices
       on the SCSI bus using the and commands.  It  supports  DPT
       WIDE SCSI controllers.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.  See

       The  DPT  host  adapter  driver honors the command timeout
       values as specified in the scb structure; see  the  manual
       page.   A  software watchdog timer enforces the processing
       time limit.  When the watchdog timer detects  a  job  that
       has  exceeded  its  processing  time limit, it attempts to
       abort the job with a SCSI Job Abort Message.   The  driver
       also  enforces  a time limit on the abort process, thereby
       ensuring that jobs that timeout are reported to the  send-
       ing  SDI  Target Driver whether or not the abort succeeds.
       The DPT SCSI adapter  will  not  work  reliably  with  the
       Emulex SCSI/ESDI bridge controller (also known as the AT&T
       DCM/4E).  In the future, a hardware or  software  solution
       might be implemented.

       For ISA DPT controllers to work in UnixWare, the I/O ports
       must be set secondary/disabled.

       The following command is  supported:  reads  the  extended
       Equipped  Device Table (EDT) data structure that is stored
       in the dpt driver's internal data structure

       Extreme caution should be exercised when using  the  pass-
       through  interface.  It is possible to interfere with nor-
       mal system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used  to
       an  active  device.  Pass-through should only be used to a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.

                                                                1
