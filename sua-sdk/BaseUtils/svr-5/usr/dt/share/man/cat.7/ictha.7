       The  Integral  Cartridge  Tape  (ictha)  driver provides a
       Storage Device Interface (SDI)-compliant interface to non-
       SCSI QIC tape devices.

       This  driver  is  supplied  with  &SantaMlong;,  but is no
       longer supported.

       On ISA/EISA-based platforms, the ictha driver supports the
       following controllers and their associated drives: Wangtek
       Model PC-36, PC-02 Everex  Model  EV-811  Archive  SC499-R
       Archive SC402

       On MCA-based platforms, the ictha driver supports the fol-
       lowing controller and associated drive: Archive VP409A

       The ictha driver enables  the  SDI-compliant  tape  target
       driver,  st01,  to communicate with the QIC non-SCSI class
       of tape drives using standard system interfaces.
