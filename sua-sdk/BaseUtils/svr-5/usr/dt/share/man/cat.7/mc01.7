       The  mc01 medium changer target driver is the device-level
       driver for Small Computer System Interface  (SCSI)  medium
       changers.   SCSI Medium Changers mechanize the movement of
       media to and from primary devices (such as  disk  or  tape
       drives)  and  other  locations  within  the medium changer
       (magazines).

       The command provides command-line access to the mc01  tar-
       get driver.  This command allows the user to load, unload,
       position, initialize device status, and display  the  cur-
       rent device status.

       The special device files in the /dev/mc directory are used
       to access the medium changers attached to the system.  Two
       names are provided for each medium changer attached to the
       system.  The special device files have the  form:  is  the
       number, starting with 1, of the associated medium changer.
       There is one special file of this  form  for  each  medium
       changer  attached to the system.  is the occurrence of the
       host adapter board in the system (that is, card number) is
       the bus number is the target controller number is the log-
       ical unit number of the medium changer

       The device nodes in the /dev/mc directory  provide  access
       to  SCSI  medium  changers  attached and recognized by the
       system: Controller Number SCSI Bus Number SCSI  Target  ID
       SCSI  Logical Unit Number The changer number. The changers
       are numbered sequentially starting at 1 as they are  found
       by the system.
