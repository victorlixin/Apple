       pckt  is  a  STREAMS module that may be used with a pseudo
       terminal to packetize certain messages.  The  pckt  module
       should  be  pushed  [see I_PUSH, onto the master side of a
       pseudo terminal.

       Packetizing is performed by prefixing a  message  with  an
       message.   The  original  message  type is stored in the 4
       byte data portion of the M_PROTO message.

       On the read-side, only the M_PROTO, and messages are pack-
       etized.   All  other  message  types  are  passed upstream
       unmodified.

       Since all unread state information is held in the master's
       stream  head  read  queue,  flushing of this queue is dis-
       abled.

       On the write-side, all messages are sent down  unmodified.

       With  this module in place, all reads from the master side
       of the pseudo terminal should be  performed  with  the  or
       getpmsg system call.  The control part of the message con-
       tains the message type.  The data part contains the actual
       data  associated  with  that message type.  The onus is on
       the application to separate the data  into  its  component
       parts.
