       The  cram  driver provides an interface to the 64 bytes of
       battery backed-up RAM.  This memory  contains  information
       such  as  diagnostics  and configuration information.  The
       following ioctl calls apply:

       This call is used to read the contents of one of the  CMOS
       RAM  locations.   The argument to the ioctl is the address
       of a buffer of two unsigned characters, the first of which
       is  the  address  to  be read.  The ioctl will fill in the
       second byte with the data.  An  address  less  than  0  or
       greater than 63 will result in an error, with errno set to
       ENXIO.  This call is used to write a value into one of the
       CMOS  RAM  locations.   The  argument  to the ioctl is the
       address of a buffer of two unsigned characters, the  first
       of  which  is  the  address and the second of which is the
       value to write at that address.  An address less than 0 or
       greater than 63 will result in an error, with errno set to
       ENXIO.  Note that only the superuser may open the CMOS RAM
       device for writing, and that the CMOSWRITE ioctl will fail
       for any other than the superuser.
