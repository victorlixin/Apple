       This  DDI8  driver supports the Adaptec family of Ultra160
       SCSI products for  the  PCI  bus.   This  family  supports
       Ultra160  SCSI  devices which execute data transfers at up
       to 160 MB/second (twice the speed of Ultra2  Adaptec  SCSI
       products)  and  support  full  backward compatibility with
       existing Ultra2, fast and Ultra SCSI devices.  These prod-
       ucts  also provide 66 MHz, 64-bit PCI operation needed for
       server environments or standard 33 MHz, 32-bit PCI  opera-
       tion.   All of Adaptec's Ultra160 SCSI Cards support large
       memory servers with greater than 4GB of RAM.

       This driver support host adapters such as the single chan-
       nel Adaptec SCSI Card 29160, 29160N, and 29160LP, the dual
       channel Adaptec SCSI Card 39160, and motherboard implemen-
       tations  using  the  AIC-7899  and  AIC-7892 Ultra160 SCSI
       chips.  Please see the for the current certification  sta-
       tus of specific device models on &geminiREL; releases.

       For  support  of  Adaptec's  family of Fast and Ultra SCSI
       products for the PCI bus, please refer to the manual page.
       This   includes   host  adapters  such  as  the  AHA-294x,
       AHA-294xW,   AHA-294xUW,   AHA-2940UW   Pro,   AHA-2940AU,
       AHA-394x,   AHA-394xW,   AHA-394xUW,   AHA-394xAUWD,   and
       AHA-4944UW, as well as any motherboard using the AIC-7850,
       AIC-7855,  AIC-7860, AIC-7870, AIC-7880, and AIC-7895 SCSI
       chips.

       This driver complies with  the  Storage  Device  Interface
       (SDI), enabling SDI-compliant target drivers (such as sd01
       and st01) to communicate on the SCSI bus with target  con-
       trollers  and logical units.  This allows normal access to
       mass-storage devices using standard system interfaces  and
       filesystems.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.   See  Exercise extreme caution when using the pass-
       through interface.  It is possible to interfere with  nor-
       mal  system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to
       an active device.  Pass-through should only be used  to  a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.

       The  Adaptec  PCI  host  adapter driver honors the command
       timeout values as specified in the scb structure; see  the
       manual  page.  A software watchdog timer enforces the pro-
       cessing time limit.  When the watchdog timer detects a job
       that  has  exceeded its processing time limit, it attempts
       to abort the job with  a  SCSI  Job  Abort  Message.   The
       driver  also  enforces  a time limit on the abort process,
       thereby ensuring that jobs that time out are  reported  to
       the  sending  SDI  Target  Driver whether or not the abort
       succeeds.

                                                                1
