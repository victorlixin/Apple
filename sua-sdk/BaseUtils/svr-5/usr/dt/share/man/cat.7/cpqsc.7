       The  cpqsc  host  adapter  subsystem  enables  SCSI target
       drivers (such as sd01 and st01) to  communicate  over  the
       SCSI  bus  with target controllers and logical units. This
       driver implements the Storage Device Interface  (SDI)  for
       such  SDI  target drivers. At the present time, the driver
       supports the following devices:   Compaq Wide-Ultra SCSI-3
       Controller  Compaq Integrated Wide-Ultra SCSI-3 Controller
       Compaq 32-Bit Fast-Wide SCSI-2/P Controller Compaq  32-Bit
       Fast-Wide  SCSI-2/E  Controller  Compaq  Integrated 32-Bit
       Fast-Wide SCSI-2/E Controller  Compaq  32-Bit  Fast-SCSI-2
       Controller Compaq Integrated 32-Bit Fast-SCSI-2 Controller
       Compaq Integrated 32-Bit Fast-SCSI-2/P Controller

       &gemini; requires unique numbers (starting at zero) to  be
       assigned  to  each  HBA controller that is to be used in a
       system. The boot controller must be assigned an HBA number
       of  0 for the system to boot up successfully. The HBA num-
       ber for each controller must be known by the system admin-
       istrator  in  order to locate the entries that are created
       for the attached devices under the /dev/  directory.  Each
       device  name  begins  with  cC, where C is the HBA number.
       (The    boot    driver,    for    example,    is     named
       /dev/dsk/c0b0t0d0p0.)   Compaq  drivers  follow  the  con-
       troller order specified during System  Configuration:  the
       controller selected as first will be HBA 0; the controller
       selected as second will be HBA 1.  If System Configuration
       has not been used to assign a controller order to a Compaq
       HBA controller, then an HBA number may be selected by  the
       driver.  The  driver  will  update  the  unit field in the
       resource  manager  database  with  the  selected   number.
       Assigning  the  numbers  using System Configuration allows
       HBA numbers to be selected before &gemini; is installed or
       has  discovered  the controller. For most other non-Compaq
       controllers, the HBA number will be assigned in the  order
       the  controller was discovered by the system. The HBA num-
       ber of these controllers can be  changed  by  editing  the
       unit field of the resource manager using the command.

       It  is also possible for an application to access the SCSI
       bus subsystem directly by using  the  pass-through  inter-
       face.  See

       Some administrator tunable parameters that can be modified
       to affect the performance of the driver are  contained  in
       the file /etc/conf/pack.d/cpqsc/space.c.

       Extreme  caution  should be exercised when using the pass-
       through interface.  It is possible to interfere with  nor-
       mal  system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used to
       an active device.  Pass-through should only be used  to  a

                                                                1
