       The  mem  driver  manages  both physical memory and kernel
       virtual memory, and provides the driver  entry  point  for
       adding dynamic memory.

       The  file  /dev/mem  is a special file that is an image of
       the core memory of the computer.  For example, it  may  be
       used to examine and patch the system.

       Byte  addresses  in  /dev/mem  are  interpreted  as memory
       addresses.  References to non-existent locations may cause
       errors to be returned.

       Examining  and patching device registers is likely to lead
       to unexpected results when read-only  or  write-only  bits
       are present.

       The  file  /dev/kmem  is  the same as /dev/mem except that
       kernel virtual  memory  rather  than  physical  memory  is
       accessed.

       Detecting the dynamic addition of memory on a running sys-
       tem is the responsibility of the hardware and  the  device
       driver.  Device drivers that provide the ability to dynam-
       ically add memory to the system call the  following  func-
       tion at the base level, with no locks held, to perform the
       necessary initializations for the memory range  specified:
       int  dynamic_add_memory(paddr64_t  base,  memsize_t  size,
       uint_t flags) Base address of the memory  (64-bit  value).
       Size  of  the  memory (64-bit value).  Not currently used;
       must be set to 0.

       If successful, this function  initializes  the  memory  as
       dedicated or general purpose memory; see This function can
       return the following errors: Memory is out of range.   The
       memory  range  specified  is not a multiple of 32MB.  Some
       part of the specified memory range is already  present  in
       the system.

       Some  of  /dev/kmem  cannot  be read because of write-only
       addresses or unequipped memory addresses.
