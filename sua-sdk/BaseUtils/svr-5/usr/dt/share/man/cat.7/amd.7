       The  amd  host  adapter  driver  provides a Storage Device
       Interface (SDI)-compliant interface to various SCSI  solu-
       tions based on the Am53C974 PCscsi and Am73C974 PCnet-scsi
       chips.  The Am53C974 is a Bus  Mastering  Fast  SCSI  Con-
       troller  Chip  for  PCI Systems, whereas the Am73C974 is a
       combination Ethernet/SCSI controller.  The  Am53C974  chip
       is found on the motherboard of various systems and on con-
       troller cards from various manufacturers.

       The amd host adapter driver enables  SDI-compliant  target
       drivers (such as sd01 and st01) to communicate on the SCSI
       bus with  target  controllers  and  logical  units.   This
       allows  normal  access to mass-storage devices using stan-
       dard system interfaces and filesystems.

       It is also possible for an application to access the  SCSI
       bus  subsystem  directly  by using the pass-through inter-
       face.  See

       Extreme caution should be exercised when using  the  pass-
       through  interface.  It is possible to interfere with nor-
       mal system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used  to
       an  active  device.  Pass-through should only be used to a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.
