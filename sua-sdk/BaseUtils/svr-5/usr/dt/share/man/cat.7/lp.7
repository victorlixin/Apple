       The  parallel  port  (lp) driver supports both the primary
       (monochrome)  and  secondary  parallel  printer   adapters
       simultaneously.   Up to two printers are supported.  If an
       adapter for a printer is not installed, an attempt to open
       it  will  fail.   The close waits until all output is com-
       pleted before returning to the user.  The lp driver allows
       only one process at a time to write to the adapter.  If it
       is already busy, an open for writing will return an error.
       However, the driver allows multiple opens to occur if they
       are read-only.

       The parallel printer adapters are character devices.   The
       minor  device  number  corresponds  to the primary or sec-
       ondary parallel printer adapter.   Thus,  minor  device  0
       corresponds to the primary parallel printer adapter, while
       minor device 1 corresponds to the secondary adapter.

       The parallel port behaves as described in
