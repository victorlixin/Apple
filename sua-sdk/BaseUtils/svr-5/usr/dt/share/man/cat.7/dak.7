       The Mylex PCI DAC960 SCSI Disk Array Controllers are high-
       performance multiple channel controllers for disk  arrays.
       The dak host adapter driver is a DDI7 driver that provides
       an interface to the Mylex DAC960 adapter that is  compiant
       with the Storage Device Interface (SDI).

       The  following  PCI-based  devices are supported: DAC960P,
       DAC960PL,   DAC960PD,   DAC960PDU,   DAC960PG,   DAC960PJ,
       DAC960PR,  DAC960PRL,  DAC960PT,  DAC960PTL0,  DAC960PTL1,
       DAC1164P, AcceleRAID 170, AcceleRAID 160, AcceleRAID  352,
       eXtremeRAID 2000, and eXtremeRAID 3000 (Fibre Channel RAID
       Adapter).  Please see the for  the  current  certification
       status  of specific device models on &geminiREL; releases.

       It is also possible for an application to access the  SCSI
       bus  subsystem  directly  by using the pass-through inter-
       face.  See Exercise extreme caution when using  the  pass-
       through  interface.  It is possible to interfere with nor-
       mal system I/O and cause hangs if pass-through is used  to
       an  active  device.  Pass-through should only be used to a
       device that is otherwise quiescent.
