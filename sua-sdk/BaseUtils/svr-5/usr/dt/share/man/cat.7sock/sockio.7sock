       The  ioctls  listed  in this manual page apply directly to
       sockets, independent of any underlying protocol.  The set-
       sockopt  call  (see is the primary method for operating on
       sockets, rather than on the underlying protocol or network
       interface.   ioctls  for  a  specific network interface or
       protocol are documented in the manual page for that inter-
       face  or  protocol.   The argument is a pointer to an int.
       Set the process-group ID that  will  subsequently  receive
       SIGIO  or SIGURG signals for the socket referred to by the
       descriptor passed to ioctl to the value of that int.   The
       argument  is  a  pointer to an int.  Set the value of that
       int to the process-group ID that  is  receiving  SIGIO  or
       SIGURG  signals for the socket referred to by the descrip-
       tor passed to ioctl.  The argument is a pointer to an int.
       Set the value of that int to 1 if the read pointer for the
       socket referred to  by  the  descriptor  passed  to  ioctl
       points  to  a  mark  in the data stream for an out-of-band
       message.  Set the value of that  int  to  0  if  the  read
       pointer  for  the  socket  referred  to  by the descriptor
       passed to ioctl does not point  to  a  mark  in  the  data
       stream for an out-of-band message.
