       The  socket  driver is used to provide socket emulation to
       applications. Sockets provide an alternative to TLI as  an
       entry  point  into transport providers, such as The socket
       driver is a character device that  acts  as  an  alternate
       stream  head,  augmenting  the  functions  of the standard
       stream head. It also provides  support  for  miscellaneous
       functions such as

       The  behavior  of  sockets in handling asynchronous events
       and errors was changed  in  &geminiRELtm;  release  7.1.1.
       Compatibity  with  behavior  in earlier releases of &gemi-
       niREL; may be obtained using the  SI_U7COMPAT  command  on
       the  socket  file descriptor: #include <sys/sockmod.h> int
       err, fd, x; /* Create a  socket  */  fd  =  socket(domain,
       type,  protocol);  /*  Select new behavior */ x = 0; err =
       ioctl(fd, SI_UW7COMPAT, &x); /* Select old behavior */ x =
       1;  err  = ioctl(fd, SI_UW7COMPAT, &x); In the above exam-
       ples, the value passed in by the argument x  controls  the
       behavior  of  the  socket as follows: Select new behavior:
       For and an  asynchronous  error  causes  the  function  to
       return with an error without reading any data.  For and an
       asynchronous error causes the function to return  with  an
       error without writing any data.  For an asynchronous error
       causes POLLERR to be set in the revent member of the  file
       descriptor's  pollfd structure.  For an asynchronous error
       causes an exception to be set in the exceptfds fd_set that
       corresponds  to the file descriptor.  Select old behavior:
       blocks all signals except  SIGHUP,  SIGINT,  SIGQUIT,  and
       SIGTERM.   always returns EINPROGRESS when first called to
       establish an asynchronous connection.  If data received by
       a  connectionless socket is not for the connected address,
       can retrieve EINVAL set for  SO_ERROR.   Other  operations
       may  set  the  asynchronous  error  returned  by SO_ERROR.
       Default socket behavior is controlled by the value of  the
       ss_uw7_compat parameter.
