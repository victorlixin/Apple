       ticlts is a datagram-mode transport provider offering ser-
       vice of type T_CLTS (connectionless).

       /dev/ticlts is typically invoked as the implied device  in
       a  call  to  socket  or as the first argument in a call to
       t_open and is used to identify the transport protocol that
       will supply a connectionless transport service.

       The  device  known  as  ticlts  is  a ``loopback transport
       provider,'' that is, a stand-alone network at  the  trans-
       port level.  Loopback providers are transport providers in
       every sense except one: only one host (the local  machine)
       is ``connected to'' a loopback network.

       /dev/ticlts  may be used as a clone device to find a minor
       available device for the transport user.   It  presents  a
       TPI (STREAMS-level) interface to application processes and
       is intended to be accessed via the TLI (application-level)
       interface.   It  supports  address  spaces  consisting  of
       ``flex-addresses,''  that  is,  arbitrary   sequences   of
       octets,  of length > 0, represented by a netbuf structure,
       described in

       Loopback transports support a local IPC mechanism  through
       the  TLI  interface.  Applications implemented in a trans-
       port provider-independent manner on a client-server  model
       using  this  IPC  are  transparently transportable to net-
       worked environments.

       /dev/ticlts supports the same service type  (T_CLTS)  sup-
       ported by the OSI transport-level model.

       The  value  returned  by  a  call to open an endpoint with
       /dev/ticlts is a file descriptor characterizing  the  end-
       point.
