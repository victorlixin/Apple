       /dev/ticots is a connection-mode transport provider offer-
       ing service of type T_COTS.

       In the synopsis, s and t  are  file  descriptors  for  the
       respective  endpoints on calls to functions opening a file
       descriptor for a transport endpoint.

       /dev/ticots is typically invoked as the implied device  in
       a  call  to  socket  or as the first argument in a call to
       t_open and is used to identify the transport protocol that
       will supply a connection-based transport service.

       The  device known as /dev/ticots is a ``loopback transport
       provider,'' that is, a stand-alone network at  the  trans-
       port  level.   Loopback devices are transport providers in
       every sense except one: only one host (the local  machine)
       is ``connected to'' a loopback network.

       /dev/ticots  may be used as a clone device to find a minor
       available device for the transport user.   It  presents  a
       TPI (STREAMS-level) interface to application processes and
       is intended to be accessed via the TLI or socket (applica-
       tion-level)  interface.   It  supports address spaces con-
       sisting  of   ``flex-addresses,''   that   is,   arbitrary
       sequences  of octets, of length > 0, represented by a net-
       buf structure, described in

       Loopback transports support a local IPC mechanism  through
       the  TLI and sockets interfaces.  Applications implemented
       in a transport provider-independent manner  on  a  client-
       server  model  using  this  IPC  are  transparently trans-
       portable to networked environments.

       /dev/ticots supports the same service type  (T_COTS)  sup-
       ported  by  the  OSI  transport-level model and its use is
       encouraged.

       The value returned by a call  to  open  an  endpoint  with
       /dev/ticots  is  a file descriptor characterizing the end-
       point.
