       /dev/ticotsord  is  a  connection-mode  transport provider
       offering service of type T_COTS.

       s and t are file descriptors for the respective  endpoints
       on  calls  to  functions  opening  a file descriptor for a
       transport endpoint.

       /dev/ticotsord is typically invoked as the implied  device
       in  a call to socket or as the first argument in a call to
       t_open and is used to identify the transport protocol that
       will supply a connection-based transport service.

       The  device known as /dev/ticotsord is a ``loopback trans-
       port provider,'' that is, a  stand-alone  network  at  the
       transport level.  Loopback devices are transport providers
       in every sense  except  one:  only  one  host  (the  local
       machine) is ``connected to'' a loopback network.

       /dev/ticotsord  may  be  used  as a clone device to find a
       minor available device for the transport  user.   It  pre-
       sents  a TPI (STREAMS-level) interface to application pro-
       cesses and is intended to  be  accessed  via  the  TLI  or
       socket (application-level) interface.  It supports address
       spaces consisting of ``flex-addresses,''  that  is,  arbi-
       trary sequences of octets, of length > 0, represented by a
       netbuf structure, described in

       Loopback transports support a local IPC mechanism  through
       the  TLI and sockets interfaces.  Applications implemented
       in a transport provider-independent manner  on  a  client-
       server  model  using  this  IPC  are  transparently trans-
       portable to networked environments.

       /dev/ticotsord supports the  same  service  type  (T_COTS)
       supported  by the OSI transport-level model and its use is
       encouraged.

       The value returned by a call  to  open  an  endpoint  with
       /dev/ticotsord  is  a  file  descriptor characterizing the
       endpoint.
