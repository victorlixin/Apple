       These drivers are used as the transport mechanism, or more
       appropriately the  interprocess  communication  mechanism,
       for  processes  communicating  in the  domain. Two drivers
       exist: one provides connectionless service and  the  other
       provides connection oriented service. Both the drivers are
       loopback-TLI  streams  drivers.  The  socket  driver  (see
       passes  data  from the user to the  domain sockets drivers
       which in turn pass the data back to the socket  driver  as
       appropriate.

       The  systemwide number of  domain sockets is controlled by
       the  value  of  the  third  field  (unit)  in   the   file
       /etc/conf/sdevice.d/ticots.  Changes to this file will not
       take effect until you rebuild and  reboot  the  system  as
       described in
