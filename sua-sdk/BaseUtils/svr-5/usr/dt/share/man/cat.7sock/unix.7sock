       The   domain  sockets  facility provides for communication
       between  processes  running  on  the  same  system.   Both
       SOCK_STREAM    and   SOCK_DGRAM   types   are   supported.
       SOCK_STREAM provides for reliable communication.  In  most
       cases SOCK_DGRAM communication is also reliable because of
       the absence of a communication  medium,  however,  use  of
       SOCK_STREAM is encouraged.

        domain  addresses are pathnames. In other words, two pro-
       cesses can communicate by specifying the same pathname  as
       their  communications rendezvous point.  The function cre-
       ates an entry in the filesystem for  the  pathname  speci-
       fied.   If the pathname already exists, the bind call will
       fail.

       Sockets in the  domain protocol family use  the  following
       addressing structure: struct sockaddr_un {
           u_char    sun_len;
           u_char    sun_family;
           u_short    sun_path[108];  }; To create or reference a
       domain socket, the sun_len field  should  be  set  to  the
       length  of  the sockaddr_un structure or the length of the
       structure containing valid information (that is, up to and
       including  the  terminating  zero  byte  in sun_path). The
       sun_family field should be set to AF_UNIX and the sun_path
       array  should contain the path name of a rendezvous point.

       Since there are no protocol numbers associated with domain
       sockets,  the  protocol argument to the socket call should
       be zero.

       Closing a  domain socket  does  not  make  the  filesystem
       entry  go  away;  an  application  should remove the entry
       using when finished.

       In &geminiREL; the sockaddr structure has been modified to
       support  variable  length  sockets. The net result of this
       modification is that the family member has been  shortened
       to 8 bits and a new 8-bit member inserted before it called
       len. For more information on the new sockaddr  structures,
       see also:
