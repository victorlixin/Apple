       free_octetstring  frees  all  memory  associated  with  an
       OctetString data structure, including the memory allocated
       to the individual octets.

       make_octet_from_hex  converts  a  hex  text  string into a
       library format OctetString data structure for use by calls
       to  and  The  format of these strings is a hex value (1 or
       more hex digits, upper or lower case) followed by a space,
       with  more  hex  values and spaces to complete the string.
       For example, to create an OctetString of length two with a
       hex  15  in  the  first  octet  and a hex 3D in the second
       octet, the text  string  could  be  ``15  3d''  or  ``0x15
       0x3D''.  The  OctetString  construct returned by this call
       can be freed by a call to free_octetstring. Usually,  this
       is  unnecessary  as  the construct is most often passed to
       another library routine for inclusion in  a  larger  ASN.1
       construct,  and  that library's free counterpart will per-
       form the memory recovery.

       make_octetstring produces a library OctetString  construct
       from  an  input  byte string and length. This construct is
       usually  passed  to   other   library   calls,   such   as
       make_varbind  or  make_authentication,  and  linked into a
       larger library construct of an ASN.1  entity.  free_octet-
       string  recovers all memory malloc'ed by make_octetstring,
       but should not be used if the OctetString is is passed  to
       another  library routine. The free_* counterparts to those
       routines free up all memory that has been  linked  to  the
       higher level ASN.1 structure.

       make_octet_from_text  is  used  to create a library format
       OctetString  data  structure   for   use   by   calls   to
       make_varbind and make_authentication from text strings.

                                                                1

       If  an OctetString's value contains only printable charac-
       ters, print_ascii prints out the value's  contents  as  an
       ASCII  string.  It  is called with a pointer to the Octet-
       String construct and checks if the string is printable. If
       it isn't printable, print_ascii returns a -1 value; other-
       wise it returns 1.

       print_octet_string_out  prints  out  the  contents  of  an
       OctetString's value in hex. It is called with a pointer to
       the OctetString construct and the number of bytes to  dis-
       play on one line (the variable wrap). This call is used by
       the routine to actually print out OctetString values.
