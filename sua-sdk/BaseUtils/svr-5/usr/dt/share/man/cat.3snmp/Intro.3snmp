       This  manual  page section describes the functions defined
       in the SNMP header files <snmp/snmp.h>,  <snmp/snmpuser.h>
       and  <snmp/snmpio.h>.  These  functions  are  used  in the
       implementation of applications that will use the SNMP mul-
       tiplexing  (SMUX)  protocol to communicate with a &gemini;
       SNMP agent. The supplied functions for handling  authenti-
       cation,  object identifiers, octet strings, variable bind-
       ings and traps are also described.
