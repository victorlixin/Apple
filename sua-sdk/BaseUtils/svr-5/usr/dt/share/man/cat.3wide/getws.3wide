       getws  reads  EUC  characters from stdin, converts them to
       wchar_t characters, and places them in the  wchar_t  array
       pointed to by s.  getws reads until a newline character is
       read or an end-of-file condition is encountered.  The new-
       line character is discarded and the wchar_t string is ter-
       minated with a wchar_t null character.

       If end-of-file or a read error is encountered and no char-
       acters  have  been  transformed, no wchar_t characters are
       transferred to s and a null pointer is  returned  and  the
       error  indicator for the stream is set.  If the read error
       is an illegal byte sequence, errno is set to  EILSEQ.   If
       end-of-file  is  encountered,  the  EOF  indicator for the
       stream is set.  Otherwise, s is returned.
