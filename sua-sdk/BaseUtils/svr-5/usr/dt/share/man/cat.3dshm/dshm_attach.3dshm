       dshm_attach attaches the designated DSHM  segment  to  the
       calling  process,  placing  the map at the logical address
       assigned by and allocating and initializing the per-attach
       management data.

       Upon  successful return, *max_mappings indicates the maxi-
       mum concurrent mappings the  application  can  safely  use
       (total across all attached processes) without deadlocking.

       If  dshm_attach   returns   DSHM_NULL_HANDLE,   an   error
       occurred.  errno is set to identify the error.

       Otherwise, dshm_attach returns an opaque handle for use in
       subsequent operations on the attached segment.

       In the following conditions, dshm_attach  fails  and  sets
       errno  to: Segment is not initialized.  Initialization (by
       is still in progress or was terminated prematurely.  Ille-
       gal flags in dshmflgs.  Attach failed due to address space
       conflict.  Insufficient resources to  allocate  per-attach
       management  structure(s).   dshmid  is not a valid dynami-
       cally mapped shared memory identifier.  Operation  permis-
       sion is denied to the calling process.  The available data
       space is not large enough to accommodate the shared memory
       segment.   The  number of dynamically mapped shared memory
       segments attached to the calling process would exceed  the
       system-imposed limit.
