       The Enhanced Event Logging System (EELS) supplies two pro-
       gramming interfaces for the committing of  records  to  an
       event  database. The first of these, the Distributed Audit
       Service (XDAS) implements a four stage  record  committal:
       allocate  a record populate the record with data timestamp
       the record commit the record to the database  These  func-
       tions are described in the

       For applications requiring a generic logging interface for
       error conditions or debug information, for  example,  this
       four-stage  process  may  impose  unacceptable  overheads.
       Accordingly, the generic logging API is supplied for  sys-
       tems requiring a single-stage event record committal, sim-
       ilar to the process used by syslog or cmn_err.

       The generic logging API consists of  the  following  func-
       tions:
           Initialize an event logging session.
           Log a message.
           Close an event logging session.
       The  session descriptor returned by eels_initialise can be
       used by the XDAS functions as well as by the other generic
       logging functions.

       The  XDAS  API also supports a generic logging capability.
       For details of this, including a  list  of  the  supported
       generic logging events, see
