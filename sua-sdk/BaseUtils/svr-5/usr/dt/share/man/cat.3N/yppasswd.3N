       The  yppasswd  function  is used to change an entry in the
       Network Information Service (NIS) user password  database.

       In  order  for yppasswd to succeed, oldpass must match the
       existing (unencrypted)  password  in  the  database;  that
       password is then replaced with newpw.

       On  success,  yppasswd returns zero. Otherwise, a non-zero
       value is returned.

       If secure RPC is in operation and the user's old  password
       was  used  to  encrypt  their  secret key, re-encrypts the
       user's secret key using the new  password.   The  yppasswd
       function,  however,  does not change the encryption of the
       user's secret key.
