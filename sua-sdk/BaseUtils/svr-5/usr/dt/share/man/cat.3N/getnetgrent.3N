       getnetgrent  returns  the  next member of a network group.
       After the call, machinep  will  contain  a  pointer  to  a
       string containing the name of the machine part of the net-
       work group member, and similarly for  userp  and  domainp.
       If any of machinep, userp or domainp is returned as a NULL
       pointer, it signifies a wild card.  getnetgrent  will  use
       to  allocate  space  for the name.  This space is released
       when an endnetgrent call is made.  getnetgrent  returns  1
       if it succeeded in obtaining another member of the network
       group, 0 if it has reached the end of the group.

       getnetgrent establishes the network group from which  get-
       netgrent  will  obtain members, and also restarts calls to
       getnetgrent from the beginning of the list.  If the previ-
       ous  setnetgrent  call was to a different network group, a
       endnetgrent call is implied.  endnetgrent frees the  space
       allocated during the getnetgrent calls.  innetgr returns 1
       or 0, depending on whether netgroup contains the (machine,
       user,  domain)  triple  as  a  member.   Any  of the three
       strings machine, user, or domain can  be  NULL,  in  which
       case it signifies a wild card.

       The Network Information Service (NIS) must be running when
       using getnetgrent, since it only inspects the NIS netgroup
       map, never the local files.

       The  Network  Information Service (NIS) was formerly known
       as Sun Yellow Pages (YP).  The functionality  of  the  two
       remains the same; only the name has changed.
