       An  interface  index  is a small positive integer (greater
       than 0) that is used to identify the  local  interface  on
       which  a  multicast  group  is joined.  It is also used to
       identify the interface on which a datagram is received, or
       to  specify  the  interface  on  which a datagram is to be
       sent.

       if_nametoindex maps an interface name into its correspond-
       ing  index.  It  returns 0 if the specified interface does
       not exist.

       if_indextoname maps an interface  index  into  its  corre-
       sponding name. The name argument must point to a buffer of
       at least IFNAMSIZ bytes which is used to hold the returned
       interface  name  (including a terminating null character).
       This pointer is also the return value of the function.  If
       there  is  not  interface  corresponding  to the specified
       index, if_indextoname returns NULL.

       if_nameindex returns an array of if_nameindex  structures,
       one  structure per interface. An if_nameindex structure is
       defined as follows: struct  if_nameindex  {       unsigned
       int  if_index; /* 1, 2, ... */      char     *if_name;  /*
       null-terminated name */ }; The end of the array of  struc-
       tures  is  indicated  by a structure with an if_index of 0
       and an if_name  of  NULL.   if_nameindex  returns  a  NULL
       pointer on error.  The memory used for the array of struc-
       tures and if_name members is obtained dynamically.

       if_freenameindex frees the dynamic memory that  was  allo-
       cated  by if_nameindex. The argument ptr must be a pointer
       that was previously returned by if_nameindex.
