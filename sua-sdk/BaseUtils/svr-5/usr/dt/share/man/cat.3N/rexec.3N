       rexec looks up the host  ahost  using  gethostbyname  (see
       returning -1 if the host does not exist.  Otherwise, ahost
       is set to the standard name of the host.   The  parameters
       are:  points  to  the pointer for the host well-known port
       used for this connection; this must  be  in  network  byte
       order  points  to the user name points to the password for
       the specified user name points to the command to  be  exe-
       cuted  points to the descriptor for the control process If
       a username and password are both specified, then these are
       used  to  authenticate to the foreign host; otherwise, the
       .netrc file in the user's home directory is  searched  for
       appropriate  information.   If  this  fails,  the  user is
       prompted for the information.

       The port inport specifies which well-known DARPA  Internet
       port  to use for the connection.  The protocol for connec-
       tion is described in detail in rexecd.

       If the call succeeds, a  socket  of  type  SOCK_STREAM  is
       returned to the caller, and given to the remote command as
       its standard input and standard output.  If fd2p  is  non-
       zero,  then an auxiliary channel to a control process will
       be set up, and a descriptor for it will be placed in fd2p.
       The control process will return diagnostic output from the
       command (unit 2) on this channel,  and  will  also  accept
       bytes  on  this channel as signal numbers, to be forwarded
       to the process group of the command.  If fd2p is  0,  then
       the  standard error (unit 2 of the remote command) will be
       made the same as its standard output and no  provision  is
       made  for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process,
       although you may be able to get  its  attention  by  using
       out-of-band data.

       There is no way to specify options to the socket call that
       rexec makes.
