       These routines convert 16 and 32  bit  quantities  between
       network byte order and host byte order.  On some architec-
       tures these routines are defined as  NULL  macros  in  the
       include  file  netinet/in.h.   On  other architectures, if
       their host byte  order  is  different  from  network  byte
       order, these routines are functional.

       These  routines  are  most  often used in conjunction with
       Internet addresses and ports as returned by and
