       the  file  descriptor  for the stream.  points to the file
       containing configuration information.  bitmask that  iden-
       tifies the script mode.

       doconfig  is  a  Service  Access Facility library function
       that interprets the configuration scripts contained in the
       files   /etc/saf/pmtag/_config,  /etc/saf/_sysconfig,  and
       /etc/saf/pmtag/svctag.

       script is the name of the configuration script;  fd  is  a
       file descriptor that designates the stream to which stream
       manipulation operations are to be applied; rflag is a bit-
       mask  that  indicates  the  mode  in which script is to be
       interpreted.  rflag may take two values, NORUN  and  NOAS-
       SIGN, which may be or'd.

       If  rflag  is  0, all commands in the configuration script
       are eligible to be interpreted.

       If rflag has the NOASSIGN bit set, the assign  command  is
       considered illegal and will generate an error return.

       If  rflag  has the NORUN bit set, the run and runwait com-
       mands are  considered  illegal  and  will  generate  error
       returns.

       Script files consist of lines up to a maximum 1024 charac-
       ters containing a sequence of commands.  Each  command  is
       interpreted  separately.   The following reserved keywords
       are defined: assign, push, pop,  runwait,  and  run.   The
       comment  character is #; when a # occurs on a line, every-
       thing from that point to the end of the line  is  ignored.
       Blank  lines are not significant.  Used to define environ-
       ment variables.  variable is the name of  the  environment
       variable and value is the value to be assigned to it.  The
       value assigned must be  a  string  constant;  no  form  of
       parameter substitution is available.  value may be quoted.
       The quoting rules are those used by the shell for defining
       environment  variables.   assign will fail if space cannot
       be allocated for the new variable or if any  part  of  the
       specification  is  invalid.   Used to push STREAMS modules
       onto the stream designated by fd.  module1 is the name  of
       the  first module to be pushed, module2 is the name of the
       second module to be pushed, and so on.  The  command  will
       fail  if  any of the named modules cannot be pushed.  If a
       module cannot be pushed, the  subsequent  modules  on  the

                                                                1

       same  command  line  will be ignored and modules that have
       already been pushed will be popped.  Used to  pop  STREAMS
       modules off the designated stream.  If pop is invoked with
       no arguments, the top module on the stream is popped.   If
       an argument is given, modules will be popped one at a time
       until the named module is at the top of  the  stream.   If
       the  named  module  is  not  on the designated stream, the
       stream is left as it was and the command fails.  If module
       is the special keyword ALL, then all modules on the stream
       will be popped.  Note that only modules above the  topmost
       driver  are  affected.  The runwait command runs a command
       and waits for it to complete.  command is the pathname  of
       the   command   to  be  run.   The  command  is  run  with
       /usr/bin/sh -c prepended to it; shell scripts may thus  be
       executed  from configuration scripts.  The runwait command
       will fail if command cannot be found  or  cannot  be  exe-
       cuted,  or  if  command exits with a non-zero status.  The
       run command is identical to runwait except  that  it  does
       not wait for command to complete.  command is the pathname
       of the command to be run.  run will not fail unless it  is
       unable to create a child process to execute the command.

       Although they are syntactically indistinguishable, some of
       the commands available to run and runwait are  interpreter
       built-in commands.  Interpreter built-ins are used when it
       is necessary to alter the state of a  process  within  the
       context  of that process.  The doconfig interpreter built-
       in commands are similar to the shell special commands and,
       like  these,  they do not spawn another process for execu-
       tion.  See The initial set of  built-in  commands  is:  cd
       ulimit umask

       When  a  script  fails,  the process whose environment was
       being established should not be started.

       doconfig returns 0 if the script was interpreted  success-
       fully.   If a command in the script fails, the interpreta-
       tion of the script ceases at that  point  and  a  positive
       number  is  returned;  this number indicates which line in
       the script failed.  If a system error occurs, a  value  of
       -1 is returned.
