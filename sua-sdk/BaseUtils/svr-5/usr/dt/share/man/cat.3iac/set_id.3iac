       The set_id routine sets the user's identity which consists
       of user ID, group ID, supplemental group  IDs,  and  audit
       mask (if the Auditing Utilities are installed).

       The  routine  checks the value of namep to determine where
       to get the above information; if namep is  non-NULL  (that
       is,  a  login  name), then it is used with the ia_openinfo
       routine to access namep's information from the  /etc/secu-
       rity/ia/master file.

       If  namep  is NULL then the information is assumed to have
       been passed  via  the  Identification  and  Authentication
       Facility module and is retrieved via the getava routine.
