       post_form  writes form into its associated subwindow.  The
       application programmer must use curses library routines to
       display   the   form   on  the  physical  screen  or  call
       update_panels if the panels library is being used.

       unpost_form erases form from its associated subwindow.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT    -   An argument is incorrect.
       E_POSTED          -   The form is posted.
       E_NOT_POSTED      -   The form is not posted.
       E_NO_ROOM         -   The form does not fit in the subwindow.
       E_BAD_STATE       -   The routine was called from an initialization
                             or termination function.
