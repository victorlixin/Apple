       With  the  scr_dump  routine,  the current contents of the
       virtual screen are written to the file filename.

       With the scr_restore routine, the virtual screen is set to
       the  contents  of  filename,  which must have been written
       using scr_dump.  The next call to  doupdate  restores  the
       screen to the way it looked in the dump file.

       With  the  scr_init  routine, the contents of filename are
       read in and used to initialize the curses data  structures
       about  what  the terminal currently has on its screen.  If
       the data is determined to be valid, curses bases its  next
       update  of  the  screen  on  this  information rather than
       clearing the screen and starting from  scratch.   scr_init
       is  used  after initscr or a system [see call to share the
       screen with another process  which  has  done  a  scr_dump
       after  its  endwin  call.  The data is declared invalid if
       the time-stamp of the tty is old or the terminfo capabili-
       ties rmcup and nrrmc exist.

       The  scr_set  routine  is a combination of scr_restore and
       scr_init.  It tells the program that  the  information  in
       filename is what is currently on the screen, and also what
       the program wants on the screen.  This can be  thought  of
       as a screen inheritance function.

       To  read (write) a window from (to) a file, use the getwin
       and putwin routines [see

       All routines return the integer ERR upon  failure  and  OK
       upon success.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note  that  scr_init,  scr_set,  and  scr_restore  may  be
       macros.
