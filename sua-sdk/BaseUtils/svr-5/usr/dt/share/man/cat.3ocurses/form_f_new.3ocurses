       new_field creates a new field with r rows and  c  columns,
       starting  at frow, fcol, in the subwindow of a form.  nrow
       is the number of off-screen rows and nbuf is the number of
       additional   working  buffers.   This  routine  returns  a
       pointer to the new field.

       dup_field duplicates field at the specified location.  All
       field  attributes  are  duplicated,  including the current
       contents of the field buffers.

       link_field also duplicates field at  the  specified  loca-
       tion.  However, unlike dup_field, the new field shares the
       field buffers with the original  field.   After  creation,
       the  attributes  of  the  new field can be changed without
       affecting the original field.

       free_field frees the storage allocated for field.

       Routines  that  return  pointers  return  NULL  on  error.
       free_field returns one of the following:
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
       E_OK             -   The function returned successfully.
       E_CONNECTED      -   The field is already connected to a form.
       E_SYSTEM_ERROR   -   System error.
       E_BAD_ARGUMENT   -   An argument is incorrect.
