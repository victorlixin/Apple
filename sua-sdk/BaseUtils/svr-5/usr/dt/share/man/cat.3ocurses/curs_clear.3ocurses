       The erase and werase routines copy blanks to  every  posi-
       tion in the window.

       The  clear  and wclear routines are like erase and werase,
       but they also call clearok, so that the screen is  cleared
       completely  on  the  next call to wrefresh for that window
       and repainted from scratch.

       The clrtobot and wclrtobot routines erase all lines  below
       the  cursor  in the window.  Also, the current line to the
       right of the cursor, inclusive, is erased.

       The clrtoeol and wclrtoeol routines erase the current line
       to the right of the cursor, inclusive.

       All  routines  return  the  integer  OK, or a non-negative
       integer if immedok is set.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that erase, werase, clear, wclear, clrtobot, and clr-
       toeol may be macros.
