       The  UNIX(R)  System  V  Release  4  (SVR4) curses library
       (/usr/lib/libocurses.a) routines give the user a terminal-
       independent method of updating character screens with rea-
       sonable optimization.  This is the standard curses library
       delivered  with  &geminiREL;  and  earlier  versions;  see
       ``Standards compliance'', below.

       A program using these routines must be compiled  with  the
       -locurses option of

       The  curses  package  provides: overall screen, window and
       pad manipulation; output to windows and pads; reading ter-
       minal  input;  control  over terminal and curses input and
       output options; environment query routines; color  manipu-
       lation;  use  of  soft  label  keys; terminfo access; and,
       access to low-level curses routines.  See for  a  list  of
       routines and other information.

       For  descriptions  of the form, menu, and panel libraries,
       see and These libraries  will  work  only  with  the  SVR4
       libocurses  library;   they do not function correctly with
       the POSIX libcurses libraries.

       The SVR4 libocurses library  is  succeeded  by  the  POSIX
       curses library in libcurses;  see the
