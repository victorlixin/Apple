       The scanw, wscanw and mvscanw routines correspond to scanf
       [see The effect of these routines  is  as  though  wgetstr
       were  called on the window, and the resulting line used as
       input for the scan.  Fields which do not map to a variable
       in the fmt field are lost.

       The vwscanw routine is similar to vwprintw in that it per-
       forms a wscanw using a variable argument list.  The  third
       argument  is  a va_list, a pointer to a list of arguments,
       as defined in varargs.h.

       vwscanw returns ERR on failure and an integer equal to the
       number of fields scanned on success.

       Applications  may  interrogate  the  return value from the
       scanw, wscanw, mvscanw and mvwscanw routines to  determine
       the number of fields which were mapped in the call.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.
