       With these routines the character under the cursor in  the
       window is deleted; all characters to the right of the cur-
       sor on the same line are moved to the  left  one  position
       and the last character on the line is filled with a blank.
       The cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x,
       if  specified).   (This does not imply use of the hardware
       delete character feature.)

       All routines return the integer ERR upon  failure  and  an
       integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that delch, mvdelch, and mvwdelch may be macros.
