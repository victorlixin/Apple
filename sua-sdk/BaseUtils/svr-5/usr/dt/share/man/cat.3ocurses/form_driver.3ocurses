       form_driver  is  the  workhorse of the forms subsystem; it
       checks to determine whether the character  c  is  a  forms
       request or data.  If it is a request, the form driver exe-
       cutes the request and reports the result.  If it  is  data
       (a printable ASCII character), it enters the data into the
       current position in the current field.  If it is not  rec-
       ognized,  the  form  driver  assumes it is an application-
       defined command and returns  E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND.   Applica-
       tion  defined  commands  should  be  defined  relative  to
       MAX_COMMAND, the maximum value of a request listed  below.
