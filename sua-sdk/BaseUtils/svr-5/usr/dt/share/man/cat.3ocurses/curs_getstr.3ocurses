       The effect of getstr is as though a  series  of  calls  to
       getch  were  made,  until  a newline or carriage return is
       received.  The resulting  value  is  placed  in  the  area
       pointed  to  by the character pointer str.  wgetnstr reads
       at most n characters, thus preventing a possible  overflow
       of the input buffer.  The user's erase and kill characters
       are interpreted, as well as  any  special  keys  (such  as
       function keys, ``home'' key, ``clear'' key, and so on).

       All  routines  return  the integer ERR upon failure and an
       integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that getstr, mvgetstr, and mvwgetstr may be macros.
