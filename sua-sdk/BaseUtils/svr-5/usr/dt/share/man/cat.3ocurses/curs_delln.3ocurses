       With  the  deleteln and wdeleteln routines, the line under
       the cursor in the window is deleted; all lines  below  the
       current  line  are  moved up one line.  The bottom line of
       the window is  cleared.   The  cursor  position  does  not
       change.   (This  does  not  imply use of a hardware delete
       line feature.)

       With the insdelln and winsdelln routines, for positive  n,
       insert n lines into the specified window above the current
       line.  The n bottom  lines  are  lost.   For  negative  n,
       delete  n  lines (starting with the one under the cursor),
       and move the remaining lines up.  The bottom n  lines  are
       cleared.  The current cursor position remains the same.

       With  the  insertln and insertln routines, a blank line is
       inserted above the current line and  the  bottom  line  is
       lost.   (This does not imply use of a hardware insert line
       feature.)

       All routines return the integer ERR upon  failure  and  an
       integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that all but winsdelln may be a macros.
