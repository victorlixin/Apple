       All of these routines manipulate the current attributes of
       the  named window.  The current attributes of a window are
       applied to all characters that are written into the window
       with  waddch, waddstr and wprintw.  Attributes are a prop-
       erty of the character, and move with the character through
       any scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations.
       To the extent possible on the  particular  terminal,  they
       are  displayed  as the graphic rendition of characters put
       on the screen.

       The routine attrset sets the  current  attributes  of  the
       given  window to attrs.  The routine attroff turns off the
       named attributes without turning any other  attributes  on
       or  off.  The routine attron turns on the named attributes
       without affecting any others.  The routine standout is the
       same  as  attron(A_STANDOUT).  The routine standend is the
       same as attrset(0), that is, it turns off all  attributes.
