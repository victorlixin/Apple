       curses manipulates the set  of  soft  function-key  labels
       that exist on many terminals.  For those terminals that do
       not have soft labels, curses takes over the bottom line of
       stdscr,  reducing  the  size  of  stdscr  and the variable
       LINES.  curses standardizes on eight labels of up to eight
       characters each.

       To  use  soft  labels, the slk_init routine must be called
       before initscr or newterm is called.  If  initscr  eventu-
       ally  uses  a line from stdscr to emulate the soft labels,
       then fmt determines how the labels  are  arranged  on  the
       screen.  Setting fmt to 0 indicates a 3-2-3 arrangement of
       the labels; 1 indicates a 4-4 arrangement.

       With the slk_set routine, labnum is the label number, from
       1 to 8.  label is the string to be put on the label, up to
       eight characters in length.   A  null  string  or  a  null
       pointer  sets up a blank label.  fmt is either 0, 1, or 2,
       indicating whether the label is to be left-justified, cen-
       tered, or right-justified, respectively, within the label.

       The slk_refresh and slk_noutrefresh routines correspond to
       the wrefresh and wnoutrefresh routines.

       With  the  slk_label  routine, the current label for label
       number labnum is returned with leading and trailing blanks
       stripped.

       With  the  slk_clear  routine, the soft labels are cleared
       from the screen.

       With the slk_restore routine, the soft labels are restored
       to the screen after a slk_clear is performed.

       With the slk_touch routine, all the soft labels are forced
       to be output the next time a slk_noutrefresh is performed.

       The  slk_attron, slk_attrset and slk_attroff routines cor-
       respond to attron, attrset, and  attroff.   They  have  an
       effect  only  if  soft  labels are simulated on the bottom
       line of the screen.

                                                                1

       Routines that return an integer return  ERR  upon  failure
       and  an  integer value other than ERR upon successful com-
       pletion.

       slk_label returns NULL on error.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Most applications would use slk_noutrefresh because a wre-
       fresh is likely to follow soon.
