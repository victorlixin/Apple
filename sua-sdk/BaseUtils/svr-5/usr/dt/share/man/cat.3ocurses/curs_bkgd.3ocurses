       The  bkgdset  and  wbkgdset  routines manipulate the back-
       ground of the named window.  Background is a  chtype  con-
       sisting  of any combination of attributes and a character.
       The attribute part of the background  is  combined  (ORed)
       with  all  non-blank  characters that are written into the
       window with waddch.   Both  the  character  and  attribute
       parts  of the background are combined with the blank char-
       acters.  The background becomes a property of the  charac-
       ter and moves with the character through any scrolling and
       insert/delete line/character operations.   To  the  extent
       possible  on  a particular terminal, the attribute part of
       the background is displayed as the  graphic  rendition  of
       the character put on the screen.

       The  bkgd  and  wbkgd  routines combine the new background
       with every position in the window.  Background is any com-
       bination   of   attributes  and  a  character.   Only  the
       attribute part is used to set the background of  non-blank
       characters,  while  both character and attributes are used
       for blank positions.  To the extent possible on a particu-
       lar terminal, the attribute part of the background is dis-
       played as the graphic rendition of the  character  put  on
       the screen.
