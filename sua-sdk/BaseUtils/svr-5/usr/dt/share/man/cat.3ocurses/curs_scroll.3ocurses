       With the scroll routine, the window  is  scrolled  up  one
       line.   This  involves moving the lines in the window data
       structure.  As an optimization, if the scrolling region of
       the  window  is  the entire screen, the physical screen is
       scrolled at the same time.

       With the scrl and wscrl routines, for  positive  n  scroll
       the  window  up  n  lines  (line i+n becomes i); otherwise
       scroll the window down n lines.  This involves moving  the
       lines  in  the window character image structure.  The cur-
       rent cursor position is not changed.

       For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via
       scrollok.

       All  routines  return  the integer ERR upon failure and an
       integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that scrl and scroll may be macros.
