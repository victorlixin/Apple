       These routines insert a character string (as many  charac-
       ters  as  will fit on the line) before the character under
       the cursor.  All characters to the right of the cursor are
       moved  to the right, with the possibility of the rightmost
       characters on the line being lost.   The  cursor  position
       does  not  change  (after  moving  to y, x, if specified).
       (This does not imply use of the hardware insert  character
       feature.)   The  four routines with n as the last argument
       insert at most n characters.  If  n<=0,  then  the  entire
       string is inserted.

       If  a character in str is a tab, newline, carriage return,
       or backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately within the
       window.   A  newline  also  does a clrtoeol before moving.
       Tabs are considered to be at every eighth  column.   If  a
       character in str is another control character, it is drawn
       in the ^X notation.  Calling winch after adding a  control
       character (and moving to it, if necessary) does not return
       the control character, but instead returns the representa-
       tion of the control character.

       All  routines  return  the integer ERR upon failure and an
       integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that all but winsnstr may be macros.
