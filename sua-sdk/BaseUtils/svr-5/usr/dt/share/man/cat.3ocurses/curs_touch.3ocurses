       The  touchwin  and touchline routines throw away all opti-
       mization information about which parts of the window  have
       been  touched,  by  pretending  that the entire window has
       been drawn on.  This is  sometimes  necessary  when  using
       overlapping  windows, since a change to one window affects
       the other window, but the records of which lines have been
       changed  in  the  other  window do not reflect the change.
       The routine touchline only pretends that count lines  have
       been changed, beginning with line start.

       The  untouchwin  routine  marks all lines in the window as
       unchanged since the last call to wrefresh.

       The wtouchln routine makes n lines in the window, starting
       at  line  y,  look as if they have (changed=1) or have not
       (changed=0) been changed since the last call to  wrefresh.

       The  is_linetouched and is_wintouched routines return TRUE
       if the specified line/window was modified since  the  last
       call  to  wrefresh; otherwise they return FALSE.  In addi-
       tion, is_linetouched returns ERR if line is not valid  for
       the given window.

       All  routines  return  the integer ERR upon failure and an
       integer value other than ERR upon  successful  completion,
       unless  otherwise  noted in the preceding routine descrip-
       tions.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that all routines except wtouchln may be macros.
