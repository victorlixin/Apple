       With the border, wborder and box  routines,  a  border  is
       drawn  around the edges of the window.  The argument ls is
       a character and attributes used for the left side  of  the
       border,  rs - right side, ts - top side, bs - bottom side,
       tl - top left-hand corner, tr - top right-hand corner,  bl
       - bottom left-hand corner, and br - bottom right-hand cor-
       ner.  If any of these arguments is zero, then the  follow-
       ing   default  values  (defined  in  ocurses.h)  are  used
       instead:  ACS_VLINE,  ACS_VLINE,   ACS_HLINE,   ACS_HLINE,
       ACS_ULCORNER, ACS_URCORNER, ACS_LLCORNER, ACS_LRCORNER.

       box(win,  verch,  horch)  is a shorthand for the following
       call: wborder(win, verch, verch, horch, horch, 0, 0, 0, 0)

       hline  and  whline  draw a horizontal (left to right) line
       using ch starting at the current cursor  position  in  the
       window.   The current cursor position is not changed.  The
       line is at most n characters long, or as many as fit  into
       the window.

       vline  and  wvline  draw  a  vertical (top to bottom) line
       using ch starting at the current cursor  position  in  the
       window.   The current cursor position is not changed.  The
       line is at most n characters long, or as many as fit  into
       the window.

       All  routines  return  the  integer  OK, or a non-negative
       integer if immedok is set.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that border and box may be macros.
