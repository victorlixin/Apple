       These  routines insert a wchar_t character string (as many
       wchar_t characters as will fit on  the  line)  before  the
       character  under  the cursor.  All characters to the right
       of the cursor are moved to the right, with the possibility
       of  the  rightmost characters on the line being lost.  The
       cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x,  if
       specified).   (This  does  not  imply  use of the hardware
       insert character feature.)  The four routines  with  n  as
       the last argument insert at most n wchar_t characters.  If
       n<=0, then the entire string is inserted.

       If a character in wstr is a tab, newline, carriage return,
       or backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately within the
       window.  A newline also does  a  clrtoeol  before  moving.
       Tabs  are  considered  to be at every eighth column.  If a
       character in wstr is  another  control  character,  it  is
       drawn  in  the  ^X notation.  Calling winch after adding a
       control character (and moving to it,  if  necessary)  does
       not  return the control character, but instead returns the
       representation of the control character.

       All routines return the integer ERR upon  failure  and  an
       integer value other than ERR upon successful completion.

       The  header  file  ocurses.h  automatically  includes  the
       header files stdio.h and unctrl.h.

       Note that all but winsnwstr may be macros.
