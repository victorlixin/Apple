       The following functions are defined for complex, where:
        -- d, m, and a are of type integer and
        --  x  and  y  are of type complex.  Returns the absolute
       value or magnitude of x.  Returns the square of the magni-
       tude  of  x.   It  is  faster than abs, but more likely to
       cause an overflow error.  It is intended for comparison of
       magnitudes.   Returns  the angle of x, measured in radians
       in the range --n to -n.  Returns the complex conjugate of x.
       That  is,  if  x  is  (real, imag), then conj(x) is (real,
       -imag).  Creates a complex given a pair of  polar  coordi-
       nates,  magnitude  m,  and  angle  a, measured in radians.
       Returns the real part of x.  Returns the imaginary part of
       x.
