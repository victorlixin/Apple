       Operations on a stdiobuf are reflected in  the  associated
       FILE.  A stdiobuf is constructed in unbuffered mode, which
       causes all operations to be reflected immediately  in  the
       FILE.  seekg()s and seekp()s are translated into fseek()s.
       setbuf() has its usual meaning; if it supplies  a  reserve
       area, buffering will be turned back on.

UUssaaggee
       stdiobuf  is  intended  to  be  used when mixing C and C++
       code.  New C++ code should prefer to use  filebufs,  which
       have better performance.
