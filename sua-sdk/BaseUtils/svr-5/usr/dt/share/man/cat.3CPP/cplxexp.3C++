       The following math functions are overloaded by the complex
       library, where:
        -- x, y, and z are of type complex.  Returns ex.  Returns
       the natural logarithm of  x.   Returns  xy.   Returns  the
       square  root  of x, contained in the first or fourth quad-
       rants of the complex plane.

       exp returns (0, 0) when the real part of x is so small, or
       the  imaginary  part  is  so  large, as to cause overflow.
       When the real part is large enough to cause overflow,  exp
       returns  (HUGE, HUGE) if the cosine and sine of the imagi-
       nary part of x are positive, (HUGE, -HUGE) if  the  cosine
       is positive and the sine is not, (-HUGE, HUGE) if the sine
       is positive and the cosine is not, and (-HUGE,  -HUGE)  if
       neither  sine nor cosine is positive.  In all these cases,
       errno is set to ERANGE.

       log returns (-HUGE, 0) and sets errno to EDOM  when  x  is
       (0, 0).

       These  error-handling  procedures  may be changed with the
       function
