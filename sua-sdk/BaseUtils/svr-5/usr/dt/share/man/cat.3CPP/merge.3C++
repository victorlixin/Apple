       (1)  For  the  plain version, T::operator< defines a total
       ordering relation on T and the array is sorted w.r.t. that
       relation.

       (2) For the relational version, rel defines a total order-
       ing relation on T and the  array  is  sorted  w.r.t.  that
       relation.

       (3)  The  output  array does not overlap either of the two
       input arrays.

       (4) The output array has at least as many  cells  as  both
       input arrays combined.

       (5) T has operator=.

       These  functions stably combine the elements of two sorted
       arrays into a new sorted array.  template <class  T>  void
       merge(
           const T* b1, const T* e1,
           const T* b2, const T* e2,
           T* b3
           );

       Uses  T::operator<  to define the ordering relation.  tem-
       plate <class T> void merge_r(
           int (*rel)(const T*, const T*),
           const T* b1, const T* e1,
           const T* b2, const T* e2,
           T* b3
           );

       Uses rel to define the ordering relation.

       If N and M are the sizes of the two arrays, then  complex-
       ity is O(N+M).   At most N+M-1 tests of the ordering rela-
       tion and N+M assignments are done.

       Because a Block (see Block(3C++)) can always be used wher-
       ever  an array is called for, Array Algorithms can also be

       actually designed to be used together.
