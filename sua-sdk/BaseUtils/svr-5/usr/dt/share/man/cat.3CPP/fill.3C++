       Assigns the value val to every location in the array.

       If  N  is  the size of the array, then complexity is O(N).
       Exactly N assignments are done.

       Because a Block (see  Block(3C++))   can  always  be  used
       wherever an array is called for, Array Algorithms can also
       be used with Blocks.  In fact, these two  components  were
       actually designed to be used together.
