       The following trigonometric functions are defined for com-
       plex, where:
        -- x and y are of type complex.  Returns the sine  of  x.
       Returns  the  cosine of x.  Returns the hyperbolic sine of
       x.  Returns the hyperbolic cosine of x.

       If the imaginary part of x would cause overflow  sinh  and
       cosh return (0, 0).  When the real part is large enough to
       cause overflow, sinh and cosh return (HUGE, HUGE)  if  the
       cosine  and  sine of the imaginary part of x are non-nega-
       tive, (HUGE, -HUGE) if the cosine is non-negative and  the
       sine is less than 0, (-HUGE, HUGE) if the sine is non-neg-
       ative and the cosine is less than 0, and (-HUGE, -HUGE) if
       both sine and cosine are less than 0.  In all these cases,
       errno is set to ERANGE.

       These error-handling procedures may be  changed  with  the
