       Applies fun to every location in the array from the  left-
       most to the rightmost.

       If  N  is the size of the array,  then complexity is O(N).
       Exactly N calls to fun are made.

       Because a Block (see  Block(3C++))   can  always  be  used
       wherever  an  array  is  called for,  Array Algorithms can
       also be used with Blocks.   In fact, these two  components
       were actually designed to be used together.
