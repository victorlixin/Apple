       This  section  describes  functions and operators found in
       the C++ Complex Mathematics Library, libcomplex.a.   These
       functions  are  not  automatically  loaded by the C++ com-
       piler, you must specify -lcomplex -lm on  the  CC  command
       line  to link in these functions and the underlying C math
       library.  Declarations for these functions may be found in
       the #include file <complex.h>.

       The  Complex  Mathematics library implements the data type
       of complex numbers as a class, complex.  It overloads  the
       standard  input,  output, arithmetic, assignment, and com-
       parison operators, discussed in the manual  pages  for  It
       also overloads the standard exponential, logarithm, power,
       and square root functions, discussed in and  the  trigono-
       metric  functions  of  sine,  cosine, hyperbolic sine, and
       hyperbolic cosine, discussed in  for  the  class  complex.
       Routines  for converting between Cartesian and polar coor-
       dinate  systems  are  discussed  in  Error   handling   is
       described in The Complex Mathematics library also provides
       overloaded I/O operators  of  the  form:  istream&  opera-
       tor>>(istream&,   complex&)   throw();   ostream&   opera-
       tor<<(ostream&, complex) throw(); The expected  forms  for
       complex input are: f ( f ) ( f , f ) where f is a floating
       point literal, while the form for output is: ( f, f)

       Functions in the Complex Mathematics  Library  (3C++)  may
       return  the  conventional  values  (0,  0),  (0,  +-HUGE),
       (+-HUGE, 0), or (+-HUGE, +-HUGE),  when  the  function  is
       undefined for the given arguments or when the value is not
       representable.  (HUGE is the largest-magnitude single-pre-
       cision  floating-point  number  and is defined in the file
       <math.h>.  The header file <math.h>  is  included  in  the
       file  <complex.h>.)  In these cases, the external variable
       errno [see is set to the value EDOM or ERANGE.
