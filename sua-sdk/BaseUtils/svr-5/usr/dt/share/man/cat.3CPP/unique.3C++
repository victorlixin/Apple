       For the non-relational versions, T::operator== defines  an
       equivalence  relation  on T.  For the relational versions,
       rel defines an equivalence relation on T.   For  the  copy
       versions,  the  output  array  does  not overlap the input
       array.  For the copy versions, the output array has enough
       cells to hold the result.  T has operator=.

       These  functions  remove  all  but  the first element from
       every consecutive group of equal  elements  in  an  array.
       They  return  a  pointer  to  the  location after the last
       unique element.  template <class T> T* unique(T* b,T* e);

       Uses T::operator== to define equality.  template <class T>
       T* unique_c(T* b1,T* e1,T* b2);

       Like  unique  except that the input array is preserved and
       the result written to a new array  beginning  at  location
       b2.   template  <class  T>  T*  unique_r(int  (*rel)(const
       T*,const T*),T* b,T* e);

       Uses rel  to  define  equality.   template  <class  T>  T*
       unique_rc(int (*rel)(const T*,const T*),
           T* b1,T* e1,T* b2);

       Like unique_r except that the input array is preserved and
       the result written to a new array  beginning  at  location
       b2.

       If N is the size of the array, then complexity is O(N) for
       all versions.  Exactly N-1 equality tests and at most  N-2
       assignments are done.

       Because a Block (see Block(3C++)) can always be used wher-
       ever an array is called for, Array Algorithms can also  be
       used  with  Blocks.   In  fact,  these two components were
       actually designed to be used together.
