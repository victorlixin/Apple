       pthread_detach  is  used to indicate to the implementation
       that storage for the thread thread can be  reclaimed  when
       that  thread  terminates.   After pthread_detach is called
       for thread, it  is  no  longer  possible  to  successfully
       pthread_join  with  thread.  If thread has not terminated,
       pthread_detach will not cause it to terminate.  The effect
       of multiple pthread_detach calls on the same target thread
       is unspecified.

       If the call succeeds, pthread_detach  returns  0.   Other-
       wise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.

       pthread_detach  function will fail if: the value specified
       by thread does not refer to a joinable  thread  no  thread
       could  be  found  corresponding  to  that specified by the
       given thread ID
