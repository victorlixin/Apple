       pthread_condattr_getpshared  obtains the value of the pro-
       cess-shared attribute from the  attributes  object  refer-
       enced  by  attr.  The pthread_condattr_setpshared function
       is used to set the process-shared attribute in an initial-
       ized attributes object referenced by attr.

       The   process-shared  attribute  is  set  to  PTHREAD_PRO-
       CESS_SHARED to permit a condition variable to be  operated
       upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the
       condition variable is allocated,  even  if  the  condition
       variable is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple
       processes.    If   the   process-shared    attribute    is
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE,  the condition variable will only
       be operated upon by threads created within the  same  pro-
       cess  as  the  thread that initialised the condition vari-
       able; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate
       on  such a condition variable, the behaviour is undefined.
       The default value of the attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRI-
       VATE.

       If  successful,  the  pthread_condattr_setpshared function
       returns zero.  Otherwise, an error number is  returned  to
       indicate the error.

       If  successful,  the  pthread_condattr_getpshared function
       returns zero and stores the value  of  the  process-shared
       attribute  of  attr  into  the  object  referenced  by the
       pshared parameter.  Otherwise, an error number is returned
       to indicate the error.

       If  the  following  condition  is  detected,  pthread_con-
       dattr_getpshared  and  pthread_condattr_setpshared  return
       the  corresponding  value:  The value specified by attr is
       invalid.

       If  the  following  condition  is  detected,  pthread_con-
       dattr_setpshared  returns the corresponding value: The new
       value specified for the attribute is outside the range  of
       legal values for that attribute.
