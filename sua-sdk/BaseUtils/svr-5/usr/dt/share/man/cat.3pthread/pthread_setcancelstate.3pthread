       pthread_setcancelstate   atomically   sets   the   calling
       thread's cancelability state to the  indicated  state  and
       returns  the  previous cancelability state at the location
       referenced  by  oldstate.   Legal  values  for  state  are
       PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.

       pthread_setcanceltype atomically sets the calling thread's
       cancelability type to the indicated type and  returns  the
       previous  cancelability type at the location referenced by
       oldtype.   Legal  values   for   type   are   PTHREAD_CAN-
       CEL_DEFERRED and PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.

       The  cancelability  state  and  type  of any newly created
       threads, including the thread  in  which  main  was  first
       invoked,   are   PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE   and  PTHREAD_CAN-
       CEL_DEFERRED respectively.

       pthread_testcancel creates a  cancellation  point  in  the
       calling thread.  It has no effect if cancelability is dis-
       abled.

       pthread_setcancelstate  and  pthread_setcanceltype  return
       zero  on  success.  Otherwise, an error number is returned
       to indicate the error.

       pthread_setcancelstate returns the following value if  the
       corresponding  error  is  detected: The specified state is
       not PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE or PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.

       pthread_setcanceltype returns the following value  if  the
       corresponding error is detected: The specified type is not
       PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED or PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.
