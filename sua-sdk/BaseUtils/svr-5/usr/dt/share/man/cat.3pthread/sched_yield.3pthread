       sched_yield causes the calling thread to stop executing to
       allow another eligible thread of higher or equal  priority
       (if  any)  to  run.   The  calling thread will remain in a
       runnable state.  sched_yield forces the running thread  to
       relinquish  the  processor until it again becomes the head
       of its thread list.  It takes no arguments.

       This function should be viewed as a hint from  the  caller
       to  the  system,  indicating that the caller has reached a
       point at which it is convenient to yield the processor  to
       other threads.

       sched_yield  requires no special permissions or privilege.
