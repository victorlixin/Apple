       pthread_cond_signal wakes  up  a  single  thread,  if  one
       exists,     waiting     on     the     condition     cond.
       pthread_cond_broadcast wakes up all threads waiting on the
       condition  cond.   If more than one thread is waiting, the
       choice of which to  release  from  the  blocked  group  is
       scheduling  policy-specific:  Bound  threads have priority
       over multiplexed threads; then within  each  category  the
       choice of thread is scheduling-policy-specific.

       pthread_cond_signal   and  pthread_cond_broadcast  have no
       effect if there are no threads waiting on cond.

       A pthread_cond_signal or  pthread_cond_broadcast  will  be
       more  reliable  if the associated mutex used by waiters is
       held across the call.

       The condition variable denoted  by  cond  must  previously
       have been initialized (see
