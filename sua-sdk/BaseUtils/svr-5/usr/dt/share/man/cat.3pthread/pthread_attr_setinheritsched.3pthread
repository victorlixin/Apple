       pthread_attr_setinheritsched  and   pthread_attr_getinher-
       itsched,   respectively,  set  and  get  the  inheritsched
       attribute in the attr argument.

       When the attribute objects are used  by  the  inheritsched
       attribute  determines  how the other scheduling attributes
       of the created thread are to be set:  Specifies  that  the
       scheduling  policy  and  associated  attributes  are to be
       inherited from the creating  thread,  and  the  scheduling
       attributes in this attr argument are to be ignored.  Spec-
       ifies that the scheduling policy and associated attributes
       are  to  be  set  to  the  corresponding  values from this
       attribute object.

       The        symbols        PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED        and
       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED   are   defined   in   the   header
       pthread.h.

       After these attributes have been set, a thread can be cre-
       ated  with  the specified attributes using pthread_create.
       Using these routines does not affect the  current  running
       thread.

       If     successful,     pthread_attr_setinheritsched    and
       pthread_attr_getinheritsched return zero.   Otherwise,  an
       error number is returned to indicate the error.

       If     the     following    conditions    are    detected,
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched  and   pthread_attr_getinher-
       itsched    will    return    the    corresponding   value:
       _POSIX_THREAD_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING is not defined  and  the
       implementation  does  not  support  the  function  invalid
       attribute value

       If the following condition is detected,  pthread_attr_set-
       inheritsched  will  return the corresponding value: unsup-
       ported attribute value
