       pthread_rwlockattr_init   initializes  a  read-write  lock
       attributes object attr with the default value PTHREAD_PRO-

       After a read-write lock attributes object has been used to
       initialize one or  more  read-write  locks,  any  function
       affecting  the  attributes  object (including destruction)
       does not  affect  any  previously  initialized  read-write
       locks.

       pthread_rwlockattr_destroy   destroys  a  read-write  lock
       attributes object.  The effect of subsequent  use  of  the
       object  is undefined until the object is re-initialized by
       another call to pthread_rwlockattr_init.
