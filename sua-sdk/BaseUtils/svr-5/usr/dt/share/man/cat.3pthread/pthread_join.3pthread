       pthread_join  waits for termination of the undetached sib-
       ling thread designated by thread and  retrieves  the  exit
       status of the terminated thread (see

       When  the thread being waited for (thread) terminates, and
       pthread_join returns, it can be viewed that the terminated
       thread  has  joined  control  paths  with  the thread that
       called pthread_join.

       If thread is set to the thread ID of an undetached sibling
       thread,  pthread_join  waits for that thread to terminate.
       If thread is equal to (thread_t)0, pthread_join waits  for
       termination  of any undetached sibling thread, and returns
       when the first one completes pthread_exit.

       Threads created  with  the  THR_DETACHED  flag  cannot  be
       joined.

       If  status  is not NULL, the location pointed to by status
       is set to the exit  status  from  the  terminated  sibling
       thread.

       Only   one   thread   can   successfully   return  from  a
       pthread_join for a given target thread.  If more than  one
       thread  is waiting for a specific thread to terminate, one
       is successful and the others fail  with  error  indication
       ESRCH.   This  allows  exactly one thread to join with and
       obtain status from a given thread.

       If thread has already been pthread_joined, or otherwise is
       not known by the implementation, ESRCH is returned.

       The  wait in pthread_join is not broken by a signal.  If a
       thread waiting in pthread_join receives a signal  that  is
       not  masked,  if will execute the signal handler, and then
       return to waiting in pthread_join.  Note that this  behav-
       ior differs from that of pthread_cond_wait.

       pthread_join  returns zero for success and an error number
       on failure.

       If any of the following  conditions  occurs,  pthread_join
       returns  the  corresponding  value:  there  is no joinable
       (undetached) thread in the current process with thread  ID

       is (thread_t) 0,  and  there  are  no  undetached  sibling
       threads to wait for.
