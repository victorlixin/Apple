       sem_unlink  removes  the semaphore pointed to by name.  If
       name is currently  referenced  by  other  processes,  then
       sem_unlink  has  no  effect on the state of the semaphore.
       If one or more processes  have  the  semaphore  open  when
       sem_unlink  is  called,  destruction  of  the semaphore is
       postponed until all references to the semaphore have  been
       destroyed by calls to sem_close, _exit, or exec.  Calls to
       sem_open to re-create or re-connect to the semaphore refer
       to a new semaphore after sem_unlink is called.  sem_unlink
       does not block until all references have  been  destroyed;
       it returns immediately.

       sem_unlink returns 0 on success.  Otherwise, the semaphore
       is not changed and the function returns a value of -1  and
       sets errno to indicate the error.

       sem_unlink  returns the following value if the correspond-
       ing condition is detected: Permission is denied to  unlink
       the   named   semaphore.    The  length  of  name  exceeds
       {NAME_MAX} while {POSIX_NO_TRUNC} is in effect.  name does
       not exist.
