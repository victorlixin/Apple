       pthread_attr_setscope  and  pthread_attr_getscope are used
       to set and get the contentionscope attribute in  the  attr
       object.

       contentionscope  may have the values PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM,
       signifying  system   scheduling   contention   scope,   or
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS,  signifying process scheduling con-
       tention  scope.   The  symbols  PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM   and
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS are defined by the header pthread.h
