       pthread_exit  function  terminates  the calling thread and
       makes the value value_ptr available to any successful join
       with  the  terminating  thread.   Any cancellation cleanup
       handlers that have been pushed  and  not  yet  popped  are
       popped in the reverse order that they were pushed and then
       executed.  After all cancellation  cleanup  handlers  have
       been executed, if the thread has any thread-specific data,
       appropriate destructor functions  will  be  called  in  an
       unspecified  order.   Thread  termination does not release
       any application visible process resources, including,  but
       not  limited to, mutexes and file descriptors, nor does it
       perform any process level cleanup actions, including,  but
       not  limited  to,  calling  any  atexit  routines that may
       exist.

       An implicit call to pthread_exit is  made  when  a  thread
       other  than  the  thread  in  which main was first invoked
       returns from the start routine that was used to create it.
       The  function's  return  value serves as the thread's exit
       status.

       The behavior of pthread_exit is undefined if called from a
       cancellation  cleanup  handler or destructor function that
       was invoked as a result of either an implicit or  explicit
       call to pthread_exit.

       After  a  thread  has  terminated, the result of access to
       local (auto) variables of the thread is undefined.   Thus,
       references to local variables of the exiting thread should
       not be  used  for  the  pthread_exit  value_ptr  parameter
       value.

       The  process exits with an exit status of 0 after the last
       thread has been terminated.  The behaviour is  as  if  the
       implementation  called with a zero argument at thread ter-
       mination time.
