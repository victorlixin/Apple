       pthread_getschedparam and pthread_setschedparam allow  the
       scheduling  policy and scheduling parameters of individual
       threads within a multi-threaded process  to  be  retrieved
       and  set.   For SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR, the only required
       member  of  the  sched_param  structure  is  the  priority
       sched_priority.   For SCHED_OTHER, the affected scheduling
       parameters are the same.

       pthread_getschedparam retrieves the scheduling policy  and
       scheduling  parameters  for  the thread whose thread ID is
       given by thread and stores  those  values  in  policy  and
       param,  respectively.   The  priority  value returned from
       pthread_getschedparam is the value specified by  the  most
       recent  pthread_setschedparam or call affecting the target
       thread, and reflects any temporary adjustments to its pri-
       ority  as  a result of any priority inheritance or ceiling
       functions.  pthread_setschedparam sets the scheduling pol-
       icy  and  associated  scheduling parameters for the thread
       whose thread ID is given by thread to the policy and asso-
       ciated  parameters  provided  in policy and param, respec-
       tively.

       The policy  parameter  may  have  the  value  SCHED_OTHER,
       SCHED_FIFO  or  SCHED_RR,  that have the single scheduling
       parameter, sched_priority.

       If pthread_setschedparam fails, no  scheduling  parameters
       will be changed for the target thread.

       If successful, pthread_getschedparam and pthread_setsched-
       param return zero.  Otherwise, an error number is returned
       to indicate the error.

       If  the following condition is detected, pthread_getsched-
       param and pthread_setschedparam  will  return  the  corre-
       sponding  value:  value specified by thread does not refer
       to an existing thread.

       If    the    following    conditions     are     detected,
       pthread_setschedparam  will  return the corresponding val-
       ues: policy or one of the scheduling parameters associated

       with the scheduling policy policy is invalid.  attempt was
       made to set the policy  or  scheduling  parameters  to  an
       unsupported  value.   caller does not have the appropriate
       permission to set either the scheduling parameters or  the
       scheduling policy of the specified thread.
