       pthread_cancel requests that thread be canceled.  The tar-
       get thread's cancelability state and type determines  when
       the  cancellation  takes effect.  When the cancellation is
       acted on, the cancellation cleanup handlers for thread are
       called.    When  the  last  cancellation  cleanup  handler
       returns, the thread-specific data destructor functions are
       called  for  thread.   When  the  last destructor function
       returns, thread is terminated.

       The cancellation processing  in  the  target  thread  runs
       asynchronously  with respect to the calling thread return-
       ing from pthread_cancel.

       wise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
