       pthread_kill  sends  the  signal sig to the sibling thread
       thread.  If thread is blocking signal sig, the signal will
       become  pending  for  thread.   pthread_kill is the thread
       analog of

       The thread parameter is  the  thread  ID  of  the  sibling
       thread  which  is  to receive the signal.  A thread cannot
       send a signal to a thread in another process  (a  non-sib-
       ling thread).

       sig  is  the signal number of the signal to be sent and is
       either 0 or a value from the list given in  If  sig  is  0
       (the null signal), error checking is performed but no sig-
       nal is actually sent; this can be used to check the valid-
       ity of thread.

       To  maintain  integrity of the Threads Library implementa-
       tion, threads cannot send SIGLWP or SIGWAITING.

       pthread_kill returns zero on success.  Otherwise, an error
       number is returned and no signal is sent.

       pthread_kill  returns  the  following  value if the corre-
       sponding condition is detected: sig is not a valid  signal
       number  or  is either SIGLWP or SIGWAITING.  thread cannot
       be found in the current process.
