       pthread_create is  used  to  create  a  new  thread,  with
       attributes  specified  by attr, within a process.  If attr
       is NULL, the default attributes  (described on  are  used.
       If  the  attributes  specified by attr are modified later,
       the thread's attributes are not affected.  Upon successful
       completion,  pthread_create  stores  the ID of the created
       thread in the location referenced by thread.

       For PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS threads,  only  the  SCHED_OTHER
       scheduling class can be specified.

       The  thread is created executing start_routine with arg as
       its sole argument.   If  the  start_routine  returns,  the
       effect  is  as  if there was an implicit call to using the
       return value of start_routine as the  exit  status.   Note
       that  the thread in which main was originally invoked dif-
       fers from this.  When it returns from main, the effect  is
       as  if there was an implicit call to exit using the return
       value of main as the exit status.

       The signal state of the new thread is initialized as  fol-
       lows:  The  signal  mask  is  inherited  from the creating
       thread.  The set of signals pending for the new thread  is
       empty.

       If  pthread_create fails, no new thread is created and the
       contents of the location referenced by  thread  are  unde-
       fined.

       If successful, pthread_create returns zero.  Otherwise, an
       error number is returned to indicate the error.

       If  any  of  the   following   conditions   is   detected,
       pthread_create  will  return  the corresponding value: the
       system lacked the necessary resources  to  create  another
       thread  attr  is  invalid.   a scheduling class other than
       SCHED_OTHER  was  specified  for  a  PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
       thread  the caller does not have appropriate permission to
       set the required scheduling parameters or scheduling  pol-
       icy

       SCHED_OTHER  is  the  only scheduling class currently sup-
       ported for PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS threads.
