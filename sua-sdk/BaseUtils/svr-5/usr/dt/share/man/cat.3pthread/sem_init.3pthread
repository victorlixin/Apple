       sem_init initializes the unnamed semaphore sem.  Following
       a  successful  call to sem_init, the semaphore may be used
       in subsequent calls to  sem_wait,  sem_trywait,  sem_post,
       and  sem_destroy.  This semaphore remains usable until the
       semaphore is destroyed.

       sem is a pointer to an unnamed semaphore  to  be  initial-
       ized.

       If  pshared  has  a  non-zero value, then the semaphore is
       shared between processes; in this case, any  process  that
       can  access  the  semaphore sem can use sem for performing
       sem_wait, sem_trywait, sem_post,  and  sem_destroy  opera-
       tions.

       If  the  pshared  argument  is zero, then the semaphore is
       shared between threads of the process; any thread in  this
       process  can use sem for performing sem_wait, sem_trywait,
       sem_post, and sem_destroy operations.

       value specifies the value  of  the  initialized  semaphore
       value must be greater than or equal to zero.

       sem_init  returns  zero for success.  Otherwise it returns
       -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

       sem_init returns the following values if the corresponding
       condition  is  detected: value exceeds SEM_VALUE_MAX or is
       less than zero.

       Attempting to initialize an already initialized  semaphore
       results in undefined behavior.

       sem_init does not examine the sem argument before initial-
       izing it.  If sem_init is called more than  once  for  the
       same  semaphore,  it  will overwrite its state.  It is the
       user's responsibility to  ensure  that  sem_init  is  only
       called once for each semaphore.
