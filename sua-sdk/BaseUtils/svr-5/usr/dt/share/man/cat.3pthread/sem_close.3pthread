       sem_close  is used to indicate that the calling process is
       finished  using  the  named  semaphore  sem  (created   by
       sem_open).   The  effects  of  calling  sem_close  for  an
       unnamed semaphore (one created by sem_init) are undefined.

       sem_close  deallocates  any  system resources allocated by
       the system for use by this  process  for  this  semaphore.
       (That  is,  it  makes them available for reuse by a subse-
       quent sem_open by this process.)  If the semaphore has not
       been  removed  with  a successful call to sem_unlink, then
       sem_close has no effect on the state of the semaphore.  If
       sem_unlink  has  been  successfully invoked for name after
       the most recent call to sem_open with the O_CREAT flag for
       this  semaphore,  then when all processes that have opened
       the semaphore close it, the semaphore is no longer  acces-
       sible.

       sem_close  returns zero on success.  Otherwise, a value of
       -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

       sem_close returns the following value if the corresponding
       condition  is  detected:  The  sem argument is not a valid
       semaphore descriptor.
