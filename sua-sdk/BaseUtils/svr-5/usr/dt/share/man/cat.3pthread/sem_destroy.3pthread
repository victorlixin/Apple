       sem_destroy  destroys  the  semaphore  pointed  to by sem.
       This includes invalidating sem and freeing any  associated
       dynamically allocated resources.

        Only  a  semaphore  that  was  previously  initialized by
       sem_init may be destroyed using sem_destroy;

       It is safe to destroy an initialized semaphore upon  which
       no  threads are currently blocked.  The effect of destroy-
       ing a semaphore upon which  other  threads  are  currently
       blocked is undefined.

       sem_destroy  returns  zero on success.  Otherwise, a value
       of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the  error.

EErrrroorrss
       sem_destroy returns the following value if the correspond-
       ing condition is detected: The sem argument is not a valid
       semaphore.   There  are  currently  threads blocked on the
       semaphore.
