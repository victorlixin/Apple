       The Serial Line IP (SLIP) protocol is a very simple proto-
       col which allows two machines to communicate via   over  a
       serial  line. This protocol simply defines the octets nec-
       essary for framing and escaping octets in an IP packet. At
       the  sending  end, all octets in the IP packet that should
       be preceded by an escape character, will be escaped before
       sending  this  packet;  this  packet transmission will end
       with a FRAME_END octet. At the receiving end,  the  octets
       will be gathered and any escaped octets will be transposed
       (as necessary), until a FRAME_END  is  received  for  this
       packet; then the resulting packet will be passed up to IP.

       The following ioctl calls can be used to adjust the behav-
       ior  of  the  SLIP  module.   The  following  header  file
       includes the  definitions  for  these  commands:  #include
       <netinet/slip.h>  Please  note that the S_MTU ioctl is the
       only ioctl call which needs a parameter value, an integer.
       Turn  on   header  compression.  Turn off  header compres-
       sion.  Turn on automatic detection of  header  compression
       (start using compression when peer system does).  Turn off
       automatic detection of  header compression.  Do not  allow
       ICMP  packets  out on the wire.  Allow ICMP packets out on
       the wire.  Set the  ``maximum  transmission  unit''  (MTU)
       value for this interface. This request requires an integer
       as a parameter value to indicate the new MTU size.
