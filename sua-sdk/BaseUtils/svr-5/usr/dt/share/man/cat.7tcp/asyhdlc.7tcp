       The  asyhdlc  module is part of the STREAMS protocol stack
       used for PPP connections over asynchronous links.

       A PPP HDLC packet lacks a CRC checksum and uses  a  trans-
       parent  code  for data transmission.  asyhdlc performs the
       following functions on PPP datagrams: generates (on  writ-
       ing)  and validates (on reading) the CRC checksum performs
       byte stuffing to achieve data transparency by encoding (on
       writing)  and  decoding (on reading) packet data generates
       and strips the framing patterns that delimit the start and
       end  of packets adds (on writing) and removes (on reading)
       constant address and control bytes if address and  control
       compression  is  not  negotiated  while  reading, discards
       short or long packets and packets with bad checksums,  and
       notifies  PPP  to allow recovery of compressed TCP headers
       See for additional information about the  PPP  implementa-
       tion.
