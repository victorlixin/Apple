       The  Internet  protocol family is a set of protocols using
       the Internet Protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) network  layer  and
       the  Internet  address  formats  for  IPv4  and IPv6.  The
       Internet  family  provides  protocol   support   for   the
       SOCK_STREAM,  SOCK_DGRAM,  and  SOCK_RAW socket types; the
       SOCK_RAW interface provides access to the IP protocols.

       IPv4 Internet addresses are four-byte  quantities,  stored
       in    network    standard   format.   The   include   file
       <netinet/in.h> defines this address.

       Sockets bound to the IPv4 Internet protocol family use the
       following addressing structure: struct sockaddr_in {
               sa_len_t        sin_len;
               sa_family_t     sin_family;  /* AF_INET */
               in_port_t       sin_port;
               struct in_addr  sin_addr;
               unsigned  char    sin_zero[8]; }; When using sock-
       ets, the sin_port and sin_addr  fields  are  specified  in
       network order.

       Sockets  may  be created with the local address INADDR_ANY
       to affect wildcard  matching  on  incoming  messages.  The
       address  in  a  or  sendto  (see  call  may  be  given  as
       INADDR_ANY to mean this host.  The  distinguished  address
       INADDR_BROADCAST  is allowed as a shorthand for the broad-
       cast address on the primary network if the  first  network
       configured supports broadcast.

       When  using the Transport Layer Interface (TLI), transport
       providers such as support addresses  whose  length  varies
       from  eight  to sixteen bytes. The 8-byte form is the same
       as a sockaddr_in without the sin_zero field.  The  16-byte
       form is identical to sockaddr_in.

       IPv6  Internet  addresses  are  eight  16-bit  quantities,
       stored  in  network  standard  format.  The  include  file
       <netinet/in6.h> defines this address.

       Sockets bound to the IPv6 Internet protocol family use the
       following addressing structure: struct sockaddr_in6 {
               sa_len_t        sin6_len;
               sa_family_t     sin6_family;  /* AF_INET6 */
               u_int16m_t      sin6_port;

                                                                1

               u_int32m_t      sin6_flowinfo;
               struct in6_addr sin6_addr; }; When using  sockets,
       the  sin6_port,  sin6_flowinfo  and  sin6_addr  fields are
       specified in network order.  The sin6_len field  need  not
       be set before passing a socket address using or

       Sockets  may be created with the local address in6addr_any
       to affect wildcard  matching  on  incoming  messages.  The
       address  in  a  or  sendto  (see  call  may  be  given  as
       in6addr_any to mean this host.   The  IN6ADDR_*  constants
       and in6addr_* externals are defined in network byte order,
       unlike the INADDR_* constants which are  defined  in  host
       byte order.

       The  Internet protocol family is comprised of the Internet
       Protocol (IP), Internet Control Message  Protocol  (ICMP),
       Internet  Group  Management  Protocol  (IGMP) - IPv4 only,
       Transmission Control Protocol  (TCP),  and  User  Datagram
       Protocol  (UDP).   TCP  is used to support the SOCK_STREAM
       abstraction;  UDP  is  used  to  support  the   SOCK_DGRAM
       abstraction.  A raw interface to IP is available by creat-
       ing an Internet socket of type  SOCK_RAW.   The  ICMP  and
       IGMP message protocols are accessible from a raw socket.

       The 32-bit Internet address contains both network and host
       parts.  It is frequency-encoded; the most-significant  bit
       is  clear  in Class A addresses, in which the high-order 8
       bits are the network number.  Class B  addresses  use  the
       high-order  16  bits  as  the  network  field, and Class C
       addresses have a 24-bit network part.  Sites with a  clus-
       ter of local networks and a connection to the Internet may
       chose to use a single network number for the cluster; this
       is done by using subnet addressing.  The local (host) por-
       tion of the address is further subdivided into subnet  and
       host parts.  Within a subnet, each subnet appears to be an
       individual network; externally, the entire cluster appears
       to  be  a  single, uniform network requiring only a single
       routing entry.  Subnet addressing is enabled and  examined
       using  the SIOCSIFNETMASK and SIOCGIFNETMASK commands on a
       datagram socket in the Internet ``communications  domain''
       (see the description of the on the manual page).

       The  Internet protocol support is subject to change as the
       Internet protocols develop.  Users should  not  depend  on
       details of the current implementation, but rather the ser-
       vices exported.

       In &geminiREL;, the sockaddr structure has  been  modified
       to support variable length sockets. The net result of this

       modification is that the family member is now 8 bits and a
       new 8-bit member, len, has been inserted before it.
