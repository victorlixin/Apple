       UDP is a simple, unreliable datagram protocol that is used
       to  support  the  SOCK_DGRAM  abstraction for the Internet
       protocol family.  UDP sockets are connectionless, and  are
       normally used with the sendto and recvfrom calls; the call
       may also be used to fix the destination for future packets
       (in  which  case the or and or system/library calls may be
       used). In addition, UDP is available as TLI connectionless
       transport via the special file /dev/inet/udp.

       UDP address formats are identical to those used by TCP. In
       particular, UDP provides a port identifier in addition  to
       the normal Internet address format. Note that the UDP port
       space is separate from the TCP port space (that is, a  UDP
       port  may  not  be  connected to a TCP port). In addition,
       broadcast packets may be  sent  (assuming  the  underlying
       network  supports  this)  by  using  a  reserved broadcast
       address; this address is network interface dependent.

       Options at the IPv4 transport level may be used  with  UDP
       if AF_INET is specified; see Options at the IPv6 transport
       level may be used with UDP if AF_INET6 is specified; see

       The  UDP  driver  may  also  be  accessed  by  opening  it
       directly.  Network  related  statistics can be obtained by
       issuing    the    following     ioctls,     defined     in
       <netinet/ip_var.h> and <netinet/udp_var.h>, to the driver:
       to set the inpcb associated with the end-point as  a  man-
       agement inpcb (to distinguish it from others, when network
       statistics are gathered) and link it in the list  of  man-
       agement  inpcbs.  to extract UDP statistics. The structure
       udpstat is passed as an argument to the I_STR ioctl  call.
       to  fetch  the entire UDP table. It is a transparent ioctl
       and functions similar to STIOCBTCB, see

       A socket operation may fail  with  one  of  the  following
       errors  returned:  when  an  attempt  is  made to create a
       socket with a port which has already been  allocated  when
       an  attempt  is  made  to  create  a socket with a network

       address for which no network interface exists.  when  try-
       ing  to  establish  a connection on a socket which already
       has one, or when trying to send a datagram with the desti-
       nation  address  specified  and the socket is already con-
       nected when the system runs out of memory for an  internal
       data  structure  when  the system runs out of STREAMS when
       trying to send a datagram, but no destination  address  is
       specified,  and  the socket has not been connected when no
       more UDP devices are available An ioctl operation may fail
       with  the  errno  set  to  one  of  the following: when an
       invalid argument is passed to the driver, or when the com-
       mand  in  the copyresp structure is not valid, or when the
       ioc_count is not TRANSPARENT for a transparent ioctl  when
       the associated file descriptor is no longer open/valid.
