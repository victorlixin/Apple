       Use eels_db_query to query an EELS database for log infor-
       mation. Database queries are in the form of a standard SQL
       query. The output of this command can either  be  in  HTML
       format,  or  in a raw format that is better suited for use
       with scripts.

       When eels_db_query returns data  in  HTML  format,  it  is
       returned  in  a  tabular format that can be displayed by a
       web  browser.  This   is   convenient   when   integrating
       eels_db_query  with  CGI scripts. The table can be printed
       with the field names at the top of the table. In addition,
       the  HTML  table  can be automatically broken into smaller
       tables of a specified size.

       The eels_db_query command can also return data in raw for-
       mat. With this option, each row of output (terminated by a
       newline) corresponds to one  row  in  the  database.  Each
       field of the record is separated by a vertical bar or by a
       user specified field separator on the command  line.  This
       type of output is well suited for integrating this command
       with perl scripts, or other shell script languages.

       The SQL_Query  argument  is  a  string  that  selects  the
       records to be archived.

       The name of the database to connect to.  Specify the char-
       acter that should be used  as  the  field  separator  (Not
       applicable  when  output is in HTML format). Default is |.
       Print output in HTML format.  Print field names  as  first
       line  of  output.  For  HTML  output  the  field names are
       printed at the top of the table as column headings.   List
       all  the fields of the events table, separating each field
       name by a newline.  List all  the  fields  of  the  events
       table, separating each field name by a space.  When output
       is in HTML format, specify the maximum number of lines  in
       a  table  before that table is split into multiple tables.
       The SQL query used to  query  the  database  for  records.
       Print  debugging information. Valid debugging levels are 1
       for minimal logging to 4 for full logging.  When output is
       in  HTML format, wrap data in table fields.  If any of the
       fields that are printed contain data, print them in  human
       readable  format  instead of milliseconds since the EPOCH.
       Do not print HTML page headers when producing HTML output.

       eels_db_query  -d  httpddb  -h  -n  -y  -q  "select * from

       The above example selects  all  records  from  the  events
       table  of  the httpdb database. The output is displayed in
       HTML format, with column headers  and  dates  in  a  human
       readable format.
