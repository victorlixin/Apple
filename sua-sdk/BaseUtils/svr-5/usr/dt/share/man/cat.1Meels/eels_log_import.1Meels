       The eels_log_import command is used by log import  scripts
       to  insert  records  in  the EELS database. Users with the
       appropriate database privileges can  also  import  records
       into the EELS database using this command. eels_log_import
       works in  two  modes,  in  the  first  mode,  records  are
       imported   directly  into  the  database  without  passing
       through the EELS driver, the second mode, the records  are
       passed  through the driver for some basic processing. This
       basic processing includes the assignment of  unique  event
       Ids that are essential for maintaining the integrity of an
       EELS database.  The direct mode of operation is  available
       for  some  of  the standard EELS commands such as For more
       information see the -d option described below.

       The input data stream for eels_log_import must consist  of
       fields and records delimited by field and record delimiter
       characters; these delimiter characters  are  specified  on
       the command line. If either of the delimiters appears in a
       field's text, the log import  script  (that  produces  the
       input  stream) must escape them using the escape character
       \. If the escape character itself appears in  the  field's
       text,  is  must  also be escaped, by using a double escape
       (\\).  The EELSUser configuration block must be defined in
       and  an  RTLSP  process must be running before you can use
       eels_log_import. For  more  information,  see  the  topic.
       This  command  also  provides  the  -l and -L options that
       enable scripts to list the field names within  the  events
       table.

       Specify  the  destination  database  name  where  the data
       stream should be imported. Using this option bypasses  the
       EELS  driver and as such is discouraged. Under normal cir-
       cumstances you should avoid using the -d option, in  which
       case  your  records  are  first  passed through the filter
       attached to the  EELSUser  log  message  source  and  then
       imported  into  the  database  and  table specified by the
       associated data sink. For more information on filters  and
       data  sinks,  see The character the log import script uses
       to delimit fields in the input stream.  The default is the
       pipe symbol |.  List all the field names (one per line) in
       the events table to standard output.  List all  the  field
       names  (separated by a space) in the events table to stan-
       dard output.  A space separated list of field  names  that

       specify  the  order  of the fields within the input stream
       generated by the log import script.  The character the log
       import script uses to delimit records in the input stream.
       The default is the newline character \n.  Specify a desti-
       nation  table  name  to  import  the data stream into. The
       table you specify must have been created previously  using
       The  default table name is events.  Print debugging infor-
       mation. Valid debugging levels are 1 for  minimal  logging
       to 4 for full logging.

       myscript  /var/tmp/mylog | \      eels_log_import -o "Pro-
       cessID, LogSystemSource,  \       TimeOffset,  EventSpeci-
       ficInformation"  This example shows a script myscript that
       reads records from a proprietary log file  /var/tmp/mylog,
       and  prints them to standard out in the order specified by
       the -o option. The fields are  delimited  by  the  default
       character  |  and the records by the default character \n.
       Since no -d or -t options were specified, the records were
       passed  to  the  EELSUser  RTLSP process for filtering and
       logging. For example, if /etc/default/eels  contained  the
       following  configuration blocks: real-time-import EELSUser
       {      EELSUser  default;       filter    EELSUser_filter;
       }   log-destination  default  {       database  defaultdb;
            table          events;  }  filter  EELSUser_filter  {
            include    "EventSpecificInformation    ~   'error'";
            exclude  "EventSpecificInformation  ==  '*'";  }  The
       records  would first be filtered using the EELSUser_filter
       block (only include messages that contain the  word  error
       in  the EventSpecificInformation field).  Any records that
       pass through the filter will be imported into  a  database
       called defaultdb and a table called events.
