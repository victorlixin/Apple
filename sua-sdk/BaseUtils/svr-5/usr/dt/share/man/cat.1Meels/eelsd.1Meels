       The  EELS  daemon performs the following tasks: Starts the
       EELS database.

       starts the database subsystem based on information in  the
       database-info  configuration  block in the eels configura-
       tion file

       If the database process dies, eelsd automatically restarts
       it.  However,  if  eelsd  detects that the process dies as
       soon as it is started, it will not keep trying to restart.
       Spawns RTLSPs.

       spawns  an  RTLSP (Real-Time Logging Source Processor) for
       each real-time-import configuration block that is  in  the
       EELS  configuration file eels_config.  The RTLSP is passed
       the log source, destination, and filter tag that is speci-
       fied  in  the  configuration block.  If one of the RTLSP's
       dies, eelsd restarts it automatically  unless  it  persis-
       tently   dies.   Handles  distributed  logging  connection
       requests.

       remote machines can send their messages to a  central  log
       server  for logging. eelsd listens for connection requests
       from remote RTLSPs.  When  a  TCP  connection  request  is
       detected  from  a remote RTLSP, eelsd spawns a local RTLSP
       to read recv message from the remote RTLSP and log  it  to
       the local database.  Handles script execution.

       eelsd can be configured to execute a script when a partic-
       ular event occurs. Configuration  information  for  script
       execution  is contained in an execute-script configuration
       block in the EELS configuration file eels_config.  Handles
       alarm generation.

       eelsd  can  be configured to generate SNMP traps (that is,
       alarms) when a  particular  event  occurs.   Configuration
       information  for  alarm generation is contained in a send-
       trap configuration block in the  EELS  configuration  file
       eels_config.  Handles dynamic log import.

       automatically  import  log  records  from  proprietary log
       files when the log file grows by a given amount. The char-
       acteristics  of  dynamic  log  import  are  defined in the
       dynamic-import configuration block in the EELS  configura-
       tion  file  eels_config.  For more information on the con-
       figuration blocks that define the behavior of eelsd, see

       Run eelsd in the foreground and print all  debug  informa-
       tion  to  /etc/eels/log/eelsd.log.  Four  debug levels are

                                                                1

       supported; each level is selected by specifying a -d.  For
       example,  to  select  the most verbose level of debugging,
       specify -d -d -d -d.  If eelsd exits  abnormally  for  any
       reason, it will not be able to bind to an internal  domain
       socket the next time it is started.   This  option  forces
       the  binding  to  happen.  Before using this option, first
       make sure that no EELS processes (RTLSPs) are running.  If
       any  of  these  processes  are running you must first kill
       them before restarting eelsd.  This option enables you  to
       set  a  debug  level  for the RTLSP processes that will be
       started by eelsd. All debug flags for RTLSP processes must
       be  enclosed  in  double  quotes. As with eelsd, there are
       four debug levels, each level selected by specifying a -d.
       For  example,  to specify the most verbose level of debug-
       ging for RTLSP processes, specify -o -d -d -d -d.
