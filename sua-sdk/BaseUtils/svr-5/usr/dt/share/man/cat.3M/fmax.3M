       fmax, fmaxf and fmaxl return the larger value of the x and
       y arguments.  NaN arguments are treated as  missing  data,
       if  only  one  of  the  arguments  is NaN and the other is
       numeric, the functions will return the numeric argument as
       the max value.

       fmin,  fminf  and  fminl return the smaller value of the x
       and y arguments.  NaN arguments  are  treated  as  missing
       data, if only one of the arguments is NaN and the other is
       numeric, the functions will return the numeric argument as
       the min value.

       On  systems  that support IEEE NaN, if the argument to any
       of these functions is a quiet NaN, that value is returned.
       If  the  argument  is  a  signaling  NaN,  a  quiet NaN is
       returned and the invalid operation exception is raised. In
       either case, errno is set to EDOM.

       If the program was compiled with the -Xt compilation mode,
       a value that  will  compare  equal  to  HUGE  is  returned
       instead  of HUGE_VAL.  These error handling procedures may
       be changed with the function matherr.
