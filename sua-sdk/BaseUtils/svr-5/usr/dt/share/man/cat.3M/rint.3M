       rint,  rintf and rintl return the nearest integer value to
       its floating point argument x as a double-precision float-
       ing point number.  The returned value is rounded according
       to the currently set machine rounding mode.  If  round-to-
       nearest  (the  default  mode)  is  set  and the difference
       between the function argument and the  rounded  result  is

                                                                1

       exactly  0.5, then the result will be rounded to the near-
       est even integer. If the returned value does not equal the
       value  specified in the argument, the rint functions raise
       the inexact floating-point exception.

       lrint, lrintf, lrintl, llrint, llrintf and  llrintl  round
       their  argument to the nearest integer value, according to
       the current rounding direction. If the  rounded  value  is
       outside  the  range of the return type, the numeric result
       is unspecified. A range error can occur if  the  magnitude
       of x is too large.

       round, roundf and roundl round their argument to the near-
       est  integer  value  in  floating-point  format,  rounding
       halfway  cases  away  from zero, regardless of the current
       rounding direction.

       lround, lroundf, lroundl llround,  llroundf  and  llroundl
       round  their  argument  to  the  nearest  integer value in
       floating-point format, rounding halfway  cases  away  from
       zero, regardless of the current rounding direction. If the
       rounded value is outside the range of the return type, the
       numeric  result is unspecified. A range error can occur if
       the magnitude of x is too large.

       trunc, truncf and truncl return the nearest integer  value
       that is less than or equal to x.

       If  the returned value is calculated as falling outside of
       the range of LONG_MIN to LONG_MAX lrint,  lrintf,  lrintl,
       lround,  lroundf  and  lroundl return LONG_MIN instead and
       set errno to ERANGE.

       If the returned value is calculated as falling outside  of
       the  range  of  LLONG_MIN  to  LLONG_MAX  llrint, llrintf,
       llrintl, llround, llroundf and llroundl  return  LLONG_MIN
       instead and set errno to ERANGE.

       On  systems  that support IEEE NaN, if the argument to any
       of these functions is a quiet NaN, that value is returned.
       If  the  argument  is  a  signaling  NaN,  a  quiet NaN is
       returned and the invalid operation  exception  is  raised.
       In either case, errno is set to EDOM.
