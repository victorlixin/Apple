       j0  and  j1 return Bessel functions of x of the first kind
       of orders 0 and 1, respectively.  jn  returns  the  Bessel
       function of x of the first kind of order n.

       y0  and y1 return Bessel functions of x of the second kind
       of orders 0 and 1, respectively.  yn  returns  the  Bessel
       function of x of the second kind of order n.  The value of
       x must be positive.

       When x is zero, y0, y1, and yn return a  value  that  will
       compare equal to -HUGE_VAL and set errno to EDOM.

       When x is negative, y0, y1, and yn return IEEE NaN on sys-
       tems that support it, otherwise -HUGE_VAL, and  set  errno
       to EDOM.

       Arguments  too large in magnitude cause all of these func-
       tions to return zero and to set errno to ERANGE.

       On systems that support IEEE NaN, if x  is  a  quiet  NaN,
       that  value is returned.  If x is a signaling NaN, a quiet
       NaN is returned and the  invalid  operation  exception  is
       raised.  In either case, errno is set to EDOM.

       If the program was compiled with the -Xt compilation mode,
       non-positive arguments to y0, y1, and yn cause these func-
       tions  to  return a value that will compare equal to -HUGE
       and to set errno to EDOM.  In addition, a message indicat-
       ing  DOMAIN error is printed on the standard error output.
       For arguments too large in magnitude, a message indicating
       TLOSS  error  is  printed on the standard error output, in
       addition to the error  behavior  described  above.   These
       error handling procedures may be changed with the function
       matherr.

                                                                1
