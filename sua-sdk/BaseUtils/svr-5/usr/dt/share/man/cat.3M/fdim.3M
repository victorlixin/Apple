       fdim,  fdimf  and  fdiml  return  the  positive difference
       between the x and y arguments. If x is greater than y then
       the  difference  between the two is returned. If x is less
       than or equal to y then +0 is returned.

       If x is +oo and y is -oo (or vice versa) fdim,  fdimf  and
       fdiml return IEEE NaN on systems that support it and raise
       the invalid operation exception. Otherwise, they return 0.
       errno is set to ERANGE.

       If   x   -  y  overflows  fdim,  fdimf  and  fdiml  return
       +-HUGE_VAL, +-HUGE_VALF or +-HUGE_VALL (respectively)  and
       errno is set to ERANGE.

       On  systems  that support IEEE NaN, if the argument to any
       of these functions is a quiet NaN, that value is returned.
       If  the  argument  is  a  signaling  NaN,  a  quiet NaN is
       returned and the invalid operation  exception  is  raised.
       In either case, errno is set to EDOM.

       If the program was compiled with the -Xt compilation mode,
       a value that  will  compare  equal  to  HUGE  is  returned
       instead  of HUGE_VAL.  These error handling procedures may
       be changed with the function matherr.
