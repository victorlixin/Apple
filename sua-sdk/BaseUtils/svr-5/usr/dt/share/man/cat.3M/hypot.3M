       hypot, hypotf and hypotl return sqrt(x * x + y * y)

       taking precautions against unwarranted overflows.

   EErrrroorrss
       When  the  correct value would overflow, hypot, hypotf and
       hypotl return a value that compares  equal  to  +HUGE_VAL,
       +HUGE_VALF  or +HUGE_VALL (respectively) and sets errno to
       ERANGE.

       On systems that support IEEE NaN, if either argument is  a
       quiet  NaN, that value is returned.  If either argument is
       a signaling NaN, a quiet NaN is returned and  the  invalid
       operation  exception  is raised.  In either case, errno is
       set to EDOM.  The only exception is that if  one  argument
       is  a  NaN  and  the  other argument is +-oo, +HUGE_VAL is
       returned with no error indication.

       If the program was compiled with the -Xt compilation mode,
       a  value  that  will  compare  equal  to  HUGE is returned
       instead of HUGE_VAL.  These error handling procedures  may
       be changed with the function matherr.
