       gamma,  gammaf, gammal, lgamma, lgammaf and lgammal ret_urn
       the natural logarithm of the gamma value of x. Where | (x)
       is defined as:

                       _
       The  sign  of  | (x)  is  returned in the external integer
       signgam. The argument x must be positive and greater  than
       zero. A range error occurs if x is too large.

       tgamma,  tgammaf  and tgammal return the gamma value of x.
       The argument x must be positive and greater than  zero.  A
       range  error  may occur if the magnitude of x is too large
       or too small.

       If x is +-oo, +-0 or a negative  integer,  gamma,  gammaf,
       gammal,  lgamma,  lgammaf  and  lgammal  return +HUGE_VAL,
       +HUGE_VALF or +HUGE_VALL (respectively) and errno  is  set
       to ERANGE.

       If  x  is  -oo, +-0 or a negative integer, tgamma, tgammaf
       and tgammal return IEEE NaN on systems that support it and
       raise  the  invalid  operation  exception. Otherwise, they
       return 0. errno is set to EDOM.

       If x is +oo tgamma, tgammaf and tgammal return  +HUGE_VAL,
       +HUGE_VALF or +HUGE_VALL and errno is set to ERANGE.

                                                                1

gamma(3M)                                               gamma(3M)

       If  the  correct value would overflow, all gamma functions
       return  a  value  that  compares   equal   to   +HUGE_VAL,
       +HUGE_VALF or +HUGE_VALL and set errno to ERANGE.

       On  systems  that  support  IEEE NaN, if x is a quiet NaN,
       that value is returned. If x is a signaling NaN,  a  quiet
       NaN  is  returned  and  the invalid operation exception is
       raised.  In either case, errno is set to EDOM.

       If the program was compiled with the -Xt compilation mode,
       a  value  that  will  compare  equal  to  HUGE is returned
       instead of HUGE_VAL.  In addition, for non-positive  inte-
       ger  arguments, a message indicating SING error is printed
       on the standard error output.  These error handling proce-
       dures may be changed with the function matherr.
