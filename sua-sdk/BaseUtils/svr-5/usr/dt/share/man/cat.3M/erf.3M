       erf, erff and erfl return the error function of x, defined
       as:

       erfc, erfcf and erfcl return 1.0 - erf(x). They  are  pro-
       vided  because  of  the  extreme loss of relative accuracy
       when erf(x) is called for large x and the result  is  sub-
       tracted  from  1.0  (for example, for x = 5, 12 places are
       lost).

   EErrrroorrss
       On systems that support IEEE NaN, if x  is  a  quiet  NaN,
       that  value is returned.  If x is a signaling NaN, a quiet
       NaN is returned and the  invalid  operation  exception  is
       raised.  In either case, errno is set to EDOM.

       In the -Xt compilation mode, the error handling procedures
       may be changed with the function matherr.
