       This section contains manual pages for the routines in the
       libm math library. See for declarations of  functions  and
       constants.  In  addition,  see  for definitions of several
       type-generic macros.

       This library is implemented as a shared  object,  libm.so,
       and an archive, libm.a.  It is not automatically linked by
       the C compilation system.  Specify -lm on the command line
       to  link  with  the  shared object version of the library.
       Specify -dn -lm on the  command  line  to  link  with  the
       archive version of this library and the archive version of
       all other libraries being searched.

       For functions that return a floating-point  value,  if  an
       error occurs, the value of errno will be one of the values
       represented by  the  manifest  constants  EDOM  or  ERANGE
       (defined  in  math.h).   EDOM typically indicates a domain
       error: one of the input values was not in  the  domain  of
       the  function.   ERANGE typically indicates a range error:
       the calculated result was either too big or too  small  to
       be  represented by the data type returned by the function.

       Functions that result in a range  error  typically  return
       zero for underflow or, for overflow, a value that compares
       equal to +-HUGE_VAL, +-HUGE_VALF or +-HUGE_VALL  according
       to  the  function's  precision.   HUGE_VAL,  HUGE_VALF and
       HUGE_VALL are defined in math.h.  On systems that  support
       IEEE infinity, HUGE_VAL is infinity.

       If  the system supports IEEE NaN (not-a-number), functions
       that result in a domain error typically return NaN.   Such
       functions  may  also  raise one of the IEEE floating-point
       exceptions.  On systems that  do  not  support  IEEE  NaN,
       functions  that  result in a domain error typically return
       zero.

       The error behavior for  programs  compiled  with  the  -Xt
       (transitional)  compilation mode is different (see In that
       case, these functions typically  return  zero  instead  of
       IEEE  NaN  for domain errors and a value that will compare
       equal to +-HUGE instead of +-HUGE_VAL for overflows.  HUGE
       is defined in math.h. For more information, see

                                                                1

       A  character (except a multibyte character; see is any bit
       pattern able to fit into a byte on the machine.  The  null
       character is a character with value 0, conventionally rep-
       resented in the C language as \0.  A character array is  a
       sequence of characters.  A null-terminated character array
       (a string) is a sequence of characters, the last of  which
       is  the  null  character.   The null string is a character
       array containing only the terminating null  character.   A
       NULL  pointer  is  the value that is obtained by casting 0
       into a pointer.  C guarantees that  this  value  will  not
       match  that  of  any legitimate pointer, so many functions
       that return pointers return NULL  to  indicate  an  error.
       The  macro  NULL is defined in stdio.h.  Types of the form
       size_t are defined in the appropriate header files.
