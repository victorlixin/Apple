       thr_setprio  sets  tid's  scheduling  priority to be prio.
       thr_setscheduler can also be used to set the priority of a
       thread,  but  thr_setprio is a shorthand for use when only
       the priority,  not  the  scheduling  class,  needs  to  be
       changed.

       For  bound  threads,  the priority set with thr_setprio is
       passed to the system scheduler; it is  not  maintained  by
       the  Threads Library.  For multiplexed threads, the prior-
       ity set with thr_setprio is used by the Threads Library in
       scheduling multiplexed threads to run on LWPs.  The prior-
       ities for multiplexed threads remain fixed (unless explic-
       itly  changed  with  thr_setscheduler or thr_setprio), and
       the Threads Library assigns  higher  priority  threads  to
       LWPs before lower priority threads.

       In   this  implementation,  the  priority  range  for  the
       SCHED_TS policy for multiplexed threads is  from  zero  to
       MAXINT-1.   However,  for better performance, we recommend
       using a maximum priority of 126  or  lower.   The  default
       priority for multiplexed threads is 63.

       In  all  scheduling policies supported by this implementa-
       tion, numerically higher values represent  higher  priori-
       ties.

       Bound threads running under any scheduling policy are sub-
       ject to the priority ranges set by the system.  Use or  to
       find what scheduling priorities are available on your sys-
       tem.

       No privileges or special permissions are required  to  use
       thr_setprio  to  set the priority of a multiplexed thread.
       The following rules apply  to  changing  the  priority  of
       bound  threads:  You  can always lower the priority of any
       bound thread.  You can always raise the priority of  bound
       threads  in the SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR classes.  You must
       have privilege to raise the priority of a bound thread  in
       the  SCHED_TS  class.   The required privileges might vary
       across installations.

       thr_setprio returns zero for success and an  error  number
       for failure.

   EErrrroorrss
       If  any  of  the  following  error conditions is detected,
       thr_setprio fails and returns the corresponding value: The
       value of prio is invalid for tid's current scheduling pol-
       icy.  The caller does not have  appropriate  privilege  to
       set  the  priority  of tid.  No thread with identifier tid
       can be found in the process.
