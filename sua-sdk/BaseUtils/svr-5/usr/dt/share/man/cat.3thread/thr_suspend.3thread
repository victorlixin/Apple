DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       thr_suspend suspends execution of target_thread.  thr_sus-
       pend returns when target_thread is suspended.   A  concur-
       rent  thr_continue  of  the  same  thread might be lost or
       might take effect depending on the timing.

       If target_thread is already suspended, thr_suspend has  no
       effect.

       A thread might suspend itself.

       thr_continue will resume the execution of target_thread.

       thr_suspend  returns  zero for success and an error number
       for failure.

   EErrrroorrss
       If any of the  following  conditions  occurs,  thr_suspend
       returns  the  corresponding value: target_thread cannot be
       found in the current process

UUssaaggee
       We do not recommend using thr_suspend and thr_continue  to
       synchronize   threads.    Use   synchronization   routines
       instead.
