       thr_kill sends the signal sig to the sibling thread tid.

       If  tid  is  blocking  signal  sig, the signal will become
       pending for tid.

       thr_kill is the thread analog of

       thread ID of the thread to receive the signal signal  num-
       ber of the signal to be sent

       tid  is  the  thread  ID of the sibling thread which is to
       receive the signal.  A thread cannot send a  signal  to  a
       thread in another process (a non-sibling thread).

       sig  is  the signal number of the signal to be sent and is
       either 0 or a value from the list given in

       If sig is 0 (the null signal), error checking is performed
       but  no signal is actually sent; this can be used to check
       the validity of tid.

       To maintain integrity of the Threads  Library  implementa-
       tion, threads cannot send SIGLWP or SIGWAITING.

       thr_kill  returns zero for success and an error number for
       failure.

   EErrrroorrss
       If  any  of  the  following  conditions  occurs,  thr_kill
       returns the corresponding value: sig is not a valid signal
       number or is either SIGLWP or SIGWAITING.  tid  cannot  be
       found in the current process.
