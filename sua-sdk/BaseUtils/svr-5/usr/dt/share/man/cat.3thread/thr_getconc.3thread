DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       thr_getconcurrency  returns  the level, or degree, of con-
       currency, which is the  number  of  lightweight  processes
       (LWPs)  the user has requested to be available for running
       multiplexed threads.  This is the  number  from  the  most
       recent  thr_setconcurrency call (or zero if there has been
       no call) plus the  number  of  threads  created  with  the
       THR_INCR_CONC  flag set since the last call to thr_setcon-
       currency.  The return value does not reflect the number of
       LWPs actually available.

RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       thr_getconcurrency  returns  the  degree of concurrency as
       described.

       thr_getconcurrency cannot fail.
