       int setregid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid);

       setregid  is  used to set the real and effective group IDs
       of the calling process.  If rgid is -1, the  real  GID  is
       not  changed;  if  egid  is  -1,  the effective GID is not
       changed.  The real and effective GIDs may be set  to  dif-
       ferent values in the same call.

       If  the  calling  process  has the P_SETUID privilege, the
       real GID and the effective GID can be  set  to  any  valid
       value.

       If  the  calling process does not have the P_SETUID privi-
       lege, either the real GID can be set to the  saved  setGID
       from  execv, or the effective GID can either be set to the
       saved setGID or the real GID.  Note: if a  setGID  process
       sets  its  effective GID to its real GID, it can still set
       its effective GID back to the saved setGID.

       Upon successful completion, a  value  of  0  is  returned.
       Otherwise,  a  value of -1 is returned and errno is set to
       indicate the error.

EErrrroorrss
       setregid will fail and neither of the group  IDs  will  be
       changed if: The value of rgid or egid is invalid or out of
       range.  The calling process does  not  have  the  P_SETUID
       privilege,  and  a change other than changing the real GID
       to the saved setGID, or changing the effective GID to  the
       real GID or the saved GID, was specified.

       If a user application calling this routine was compiled on
       &everest;, then the P_SETUID privilege is not required.
