       cc [flag . . . ] flag . . .  long nap(long period);

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The  current  process  is  suspended from execution for at
       least the number of milliseconds specified by  period,  or
       until a signal is received.

   RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       On  successful  completion,  a long integer indicating the
       number of milliseconds actually  slept  is  returned.   On
       failure,  nap  returns  -1  and sets errno to identify the
       error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the following conditions, nap fails and sets errno  to:
       The system lacked resources necessary to perform the oper-
       ation.  Subsequent  attempts  may  succeed.   The  process
       received  a  signal while napping.  The period argument is
       negative or greater than  the  maximum  permissible  value
       (which  is system dependent, but represents an interval of
       several hours).

       This function is driven by the system clock, which in most
       cases has a granularity of tens of milliseconds.
