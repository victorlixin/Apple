       The  makedev  routine returns a formatted device number on
       success and NODEV on failure.  maj is  the  major  number.
       min  is the minor number.  makedev can be used to create a
       device number for input to

       The major routine returns the major number component  from
       device.

       The minor routine returns the minor number component  from
       device.

       On failure, NODEV is returned and errno is set to indicate
       the error.

       makedev  will  fail  if  one  or more of the following are
       true:

       One or both of the arguments maj and  min  is  too  large.
       The device number created from maj and min is NODEV.

       major  will fail if one or more of the following are true:
       The device argument is NODEV.  The major number  component
       of device is too large.

       minor will fail if the following is true: The device argu-
       ment is NODEV.
