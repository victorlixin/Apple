       The fdetach routine detaches a STREAMS-based file descrip-
       tor from a name in the file system.  path is the path name
       of  the  object  in  the file system name space, which was
       previously attached (see The user must be the owner of the
       file  or a user with the appropriate privileges.  All sub-
       sequent operations on path will operate on the file system
       node  and  not  on  the STREAMS file.  The permissions and
       status of the node are restored to the state the node  was
       in before the STREAMS file was attached to it.

       If  successful, fdetach returns 0; otherwise it returns -1
       and sets errno to indicate an error.

   EErrrroorrss
       Under the following conditions, the function fdetach fails
       and sets errno to:

       The effective user ID is not the owner of path or is not a
       user with appropriate permissions.   A  component  of  the
       path  prefix  is  not  a  directory.  path does not exist.
       path is not attached to a STREAMS file.  The size of  path
       exceeds  {PATH_MAX},  or  a  path name component is longer
       than {NAME_MAX} while {_POSIX_NO_TRUNC} is in effect.  Too
       many  symbolic links were encountered in translating path.
