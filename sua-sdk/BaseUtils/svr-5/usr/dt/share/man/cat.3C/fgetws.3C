       The fgetws function reads characters from the stream, con-
       verts these to  the  corresponding  wide-character  codes,
       places  them  in the wchar_t array pointed to by ws, until
       n-1 characters are read, or a newline character  is  read,
       converted  and transferred to ws, or an end-of-file condi-
       tion is encountered.  The wide character  string,  ws,  is
       then terminated with a NULL wide-character code.

       If  an error occurs, the resulting value of the file posi-
       tion indicator for the stream is indeterminate.

       The fgetws function may mark the  st_atime  field  of  the
       file  associated  with  stream  for  update.  The st_atime
       field will be marked for update by  the  first  successful
       execution  of fgetc, fgets, fgetwc, fgetws, fread, fscanf,
       getc, getchar, gets, or scanf using  stream  that  returns
       data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc or ungetwc.

       Upon  successful completion, fgetws returns ws.  If stream
       is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for stream is
       set  and  fgetws  returns a NULL pointer.  If a read error
       occurs, the error indicator  for  stream  is  set,  fgetws
       returns  a  NULL pointer, and errno is set to indicate the
       error.
