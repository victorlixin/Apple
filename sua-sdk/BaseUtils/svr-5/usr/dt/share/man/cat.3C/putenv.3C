       string  points  to  a  string  of the form ``name=value.''
       putenv makes the value of the  environment  variable  name
       equal  to value by altering an existing variable or creat-
       ing a new one.  In either case, the string pointed  to  by
       string  becomes  part  of the environment, so altering the
       string will change the environment.  string should not  be
       a  local  (stack allocated) variable, since returning from
       the current function and calling a new one will change the
       environment.   If  name  is  later  redefined  by  another
       putenv, string is no longer used.  It may  be  altered  or
       reused without affecting the environment.

       putenv  returns non-zero if it was unable to obtain enough
       space via malloc for an  expanded  environment,  otherwise
       zero.

       putenv  manipulates the environment pointed to by environ,
       and can be used in conjunction with getenv.  However, envp
       (the third argument to main) is not changed.
       This routine uses to enlarge the environment.
       After  putenv  is called, environment variables are not in
       alphabetical order.

       A potential error is to call the function  putenv  with  a
       pointer  to  an  automatic variable as the argument and to
       then exit the calling function while string is still  part
       of the environment.
