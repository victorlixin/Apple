       If  the  argument  to towupper is a wide character that is
       also a lowercase letter, the result is  the  corresponding
       uppercase  letter.   If the argument to towlower is a wide
       character that is also an uppercase letter, the result  is
       the corresponding lowercase letter.

       In  the  case  of all other arguments, the return value is
       unchanged.
