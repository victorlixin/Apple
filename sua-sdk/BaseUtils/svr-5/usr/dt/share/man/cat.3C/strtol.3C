       strtol returns as a long integer the value represented  by
       the  character  string  pointed  to by str.  The string is
       scanned up to the first character  inconsistent  with  the
       base.   Leading  ``white-space'' characters [as defined by
       isspace in are ignored.

       If the value of ptr is not (char **)NULL, a pointer to the
       character terminating the scan is returned in the location
       pointed to by ptr.  If no  integer  can  be  formed,  that
       location is set to str, and zero is returned.

       If  base is between 2 and 36, inclusive, it is used as the
       base for conversion.   After  an  optional  leading  sign,
       leading zeros are ignored, and ``0x'' or ``0X'' is ignored
       if base is 16.  A leading 0b or 0B is ignored if  base  is
       2.

       If  base is zero, the string itself determines the base as
       follows: After an optional leading  sign  a  leading  zero
       indicates octal conversion, and a leading ``0x'' or ``0X''
       hexadecimal conversion.  Otherwise, decimal conversion  is
       used.

       Truncation  from  long  to  int can, of course, take place
       upon assignment or by an explicit cast.

       If the value represented  by  str  would  cause  overflow,
       LONG_MAX or LONG_MIN is returned (according to the sign of
       the value), and errno is set to the value, ERANGE.

       strtoul is similar to strtol except that  strtoul  returns
       as  an unsigned long integer the value represented by str.
       If the value represented  by  str  would  cause  overflow,
       ULONG_MAX  is  returned,  and  errno  is set to the value,

                                                                1

       ERANGE.

       The strtoll and strtoull routines are similar, except that
       the  return  value  is  long  long  or unsigned long long,
       respectively.

       Except for behavior on error, atol(str) is equivalent  to:
       strtol(str, (char **)NULL, 10)

       Except for behavior on error, atoll(str) is equivalent to:
       strtoll(str, (char **)NULL, 10)

       Except for behavior on error, atoi(str) is equivalent  to:
       (int) strtol(str, (char **)NULL, 10)

       If  strtol is given a base greater than 36 or less than 2,
       it returns 0 and sets errno to EINVAL.

       strtol no longer accepts values greater than  LONG_MAX  as
       valid input.  Use strtoul instead.
