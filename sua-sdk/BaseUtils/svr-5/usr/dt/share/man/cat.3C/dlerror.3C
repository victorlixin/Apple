       dlerror  returns  a null-terminated character string (with
       no trailing newline) that describes the  last  error  that
       occurred during dynamic linking processing.  If no dynamic
       linking errors have occurred since the last invocation  of
       dlerror,  dlerror  returns NULL.  Thus, invoking dlerror a
       second time, immediately  following  a  prior  invocation,
       results in NULL being returned.

       The  messages  returned  by dlerror may reside in a static
       buffer that  is  overwritten  on  each  call  to  dlerror.
       Application  code  should  not write to this buffer.  Pro-
       grams wishing to preserve an  error  message  should  make
       their own copies of that message.
