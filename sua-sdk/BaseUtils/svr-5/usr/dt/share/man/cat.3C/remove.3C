       int remove(const char *path);

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       remove  causes  the  file or empty directory whose name is
       the string pointed to by path to be no  longer  accessible
       by  that  name.   A  subsequent  attempt to open that file
       using that name will fail,  unless  the  file  is  created
       anew.

       For files, remove is identical to unlink. For directories,
       remove is identical to rmdir.

       See and for a detailed list of failure conditions.

       Upon successful completion, remove returns a value  of  0;
       otherwise,  it  returns  a  value  of -1 and sets errno to
       indicate an error.
