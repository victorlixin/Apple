       The  getwd function determines an absolute pathname of the
       current working directory  of  the  calling  process,  and
       copies  that  pathname  into  the  array pointed to by the
       path_name argument.

       If the length of  the  pathname  of  the  current  working
       directory  is  greater  than (PATH_MAX + 1), including the
       null byte, then getwd fails and returns  a  NULL  pointer.
       (See for a description of PATH_MAX.)

       Upon  successful  completion, a pointer to the string con-
       taining the  absolute  pathname  of  the  current  working
       directory  is  returned.   Otherwise, getwd returns a NULL
       pointer and the  contents  of  the  array  pointed  to  by
       path_name are undefined.

       For  portability to earlier implementations of the UNIX(R)
       system, is preferred over this function.
