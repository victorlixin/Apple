       The  wait3  function  allows the calling process to obtain
       status information for specified child processes.  See for
       a description of the arguments to wait3.

       Note  that  the  following  call: wait3(stat_loc, options,
       r_usage);

       is equivalent to the  call:  waitpid((pid_t)-1,  stat_loc,
       options);

       except that on successful completion, if the r_usage argu-
       ment to wait3 is not a NULL pointer, the rusage  structure
       to  which  the  third argument points is filled in for the
       child process identified by the return value.

       If wait3 returns because the status of a child process  is
       available,  it  returns a value equal to the process ID of
       the child process for which status  is  reported.   If  it
       returns  due  to  the  delivery of a signal to the calling
       process, -1 is returned and errno is  set  to  EINTR.   If
       waitpid was invoked with WNOHANG set in options, it has at
       least one child process specified by pid for which  status
       is not available, and status is not available for any pro-
       cess specified by pid, 0  will  be  returned.   Otherwise,
       (pid_t)-1  is  returned,  and errno is set to indicate the
       error.

EErrrroorrss
       The wait3 function will fail if: The calling  process  has
       no  existing unwaited-for child processes; or, the process
       or process group specified by pid does not exist or is not
       a  child  of the calling process.  The function was inter-
       rupted by a signal.  The value of the location pointed  to
       by  stat_loc  is  undefined.   The options argument is not
       valid.
