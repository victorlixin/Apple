       wcscat  appends  a  copy of the wide character string ws2,
       including the NULL wide character, to the end of the  wide
       character string ws1.  The terminating null wide character
       at the end of ws1 is overwritten by the initial wide char-
       acter  of ws2.  The behavior is undefined if copying takes
       place between overlapping objects.

       These functions do not check for an overflow condition  of
       the array pointed to by ws1.

   RReettuurrnn vvaalluuee
       wcscat returns ws1.
