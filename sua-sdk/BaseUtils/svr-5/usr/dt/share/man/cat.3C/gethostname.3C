       The  gethostname  function  returns the standard host name
       for the current machine.  The namelen  argument  specifies
       the  size  of  the  array pointed to by the name argument.
       The returned name is null-terminated.  If  namelen  is  an
       insufficient  length  to  hold  the  host  name,  then the
       returned name is truncated to (namelen - 1) characters and
       null-terminated.  Host names are limited to 255 bytes.

       sethostname  sets the name of the host machine to be name,
       which has length namelen.  This call is  restricted  to  a
       privileged  user and is normally used only when the system
       is bootstrapped.

       The  following  errors may be returned by these calls: The
       name or namelen parameter gave an  invalid  address.   The
       caller does not have appropriate privilege to use sethost-
       name.

       The gethostname routine conforms to X/Open  System  Inter-
       faces and Headers, Issue 4, Version 2.

       The  sethostname  routine  does not conform to any current
       industry standard.
