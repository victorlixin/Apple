       nl_langinfo  returns a pointer to a null-terminated string
       containing information relevant to a  particular  language
       or  cultural  area  defined  in the program's locale.  The
       manifest constant names and values of item are defined  by
       langinfo.h.

       For example: nl_langinfo(ABDAY_1);

       would  return a pointer to the string "Dim" if the identi-
       fied language was French and a French locale was correctly
       installed;   or  "Sun"  if  the  identified  language  was
       English.

       If setlocale has not been called successfully, or if lang-
       info data for a supported language is either not available
       or item is not defined therein, then nl_langinfo returns a
       pointer  to  the corresponding string in the C locale.  In
       all locales, nl_langinfo returns a  pointer  to  an  empty
       string if item contains an invalid setting.

       The  array  pointed  to  by the return value should not be
       modified by the program.  Subsequent calls to  nl_langinfo
       may overwrite the array.

       The nl_langinfo function is built on the functions locale-
       conv, strftime, and gettxt [see Where possible  users  are
       advised  to  use  these  interfaces  to  the required data
       instead of using calls to nl_langinfo.
