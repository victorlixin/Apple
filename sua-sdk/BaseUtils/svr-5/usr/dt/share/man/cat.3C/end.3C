       These  names  refer  neither  to routines nor to locations
       with interesting contents; only their addresses are  mean-
       ingful.

       The  address  of etext is the first address above the pro-
       gram text.  The address of  edata  is  the  first  address
       above  the initialized data region.  The address of end is
       the first address above the uninitialized data region.

       When execution begins, the program break (the first  loca-
       tion  beyond the data) coincides with end, but the program
       break may be reset by the routines brk, malloc, the  stan-
       dard  input/output library [see by the profile (-p) option
       of cc, and so on.  Thus, the current value of the  program
       break should be determined by sbrk (0) [see
