       wcsncmp compares not more than n wide characters from  the
       array  pointed  to  by ws1 to the array pointed to by ws2.
       The function does not compare wide characters that  follow
       a null wide character.

       wcsncmp compares its arguments and returns an integer less
       than, equal to, or greater than zero, depending on whether
       the  wide  string  ws1  is less than, equal to, or greater
       than the wide string ws2.  The null  wide  character  com-
       pares less than any other wide character.
