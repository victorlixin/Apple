       realpath resolves all links, symbolic  links,  and  refer-
       ences  to  ``.''  and ``..'' in file_name and stores it in
       resolved_name.

       realpath takes as input both relative  and  absolute  path
       names.  It returns the ``resolved absolute'' name.

       resolved_name  must  be big enough (MAXPATHLEN) to contain
       the fully resolved path name.

       If there is no error, realpath returns a  pointer  to  the
       resolved_name.   Otherwise  it  returns a null pointer and
       places the name of the offending  file  in  resolved_name.
       The global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

       realpath operates on null-terminated strings.

       One  should have execute permission on all the directories
       in the given and the resolved path.
