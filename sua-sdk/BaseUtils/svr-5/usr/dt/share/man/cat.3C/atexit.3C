       int atexit(void (*func)(void));

       atexit adds the function func to a list of functions to be
       called without arguments on normal termination of the pro-
       gram.   Normal  termination occurs by either a call to the
       exit system call or a return from main.  At least 32 func-
       tions  may  be registered by atexit; the functions will be
       called in the reverse order of their registration.

   RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       atexit returns 0 if the registration succeeds, nonzero  if
       it fails.

   NNoottiicceess
       If  a  signal is sent to a process that would have Exit or
       Core actions, the functions registered with atexit are not
       called.  See
