       killpg  sends  the  signal  sig to the process group pgrp.
       See for a list of signals.

       The real or effective user ID of the sending process  must
       match  the real or saved set-user ID of the receiving pro-
       cess, unless the calling process  has  appropriate  privi-
       lege.

       A single exception is the signal SIGCONT, which may always
       be sent to any descendant of the current process.

       Upon successful completion, a  value  of  0  is  returned.
       Otherwise,  a value of -1 is returned and the global vari-
       able errno is set to indicate the error.

       killpg will fail and no signal will be sent if any of  the
       following  occur:  The  value  of  the  sig argument is an
       invalid or unsupported signal number.   The  process  does
       not  have  permission  to send the signal to any receiving
       process.  That is,  the  sending  process  does  not  have
       appropriate  privilege, and neither its real nor effective
       user ID matches the real or saved set-user ID  of  one  or
       more of the target processes.  No process or process group
       can be found corresponding to that specified by pid.
