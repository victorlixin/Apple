       wcsftime puts wide character codes into the array  pointed
       to  by  wcs as controlled by the string pointed to by for-
       mat.  It behavior is similar to strftime, except that  the
       format  and  the  result  are wide character strings.  Not
       more than size wide characters are placed into  the  array
       pointed  to by wcs.  See for a complete description of the
       conversion specifications.

       The behavior is undefined if copying takes  place  between
       objects that overlap.

       If  the  size of the resultant wide character codes inclu-
       sive of the terminating null wide character code is within
       the  size limit, wcsftime returns the number of wide char-
       acter codes in the array pointed to by wcs,  exclusive  of
       the  terminating  null wide character code.  Otherwise, it
       returns zero and the contents of the array are  indetermi-
       nate.

       If  the  feature test macro _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined, then
       the following synopsis may be defined:

       int wcsftime(wchar_t *wcs, size_t size, const  char  *for-
       mat, const struct tm *timeptr);
