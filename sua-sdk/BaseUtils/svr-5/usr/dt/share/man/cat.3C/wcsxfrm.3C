       wcsxfrm is part of the X/Open Portability  Guide  Issue  4
       optional Enhanced Internationalization feature group.

       wcsxfrm transforms the wide character string pointed to by
       ws2 and places the resulting wide  character  string  into
       the  array pointed to by ws1.  The transformation does the
       following:

       If wcscmp is applied to two transformed wide  strings,  it
       returns  a  value  greater than, or equal to, zero, corre-
       sponding to the result of wcscoll applied to the same  two
       original wide character strings.

       No  more  than  n wide-character codes are placed into the
       resulting array pointed to by wcs1, including  the  termi-
       nating  null  wide-character code.  If n is zero, wcs1 can
       be a null pointer.  If copying takes place between objects
       that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

       wcsxfrm  returns  the  length necessary to hold the entire
       transformed wide character string, not including the  ter-
       minating  null wide-character code.  If the value returned
       is n or more, the contents of the array pointed to by  ws1
       are  indeterminate.   wcsxfrm returns -1 and sets errno to
       ENOSYS.

   EErrrroorrss
       wcsxfrm may fail if The ws1 or ws2 arguments contain  wide
       character  codes  outside  the  domain  of  the  collating
       sequence.  The function is not supported

UUssaaggee
       Since no return value is reserved to show an error, if you
       want  to check for errors, you should set errno to 0, call
       wcscoll, and then check errno.  If it is non-zero, you can
       assume that an error has occurred.
