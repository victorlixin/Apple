       strcoll returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less
       than zero in direct correlation to whether  string  s1  is
       greater  than,  equal to, or less than the string s2.  The
       comparison is based on strings interpreted as  appropriate
       to the program's locale for category LC_COLLATE [see

       Both  strcoll  and  strxfrm  provide  for  locale-specific
       string sorting.  strcoll is intended for  applications  in
       which the number of comparisons per string is small.  When
       strings are to be compared a number of times, strxfrm is a
       more  appropriate  utility because the transformation pro-
       cess occurs only once.
