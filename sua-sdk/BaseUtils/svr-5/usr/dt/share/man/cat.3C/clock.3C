       clock  returns  the  amount  of CPU time (in microseconds)
       used since the first call to clock in the calling process.
       The  time reported is the sum of the user and system times
       of the calling process and its terminated child  processes
       for which it has executed the wait system call, the pclose
       function, or the system function.

       Dividing the value  returned  by  clock  by  the  constant
       CLOCKS_PER_SEC  (or  a  million),  defined  in  the time.h
       header file, will give the time in seconds.

       The resolution of the clock is defined by CLK_TCK in  lim-
       its.h, and is typically 1/100 or 1/60 of a second.

       The value returned by clock is defined in microseconds for
       compatibility with systems that have CPU clocks with  much
       higher  resolution.   Because  of this, the value returned
       will wrap around after accumulating only 2147  seconds  of
       CPU  time (about 36 minutes).  If the process time used is
       not available or cannot be represented, clock returns  the
       value (clock_t)-1.
