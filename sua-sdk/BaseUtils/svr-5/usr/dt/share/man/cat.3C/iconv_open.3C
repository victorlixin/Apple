       iconv_open returns a conversion descriptor for the codeset
       conversion  from  codeset fromcode to codeset tocode. This
       descriptor is used on subsequent calls to iconv.

       The allowable values for fromcode and tocode are dependent
       on the implementation. This is also true for the different
       combinations allowed.

       A conversion descriptor is valid until the  creating  pro-
       cess terminates, or until it is passed to iconv_close.

       If   iconv_open   completes   successfully,  a  conversion
       descriptor   is    returned.     Should    the    function
       fail,iconv_open  returns  (iconv_t)-1  and errno is set to
       indicate an error.

       There may be no more file descriptors free  for  the  pro-
       cess.   There  may  be  too many open files on the system.
       Not enough memory.  The implementation  does  not  support
       the specified conversion.

       In some implementations, this function uses dynamic memory
       allocation (malloc) to provide space for  internal  buffer
       areas.   If  there  is not enough space to cater for these
       buffers, it is likely that the  iconv_open  function  will
       fail.

       Applications that are portable must assume that conversion
       descriptors are invalidated after one of  the  exec  func-
       tions is called.
