       dlclose disassociates a shared object previously opened by
       dlopen from the current process.  Once an object has  been
       closed  using dlclose, its symbols are no longer available
       to dlsym.  All objects loaded automatically as a result of
       invoking  dlopen  on  the  referenced object [see are also
       closed.  handle is the value returned by a previous  invo-
       cation of dlopen.

       If  the referenced object was successfully closed, dlclose
       returns 0.  If the object could not be closed, or if  han-
       dle  does  not  refer to an open object, dlclose returns a
       non-0 value.   More  detailed  diagnostic  information  is
       available through dlerror.

       A successful invocation of dlclose does not guarantee that
       the objects associated  with  handle  have  actually  been
       removed  from  the  address space of the process.  Objects
       loaded by one invocation of dlopen may also be  loaded  by
       another invocation of dlopen.  The same object may also be
       opened multiple times.  An object is not removed from  the
       address  space until all references to that object through
       an explicit dlopen invocation have  been  closed  and  all
       other objects implicitly referencing that object have also
       been closed.

       Once an object has been  closed  by  dlclose,  referencing
       symbols  contained  in  that  object  can  cause undefined
       behavior.
