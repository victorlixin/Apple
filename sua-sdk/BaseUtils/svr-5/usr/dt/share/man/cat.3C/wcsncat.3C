       wcsncat appends at most n wide characters  from  the  wide
       string  ws2 to the end of the wide string ws1.  Wide char-
       acters that follow a null wide character are  not  copied.
       The  null  wide character at the end of ws1 is overwritten
       by the initial wide character of ws2.  A terminating  null
       wide  character  is  always  appended  to the result.  The
       behavior is undefined if copying occurs  between  overlap-
       ping  objects.   This function does not check for an over-
       flow condition of the array pointed to by ws1.
