       These functions manipulate sigset_t data types, represent-
       ing the set of signals supported by the implementation.

       sigemptyset initializes the  set  pointed  to  by  set  to
       exclude all signals defined by the system.

       sigfillset  initializes  the  set  pointed  to  by  set to
       include all signals defined by the system.

       sigaddset adds the  individual  signal  specified  by  the
       value of signo to the set pointed to by set.

       sigdelset  deletes  the individual signal specified by the
       value of signo from the set pointed to by set.

       sigismember checks whether the  signal  specified  by  the
       value of signo is a member of the set pointed to by set.

       Any  object of type sigset_t must be initialized by apply-
       ing either sigemptyset or sigfillset before  applying  any
       other operation.

       Upon   successful  completion,  the  sigismember  function
       returns a value of one if the specified signal is a member
       of  the  specified  set,  or a value of zero if it is not.
       Upon successful completion, the other functions  return  a
       value  of  zero.   Otherwise a value of -1 is returned and
       errno is set to indicate the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the  following  conditions,  sigaddset,  sigdelset  and
       sigismember will fail and set errno to:

       The value of the signo argument is not a valid signal num-
       ber.
