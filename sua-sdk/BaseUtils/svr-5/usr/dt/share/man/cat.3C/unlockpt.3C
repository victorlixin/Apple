       The  function  unlockpt clears a lock flag associated with
       the slave pseudo-terminal device associated with its  mas-
       ter  pseudo-terminal counterpart so that the slave pseudo-
       terminal device can be opened.  fildes is a file  descrip-
       tor  returned  from  a successful open of a master pseudo-
       terminal device.

   RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       Upon successful completion, the function unlockpt  returns
       0; otherwise it returns -1.

   EErrrroorrss
       A failure may occur if fildes is not an open file descrip-
       tor or is not associated  with  a  master  pseudo-terminal
       device.
