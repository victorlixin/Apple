       fsetpos  sets  the  position  of  the next input or output
       operation on the stream according  to  the  value  of  the
       object  pointed  to  by pos.  The object pointed to by pos
       must be a value returned by an earlier call to fgetpos  on
       the same stream.

       fsetpos  clears  the  end-of-file indicator for the stream
       and undoes any effects of the ungetc function on the  same
       stream.   After  fsetpos,  the  next  operation  on a file
       opened for update may be either input or output.

       fgetpos stores the current  value  of  the  file  position
       indicator for stream in the object pointed to by pos.  The
       value stored contains information usable  by  fsetpos  for
       repositioning  the  stream  to its position at the time of
       the call to fgetpos.

       If successful, fsetpos, fsetpos64, fgetpos, and  fgetpos64
       return  zero.   Otherwise, they all return nonzero and set
       errno to indicate the error.  For example, errno is set by
       fgetpos when the current value of the file position cannot
       be represented correctly in an object of type fpos_t.

       fsetpos64 and fgetpos64 support large files, but are  oth-
       erwise  identical  to  their counterparts.  For details on
       programming for large file capable  applications,  see  on
       intro(2).
