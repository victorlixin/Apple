       wcscmp  compares its arguments and returns an integer less
       than, equal to, or greater than zero, depending on whether
       wide  character  string  ws1  is  less  than, equal to, or
       greater than wide character string  ws2.   The  null  wide
       character compares less than any other wide character.
