       The  routine  setlabel defines the label for messages pro-
       duced in standard format by subsequent calls to  pfmt  and
       vpfmt.

       label  is a character string no more than 25 characters in
       length.

       No label is defined before setlabel  is  called.   A  null
       pointer  or  an empty string passed as argument will reset
       the definition of the label.

       setlabel returns 0 in case of success, non-zero otherwise.

       The  following  code  (without previous call to setlabel):
       pfmt(stderr, MM_ERROR, "test:2:Cannot open file\n");  set-
       label("UX:test");  pfmt(stderr,  MM_ERROR,  "test:2:Cannot
       open file\n");

       will produce the following output: ERROR: Cannot open file
       UX:test: ERROR: Cannot open file

       The label should be set once at the beginning of a utility
       and remain constant.

       has been modified to report errors using the standard mes-
       sage  format.  If setlabel is called before getopt, getopt
       will use that label.  Otherwise, getopt will use the  name
       of the utility.
