       The  putspent routine is the inverse of getspent.  Given a
       pointer to a spwd structure created by the  getspent  rou-
       tine  (or  the  getspnam  routine),  the  putspent routine
       writes a line on the stream fp, which matches  the  format
       of /etc/shadow.

       If  the  sp_min,  sp_max, sp_lstchg, sp_warn, sp_inact, or
       sp_expire field of the spwd structure is -1, or if sp_flag
       is 0, the corresponding /etc/shadow field is cleared.

       The  putspent  routine  returns  non-zero  if an error was
       detected during its operation; otherwise it returns  zero.
