       wcscoll  is  part  of the X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4
       optional Enhanced Internationalization feature group.   It
       compares  the  wide  character string pointed to by ws1 to
       the wide character string pointed to  by  ws2,  which  are
       both interpreted as appropriate to the LC_COLLATE category
       of the current locale.

       wcscoll returns 0 and sets errno to ENOSYS.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the following conditions, wcscoll fails and sets  errno
       to:  The ws1 or ws2 arguments contain wide character codes
       outside the domain of the collating sequence.   The  func-
       tion is not supported

UUssaaggee
       Since no return value is reserved to show an error, if you
       want to check for errors, you should set errno to 0,  call
       wcscoll, and then check errno.  If it is non-zero, you can
       assume that an error has occurred.

       Use wcsxfrm and wcscmp for sorting  large  lists  of  wide
       character strings.
