       The  ftime  function  sets the time and millitm members of
       the timeb structure pointed to by tp to contain  the  sec-
       onds  and milliseconds portions, respectively, of the cur-
       rent time in seconds since 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated  Uni-
       versal Time), January 1, 1970.

       The  contents  of  the  timezone and dstflag members of tp
       after a call to ftime are unspecified.

RReettuurrnn vvaalluuee
       Upon successful completion, the ftime function returns  0.
       Otherwise -1 is returned.

UUssaaggee
       For  portability  to implementations conforming to earlier
       standards, is preferred over this function.

       The millisecond value usually has  a  granularity  greater
       than  one  due  to  the  resolution  of  the system clock.
       Depending on any granularity (particularly  a  granularity
       of one) renders code non-portable.
