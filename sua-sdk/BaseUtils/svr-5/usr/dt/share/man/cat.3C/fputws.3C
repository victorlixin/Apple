       int fputws(const wchar_t *ws, FILE *stream);

       The  fputws function writes a character string correspond-
       ing to the (NULL-terminated) wide character string pointed
       to by ws to the stream pointed to by stream.  No character
       corresponding to the terminating NULL wide-character  code
       is written.

       The  st_ctime  and  st_mtime  fields  of  the file will be
       marked for update  between  the  successful  execution  of
       fputws  and  the  next  successful completion of a call to
       fflush or fclose on the same stream or a call to  exit  or
       abort.

       Upon  successful completion, fputws returns a non-negative
       number.  Otherwise it returns -1, sets an error  indicator
       for the stream, and sets errno to indicate the error.
