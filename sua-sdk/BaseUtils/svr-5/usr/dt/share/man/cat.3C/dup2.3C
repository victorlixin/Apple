       fildes is a file descriptor referring to an open file, and
       fildes2 is a non-negative integer less  than  the  maximum
       number  of  open  files available.  dup2 causes fildes2 to
       refer to the same file  as  fildes.   If  fildes2  already
       referred  to an open file, not fildes, it is closed first.
       If fildes2 refers to fildes, or if fildes is not  a  valid
       open file descriptor, fildes2 will not be closed first.

       Upon successful completion a non-negative integer, namely,
       the file descriptor, is returned.  Otherwise, a  value  of
       -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       dup2  will  fail if one or more of the following are true:
       fildes is not a valid open file  descriptor.   fildes2  is
       negative or greater than or equal to the maximum number of
       open files available.  a signal was caught during the dup2
       call.   The  maximum  number  of file descriptors are cur-
       rently open.
