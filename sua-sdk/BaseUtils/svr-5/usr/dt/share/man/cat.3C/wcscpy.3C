       wcscpy  copies the wide string ws2 to the array ws1, stop-
       ping after the null wide character has  been  copied.  The
       behavior  is  undefined if copying occurs between overlap-
       ping objects.

   RReettuurrnn vvaalluuee
       wcscpy returns ws1.

UUssaaggee
       Overlapping moves may cause unexpected results because the
       movement  of wide character codes is implementation-depen-
       dent.
