       The  baud  rate  functions  get  and set the values of the
       input and output baud rates in the termios structure.  The
       effects  on  the  terminal  device  described below do not
       become effective until the tcsetattr function is  success-
       fully called.

       The  input and output baud rates are stored in the termios
       structure.  The baud rates that can be  represented  in  a
       termios structure are implementation specific, but include
       at least the following: 0, 300, 1200,  2400,  4800,  9600,
       19200, 38400, 57600, 115200 A baud rate of zero has a spe-
       cial interpretation. It it used to terminate (hang  up)  a
       connection.

       tcgetspeed gets the baud rate stored in the termios struc-
       ture pointed to by termios_p. It returns the input or out-
       put  baud  rate,  depending  on the value of type: get/set
       input baud rate get/set output baud rate get/set all  baud
       rates

       The  baud rate is returned as an integer (for example, 300
       is returned for 300 baud).  If tcgetspeed is  called  with
       TCS_ALL  and  the  input and output baud rates are not the
       same, it returns zero.

   ttccsseettssppeeeedd
       tcsetspeed sets the input and/or output baud  rate  stored
       in the termios structure pointed to by termios_p to speed.
       Both input and  output  rates  will  be  set  if  type  is
       TCS_ALL.   Otherwise  the  rate  not being set will remain
       unchanged.

       If the output baud rate is set to zero, the modem  control
       lines  will be de-asserted. Normally, this disconnects the
       line. Both baud rates must be set to non-zero values for a
       useable connection.

       Attempts  to  set baud rates or baud rate combinations not
       supported by either the termios representation or  by  the
       driver  are  ignored.  The previous baud rate setting will
       remain in effect.

       Zeroing all the bytes of a termios structure will have the

                                                                1
