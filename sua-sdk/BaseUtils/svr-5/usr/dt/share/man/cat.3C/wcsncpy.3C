       wcsncpy copies exactly n wide characters,  truncating  the
       wide  string ws2 or adding null wide characters to ws1, if
       necessary.  Wide characters that follow a null wide  char-
       acter  are not copied.  The result will not be null-termi-
       nated if the length of ws2 is n or more.  If the array ws2
       points  to is a wide character string that is shorter than
       n wide characters, the copy in the array pointed to by ws1
       is  padded  with  null  wide characters until a total of n
       wide characters is written.  This function does not  check
       for  an overflow condition of the array pointed to by ws1.

       wcsncpy returns ws1.

UUssaaggee
       Overlapping moves may cause unexpected results because the
       movement  of  wide characters is implementation-dependent.
       If there is no  null wide character in the  first  n  wide
       characters of the array pointed to by ws2, the result will
       not be null-terminated.
