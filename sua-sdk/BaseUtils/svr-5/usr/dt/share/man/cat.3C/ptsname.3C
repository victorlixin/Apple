       The function ptsname returns the name of the slave pseudo-
       terminal  device  associated with a master pseudo-terminal
       device.  fildes is a file descriptor returned from a  suc-
       cessful  open  of  the  master  device.  ptsname returns a
       pointer to a string containing  the  null-terminated  path
       name  of  the slave device of the form /dev/pts/N, where N
       is an integer between 0 and 255.

       Upon successful completion, the function ptsname returns a
       pointer to a string which is the name of the pseudo-termi-
       nal slave device.  This value points to a static data area
       that  is  overwritten by each call to ptsname.  Upon fail-
       ure, ptsname returns NULL.  This could occur if fildes  is
       an  invalid  file  descriptor  or if the slave device name
       does not exist in the file system.
