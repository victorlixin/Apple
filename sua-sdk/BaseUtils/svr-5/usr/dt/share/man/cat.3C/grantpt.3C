DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The function grantpt changes the mode and ownership of the
       slave pseudo-terminal device associated  with  its  master
       pseudo-terminal counter part.  fildes is the file descrip-
       tor returned from a successful open of the master  pseudo-
       terminal device.  A setuid root program [see is invoked to
       change the permissions.  The user ID of the slave  is  set
       to  the real owner of the calling process and the group ID
       is set to a reserved group.  The permission  mode  of  the
       slave  pseudo-terminal is set to readable, writable by the
       owner and writable by the group.

       Upon successful completion, the function  grantpt  returns
       0; otherwise it returns -1.

   EErrrroorrss
       Failure could occur if fildes is not an open file descrip-
       tor, if fildes is not associated with a master pseudo-ter-
       minal  device,  or if the corresponding slave device could
       not be accessed.
