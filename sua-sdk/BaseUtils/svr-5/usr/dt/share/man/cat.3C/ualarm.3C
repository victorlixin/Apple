DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The ualarm function causes the SIGALRM signal to be gener-
       ated for the calling process after the number of real-time
       microseconds  specified  by  the  useconds  argument   has
       elapsed.  When the interval argument is non-zero, repeated
       timeout notification occurs with a period in  microseconds
       specified by the interval argument.

       If  the  notification  signal,  SIGALRM,  is not caught or
       ignored, the calling process is terminated.

       Because of scheduling delays, resumption of  execution  of
       when  the  signal  is  caught  may be delayed an arbitrary
       amount.

       The ualarm function returns  the  number  of  microseconds
       remaining  from  the previous ualarm call.  If no timeouts
       are pending or if ualarm has not previously  been  called,
       ualarm returns 0.

       The ualarm function is a simplified interface to setitimer
       (see and uses the ITIMER_REAL interval timer.
