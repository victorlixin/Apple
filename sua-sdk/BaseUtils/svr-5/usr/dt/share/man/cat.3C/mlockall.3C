       The  function  mlockall  causes  all  pages  mapped  by an
       address space to be  locked  in  memory.   The  effect  of
       mlockall(flags)

       is equivalent to: memcntl(0, 0, MC_LOCKAS, flags, 0, 0)

       The  value  of  flags  determines  whether the pages to be
       locked are those currently mapped by  the  address  space,
       those  that  will  be  mapped in the future, or both: Lock
       current mappings Lock future mappings

       The function munlockall removes address  space  locks  and
       locks  on  mappings  in  the address space.  The effect of
       munlockall is equivalent to: memcntl(0, 0, MC_UNLOCKAS, 0,
       0, 0)

       Locks  established  with  mlockall  are not inherited by a
       child process after a fork and are not nested.

       Upon successful completion,  the  functions  mlockall  and
       munlockall  return  0;  otherwise,  they return -1 and set
       errno to indicate the error.
