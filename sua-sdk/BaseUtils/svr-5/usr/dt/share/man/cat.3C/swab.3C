       swab  copies  nbytes bytes pointed to by from to the array
       pointed to by to, exchanging adjacent even and odd  bytes.
       nbytes  should be even and non-negative.  If nbytes is odd
       and positive, swab uses nbytes-1 instead.   If  nbytes  is
       negative, swab does nothing.
