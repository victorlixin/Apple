       strtod returns as a double-precision floating-point number
       the value represented by the character string  pointed  to
       by  str.   The  string is scanned up to the first unrecog-
       nized character.

       strtod recognizes an optional  string  of  ``white-space''
       characters  [as  defined  by  isspace  in then an optional
       sign, then a string of digits optionally containing a dec-
       imal-point  character [as specified by the current locale;
       see then an optional exponent part including  an  e  or  E
       followed by an optional sign, followed by an integer.

       If  the  value  of ptr is not (char **)0, a pointer to the
       character terminating the scan is returned in the location
       pointed  to  by  ptr.  If no number can be formed, *ptr is
       set to str, and zero is returned.

       On the processors that support strtold, this  function  is
       equivalent  to  strtod, except that it returns a long dou-
       ble-precision floating-point number.

       atof(str) is equivalent to: strtod(str, (char **)0)

       If the correct value would cause overflow,  a  value  that
       compares equal to +-HUGE_VAL is returned (according to the
       sign of the value), and errno is set to ERANGE.

       If the  correct  value  would  cause  underflow,  zero  is
       returned and errno is set to ERANGE.

       When  the  -Xt  compilation  options are used [see a value
       that compares equal  to  +-HUGE  is  returned  instead  of
       +-HUGE_VAL.
