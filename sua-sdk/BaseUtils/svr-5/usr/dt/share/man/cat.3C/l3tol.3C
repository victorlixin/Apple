       l3tol converts a list of n three-byte integers packed into
       a character string pointed to by cp into a  list  of  long
       integers pointed to by lp.

       ltol3  performs  the reverse conversion from long integers
       (lp) to three-byte integers (cp).

       These functions are  useful  for  file-system  maintenance
       where the block numbers are three bytes long.

       Because  of  possible  differences  in  byte ordering, the
       numerical values of the long integers  are  machine-depen-
       dent.
