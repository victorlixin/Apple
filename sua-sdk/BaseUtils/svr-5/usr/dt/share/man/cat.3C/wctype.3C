       The  isw*  functions  tests whether wc is a wide-character
       code representing a character belonging  to  a  particular
       class in the program's current locale.  The LC_CTYPE cate-
       gory defines character class, case conversion,  and  other
       character attributes for a locale.

       Each function operates on a particluar class of wide char-
       acters, as shown in the table below.
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       iswalnum(wc)    wc is an alphanumeric wide character.
       iswalpha(wc)    wc is an alphabetic wide character.
       iswcntrlwc      wc is a control characters (not printable)
       iswdigit(wc)    wc is a wide character representing a digit.
       iswgraph(wc)    wc is a wide character representing a printable  charac-
                       ter, but does not include any white space.
       iswlower(wc)    wc is a lowercase wide character.
       iswprint(wc)    wc is a wide character representing a printing character
                       including white space.
       iswpunct(wc)    wc is a wide character representing a punctuation  char-
                       acter.
       iswspace(wc)    wc  is a wide character representing a white space char-
                       acter.
       iswupper(wc)    wc is an uppercase wide character.
       iswxdigit(wc)   wc is a wide character representing a hexadecimal digit.

       In all cases wc is a wint_t, the value of which must be  a
       wide-character  code corresponding to a valid character in
       the current locale or must equal the value  of  the  macro

                                                                1

       These functions returns non-zero if wc is a wide-character
       code of the appropriate class; otherwise they return 0.

UUssaaggee
       To ensure application portability, especially across natu-
       ral  languages,  only  these  functions should be used for
       classification of wide-character codes.
