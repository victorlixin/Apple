       div computes the quotient and remainder of the division of
       the numerator numer by the denominator denom.  This  func-
       tion  provides  a  well-defined  semantics  for the signed
       integral division and  remainder  operations,  unlike  the
       implementation-defined  semantics  of  the built-in opera-
       tions.  The sign of the resulting quotient is that of  the
       algebraic  quotient,  and, if the division is inexact, the
       magnitude of the resulting quotient is the largest integer
       less than the magnitude of the algebraic quotient.  If the
       result cannot be represented, the behavior  is  undefined;
       otherwise,  quotient * denom + remainder will equal numer.

       div returns a structure of type div_t, comprising both the
       quotient     and     remainder.     Its    members    are:
            int  quot;     /*quotient*/       int  rem; /*remain-
       der*/

       ldiv  is similar to div, except that the arguments and the
       members of the returned structure (which has type  ldiv_t)
       all have type long int.

       lldiv is similar to div, except that the arguments and the
       members of the returned structure (which has type lldiv_t)
       all have type long long.
