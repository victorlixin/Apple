       The usleep function suspends the current process from exe-
       cution for the number of  microseconds  specified  by  the
       useconds  argument.  Because of other activity, or because
       of the time spent in processing the call, the actual  sus-
       pension  time may be longer than the amount of time speci-
       fied.

       The useconds argument must be less than 1,000,000.  If the
       value of useconds is 0, then the call has no effect.

       The  usleep  function uses the process' real-time interval
       timer to indicate to the system when the process should be
       woken  up.  There is one real-time interval timer for each
       process.  The usleep function will not  interfere  with  a
       previous setting of this timer; the previous state of this
       timer is saved and restored.  If the process has set  this
       timer  prior  to calling usleep, and if the time specified
       by useconds equals or exceeds the interval  timer's  prior
       setting,  the  process will be woken up shortly before the
       original timer was set to expire and the signal is sent  a
       short time later.

       On successful completion, usleep returns 0.  Otherwise, it
       returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

EErrrroorrss
       The usleep function may fail  if:  The  useconds  argument
       specified 1,000,000 or more microseconds.

UUssaaggee
       This  routine  is implemented using setitimer and requires
       eight system calls each time it is invoked.

CCoommppaattiibbiilliittyy
       The usleep function is included for its historical  usage.
       The  setitimer  function  is preferred over this function.
