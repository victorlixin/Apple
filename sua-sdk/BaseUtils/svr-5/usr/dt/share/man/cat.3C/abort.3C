       abort  first  flushes any buffered data for all open stdio
       streams, directory streams, and message catalogue descrip-
       tors  (if  possible), then causes the signal SIGABRT to be
       sent to the calling process.  The open streams are flushed
       even if the current disposition for SIGABRT is ignore (see
       in this case, the disposition is changed  to  the  default
       for SIGABRT.

       If  SIGABRT is neither caught nor ignored, and the current
       directory is writable, a core dump is produced and a  mes-
       sage  similar  to  abort  -  core dumped is written by the
       shell [see
