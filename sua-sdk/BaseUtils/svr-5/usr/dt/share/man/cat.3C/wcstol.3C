       wcstol  returns,  as a long integer, the value represented
       by the character  string  pointed  to  by  nptr.   wcstoul
       returns,  as  an  unsigned  long integer, the value repre-
       sented by the character string pointed to  by  nptr.   The
       string  is  scanned up to the first character inconsistent
       with the base.   Leading  ``white-space''  characters  [as
       defined by iswspace] are ignored.

       If the value of endptr is not a null pointer, a pointer to
       the wide character terminating the scan is returned in the
       location  pointed  to  by  endptr.   If  no integer can be
       formed,  that  location  is  set  to  nptr,  and  zero  is
       returned.

       If  base is between 2 and 36, inclusive, it is used as the
       base for conversion.   After  an  optional  leading  sign,
       leading  zeros are ignored, and a leading ``0x'' or ``0X''
       is ignored if base is 16 and a leading 0b or 0B is ignored
       if base is 2.

       If  base is zero, the string itself determines the base as
       follows: After an optional leading  sign  a  leading  zero
       indicates octal conversion, and a leading ``0x'' or ``0X''
       hexadecimal conversion.  Otherwise, decimal conversion  is
       used.

       wcstoll  and  wcstoull are similar functions that return a
       long long or unsigned long long, respectively.

       For wcstol, if the value represented by nptr  would  cause
       overflow,  LONG_MAX  or LONG_MIN is returned (according to
       the sign of the value), and errno  is  set  to  the  value
       ERANGE.

       For  wcstoul, if the value represented by nptr would cause
       overflow, ULONG_MAX is returned, and errno is set  to  the
       value ERANGE.

                                                                1

wcstol(3C)                                             wcstol(3C)

       If  wcstol or wcstoul is given a base other than zero or 2
       through 36, it returns zero  and  sets  errno  to  EINVAL.
       Otherwise,  wcstol  and  wcstoul  return  the  represented
       value.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the following conditions, wcstol fails and  sets  errno
       to:  The  value  of  base is not supported.  No conversion
       could be performed.  The value to be returned is not  rep-
       resentable.
