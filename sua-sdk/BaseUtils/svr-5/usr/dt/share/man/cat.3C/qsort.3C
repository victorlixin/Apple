       qsort is an implementation of the quicker-sort  algorithm.
       It  sorts  a  table of data in place.  The contents of the
       table are sorted in ascending order according to the user-
       supplied comparison function.

       base  points to the element at the base of the table.  nel
       is the number of elements in the table.   width  specifies
       the  size of each element in bytes.  compar is the name of
       the comparison function, which is called  with  two  argu-
       ments  that  point  to  the  elements being compared.  The
       function must return an integer less than,  equal  to,  or
       greater  than zero to indicate if the first argument is to
       be considered less than, equal to,  or  greater  than  the
       second.

       The  contents  of  the table are sorted in ascending order
       according to the user supplied comparison function.

       The comparison function need not compare  every  byte,  so
       arbitrary  data  may be contained in the elements in addi-
       tion to the values being compared.

       The relative order in the output of two items that compare
       as equal is unpredictable.
