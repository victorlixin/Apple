       iswctype  checks  whether  the wide character wc is of the
       wide character class prop, the value of which is  returned
       by a previous successful call to wctype.  iswctype returns
       zero for false and non-zero for  true.   The  function  is
       defined  on  WEOF  and  wide characters that correspond to
       valid wide character encodings in the current  locale.   A
       change  to  the  LC_CTYPE  category  of the current locale
       invalidates an existing prop.

       wctype is defined for valid  wide  character  class  names
       that  have  a definition in the current locale.  charclass
       is a string  that  identifies  a  generic  wide  character
       class.   For this, codeset-specific information is needed.
       The wide character class names that are supported  in  all
       locales are listed below.

       iswctype  returns  zero  for  false  and nonzero for true.
       wctype returns a value that is of the type wctype_t.  This
       value  can then be used as a second argument to subsequent
       calls to iswctype.  If charclass is not supported,  wctype
       returns zero.

       The following twelve strings are reserved for the standard
       character classes:  "alnum",  "alpha",  "blank",  "cntrl",
       "digit",  "graph",  "lower",  "print",  "punct",  "space",
       "upper" and "xdigit".

       The functions found on the  left  are  equivalent  to  the
       iswctype  calls on the right.  iswalpha(wc)   iswctype(wc,
       wctype("alpha"))        iswupper(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("upper"))        iswlower(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("lower"))        iswdigit(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("digit"))        iswxdigit(wc)         iswctype(wc,
       wctype("xdigit"))       iswalnum(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("alnum"))        iswspace(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("space"))        iswpunct(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("punct"))        iswprint(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("print"))        iswgraph(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("graph"))        iswcntrl(wc)          iswctype(wc,
       wctype("cntrl"))

       There is no isw* function equivalent to  the  call:  iswc-
       type(wc, wctype("blank"))

                                                                1
