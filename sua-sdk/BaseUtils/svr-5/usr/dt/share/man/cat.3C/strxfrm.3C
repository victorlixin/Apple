       strxfrm  transforms the string s2 and places the resulting
       string into the array s1.  The transformation is such that
       if  strcmp  is  applied  to  two  transformed  strings, it
       returns a value greater than, equal to, or less than zero,
       corresponding  to  the  result  of  the  strcoll  function
       applied to the same two original strings.  The transforma-
       tion is based on the program's locale for category LC_COL-
       LATE [see

       No more than n characters will be placed into the  result-
       ing array pointed to by s1, including the terminating null
       character.  If n is 0, then s1 is permitted to be  a  null
       pointer.   If  copying  takes  place  between objects that
       overlap, the behavior is undefined.

       strxfrm returns the length of the transformed string  (not
       including  the  terminating null character).  If the value
       returned is n or more, the contents of the  array  s1  are
       indeterminate.

       The  value  of the following expression is the size of the
       array needed to hold  the  transformation  of  the  string
       pointed to by s.  1 + strxfrm(NULL, s, 0);
