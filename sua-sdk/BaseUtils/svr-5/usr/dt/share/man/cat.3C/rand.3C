       rand uses a multiplicative congruent random-number genera-
       tor with period 232 that returns successive  pseudo-random
       numbers  in  the  range  from  0  to  RAND_MAX (defined in
       stdlib.h).

       rand_r computes a sequence of  pseudo-random  integers  in
       the  range  0  to  RAND_MAX.  If rand_r is called with the
       same initial value for seed  and  the  value  of  seed  is
       unchanged  between successive returns and calls to rand_r,
       then the same sequence of random numbers are generated.

       The function srand uses the argument seed as a seed for  a
       new  sequence  of  pseudo-random numbers to be returned by
       subsequent calls to the function rand.   If  the  function
       srand  is  then  called  with  the  same  seed  value, the
       sequence of pseudo-random numbers will  be  repeated.   If
       the function rand is called before any calls to srand have
       been made, the same sequence will  be  generated  as  when
       srand is first called with a seed value of 1.

       The  spectral  properties  of rand and rand_r are limited.
       provides a much better, though more elaborate, random-num-
       ber generator.

       Each  thread  that  accesses one of the functions drand48,
       lrand48, mrand48, srand48, seed48, or  lcong48  should  be
       coded      as      per      the     following     example:
       mutex_lock(I_am_using_drand48);   value   =    FUNCTION();
       mutex_unlock(I_am_using_drand48);

       where  FUNCTION  is  one  of those listed.  The same mutex
       must be used for all six functions.

                                                                1
