       The  mkfifo  routine creates a new FIFO special file named
       by the pathname pointed to by path.  The mode of  the  new
       FIFO  is  initialized from mode.  The file permission bits
       of the mode argument are modified by  the  process's  file
       creation mask (see

       The FIFO's owner ID is set to the process's effective user
       ID.  The FIFO's group ID is set to the process's effective
       group  ID,  or  if  the  S_ISGID  bit is set in the parent
       directory then the group ID of the FIFO is inherited  from
       the parent.

       mkfifo calls the system call mknod to make the file.

       Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Oth-
       erwise, a value of -1 is returned  and  errno  is  set  to
       identify the error.
