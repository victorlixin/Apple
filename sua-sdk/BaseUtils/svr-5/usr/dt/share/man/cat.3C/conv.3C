       toupper  and tolower have as their domain the range of the
       function getc: all values represented in an unsigned  char
       and  the value of the macro EOF as defined in stdio.h.  If
       the argument of toupper represents a lowercase letter, the
       result  is  the  corresponding  uppercase  letter.  If the
       argument of tolower represents an  uppercase  letter,  the
       result  is  the corresponding lowercase letter.  All other
       arguments in the domain are returned unchanged.

       The macros  _toupper  and  _tolower  accomplish  the  same
       things  as  toupper  and  tolower,  respectively, but have
       restricted domains and are faster.   _toupper  requires  a
       lowercase letter as its argument; its result is the corre-
       sponding uppercase letter.  _tolower requires an uppercase
       letter  as  its  argument; its result is the corresponding
       lowercase letter.   Arguments  outside  the  domain  cause
       undefined results.

       toascii  yields its argument with all bits turned off that
       are not part of a standard 7-bit ASCII  character;  it  is
       intended for compatibility with other systems.

       toupper,  tolower,  _toupper,  and_tolower are affected by
       LC_CTYPE.  In the C locale, or in  a  locale  where  shift
       information  is not defined, these functions determine the
       case of characters according to the rules  of  the  ASCII-
       coded  character  set.  Characters outside the ASCII range
       of characters are returned unchanged.

       All the  conversion  functions  and  macros  use  a  table
       lookup.
