       cd_type  determines the type of a CD-ROM and indicates the
       CD-ROM type in the return value.  File or directory within
       the  CD-ROM  file system, or block special file containing
       the CD-ROM file system.

       On success, cd_type returns one of the  following  values:
       The  CD-ROM is recorded according to ISO-9660.  The CD-ROM
       is recorded according  to  High  Sierra.   The  CD-ROM  is
       recorded according to an unknown specification.

       On  failure, cd_type returns -1 and sets errno to indicate
       the error as follows: Search permission  is  denied  on  a
       component  of  path,  or  read permission is denied on the
       file, directory, or block special file that is pointed  to
       by  path.  Invalid address of path.  path points to a file
       or directory that is outside the CD-ROM file system.   The
       maximum  number of file descriptors are open.  The size of
       path exceeds MAXPATHLEN, or the component of a  path  name
       is  longer  than  MAXNAMELEN  while  _POSIX_NO_TRUNC is in
       effect.  The system file table is  full.   path  does  not
       exist  or  the path argument points to an empty string.  A
       component of path is not a directory.   path  is  a  block
       special  file  and  the device associated with it does not
       exist.  The CD-ROM is not in the drive  or  a  read  error
       occurred.
