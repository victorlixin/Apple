       sputl  takes  the four bytes of the long integer value and
       places them in memory starting at the address  pointed  to
       by  buffer.   The ordering of the bytes is the same across
       all machines.

       sgetl retrieves the four bytes in memory starting  at  the
       address  pointed to by buffer and returns the long integer
       value in the byte ordering of the host machine.

       The combination of sputl and  sgetl  provides  a  machine-
       independent  way of storing long numeric data in a file in
       binary form without conversion to characters.
