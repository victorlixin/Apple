       This  macro  is  useful  for putting diagnostics into pro-
       grams.  When  it  is  executed,  if  expression  is  false
       (zero),  assert  prints Assertion failed: expression, file
       xyz, line nnn

       on the standard error output and  aborts.   In  the  error
       message,  xyz  is  the name of the source file and nnn the
       source line number of the assert  statement.   The  latter
       are  respectively  the  values  of the preprocessor macros
       __FILE__ and __LINE__.

       Compiling with the preprocessor option  -DNDEBUG  [see  or
       with  the  preprocessor  control  statement #define NDEBUG
       ahead of the #include assert.h statement, will stop asser-
       tions from being compiled into the program.

       Since assert is implemented as a macro, the expression may
       not contain any string literals.
