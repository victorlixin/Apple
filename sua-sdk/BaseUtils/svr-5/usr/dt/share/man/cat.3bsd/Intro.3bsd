       This  manual  page section describes the routines that are
       provided for compatibility with Berkeley Systems Distribu-
       tion (BSD) systems.  They are intended to be accessed only
       using the /usr/ucb/cc compiler and are intended  for  com-
       patibility  with legacy Berkeley Systems Distribution sys-
       tems only.

       Routines with these names have been added to libc for con-
       formance  with the X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 4, Ver-
       sion 2.

       They are  provided  for  compatibility  with  applications
       originally written for BSD systems;  the equivalent System
       V routines should be used instead.

       These routines do not  conform  to  any  current  industry
       standard.   See  the  manual page sections given above for
       standard API routines that conform to  X/Open  Portability
       Guide, Issue 4, Version 2.
