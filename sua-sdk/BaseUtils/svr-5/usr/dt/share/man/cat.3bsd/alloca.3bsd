       alloca allocates size bytes of space in the stack frame of
       the caller, and returns a pointer to the allocated  block.
       This  temporary  space  is  automatically  freed  when the
       caller returns.  Note: if the allocated  block  is  beyond
       the  current  stack limit, the resulting behavior is unde-
       fined.

       alloca is machine-, compiler-, and most  of  all,  system-
       dependent.  Its use is strongly discouraged.
