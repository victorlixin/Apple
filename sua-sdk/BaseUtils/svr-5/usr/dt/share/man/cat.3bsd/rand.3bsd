       rand uses a multiplicative congruential random number gen-
       erator with period 232 to return successive  pseudo-random
       numbers in the range from 0 to 231-1.

       srand can be called at any time to reset the random-number
       generator to a random starting point.   The  generator  is
       initially seeded with a value of 1.

       The  spectral  properties of rand leave a great deal to be
       desired.  and provide much better, though more  elaborate,
       random-number generators.

       The low bits of the numbers generated are not very random;
       use the middle bits.  In particular the lowest bit  alter-
       nates between 0 and 1.
