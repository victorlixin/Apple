       These routines are provided for compatibility with  appli-
       cations originally written for BSD systems;  new or ported
       applications should use the equivalent System  V  routines
       instead.  See

       gethostname returns the standard host name for the current
       processor, as previously set by sethostname.  The  parame-
       ter  namelen specifies the size of the array pointed to by
       name.  The returned name is null-terminated unless  insuf-
       ficient space is provided.

       sethostname  sets the name of the host machine to be name,
       which has length namelen.  This call is restricted to  the
       privileged  user and is normally used only when the system
       is bootstrapped.

       If the call succeeds a value of 0  is  returned.   If  the
       call  fails,  then  a value of -1 is returned and an error
       code is placed in the global location errno.

   EErrrroorrss
       The following error may be returned by  these  calls:  The
       name  or  namelen  parameter gave an invalid address.  The
       caller was not the privileged user.  Note: this error only
       applies to sethostname.

       Host  names are limited to MAXHOSTNAMELEN characters, cur-
       rently 256.  (See the param.h header file.)
