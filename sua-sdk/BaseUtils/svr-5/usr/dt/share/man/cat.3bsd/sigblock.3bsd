       sigblock  adds the signals specified in mask to the set of
       signals currently being blocked  from  delivery.   Signals
       are  blocked  if  the  appropriate bit in mask is a 1; the
       macro sigmask is provided to  construct  the  mask  for  a
       given  signum.   The previous mask is returned, and may be
       restored using

       It is not possible to block SIGKILL, SIGSTOP, or  SIGCONT;
       this restriction is silently imposed by the system.
