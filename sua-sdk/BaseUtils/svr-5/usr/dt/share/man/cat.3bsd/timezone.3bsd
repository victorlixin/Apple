       timezone  attempts  to  return  the  name of the time zone
       associated with its first argument, which is  measured  in
       minutes  westward  from Greenwich.  If the second argument
       is 0, the standard name is used,  otherwise  the  Daylight
       Savings  Time  version.   If  the  required  name does not
       appear in a table built into the routine,  the  difference
       from  GMT  is produced; for instance, in Afghanistan time-
       zone(-(60*4+30), 0) is  appropriate  because  it  is  4:30
       ahead of GMT and the string GMT+4:30 is produced.

       The  offset  westward  from Greenwich and an indication of
       whether Daylight Savings Time is in effect may not be suf-
       ficient  to  determine  the  name of the time zone, as the
       name may differ between different locations  in  the  same
       time  zone.   Instead  of  using timezone to determine the
       name of the time zone for a given time, that  time  should
       be  converted  to a struct tm using localtime [see and the
       tm_zone field of that structure should be used.   timezone
       is retained for compatibility with existing programs.
