       times  returns time-accounting information for the current
       process and for the terminated child processes of the cur-
       rent  process.  All times are in 1/HZ seconds, where HZ is
       60.

       This is the structure filled in by  times:  struct  tms  {
            time_t    tms_utime;     /*      user     time     */
            time_t    tms_stime;     /*    system     time     */
            time_t    tms_cutime;    /*  user  time,  children */
            time_t    tms_cstime;    /* system time, children  */
       };

       The children's times are the sum of the children's process
       times and their children's times.
