       fopen opens the file named by filename  and  associates  a
       stream  with  it.   If  the open succeeds, fopen returns a
       pointer to be used to identify the  stream  in  subsequent
       operations.

       filename  points  to  a character string that contains the
       name of the file to be opened.

       type is a character string having  one  of  the  following
       values:  open  for  reading truncate or create for writing
       append: open for writing at end of  file,  or  create  for
       writing  open for update (reading and writing) truncate or
       create for update append; open or create for update at EOF

       freopen  opens  the  file named by filename and associates
       the stream pointed to by stream with it.  The  type  argu-
       ment  is  used  just  as in fopen.  The original stream is
       closed, regardless of whether  the  open  ultimately  suc-
       ceeds.  If the open succeeds, freopen returns the original
       value of stream.

       freopen is typically used to attach the preopened  streams
       associated  with stdin, stdout, and stderr to other files.

       fdopen  associates  a  stream  with  the  file  descriptor
       fildes.   File  descriptors  are  obtained from calls like
       open, dup, creat, or which open files but  do  not  return
       streams.  Streams are necessary input for many of the Sec-
       tion 3S library routines.  The type  of  the  stream  must
       agree with the mode of the open file.

       When  a  file  is opened for update, both input and output
       may be done on the resulting stream.  However, output  may
       not  be  directly followed by input without an intervening
       fseek or rewind, and input may not be directly followed by
       output  without  an intervening fseek, rewind, or an input
       operation which encounters EOF.

       The BSD System Compatibility Package fopen and freopen are
       identical to the routines  in  libc  with  one  exception.
       When  type  is  a, fopen and freopen insists that the file
       position indicator for the stream be set  to  the  end  of
       file.
