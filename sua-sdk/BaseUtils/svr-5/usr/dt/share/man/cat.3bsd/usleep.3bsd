       Suspend the current process for the number of microseconds
       specified by the argument.  The actual suspension time may
       be an arbitrary amount longer because of other activity in
       the system, or because of the time spent in processing the
       call.

       The  routine  is  implemented by setting an interval timer
       and pausing until it occurs.  The previous state  of  this
       timer  is  saved  and restored.  If the sleep time exceeds
       the time to the expiration of the previous timer, the pro-
       cess sleeps only until the signal would have occurred, and
       the signal is sent a short time later.

       This  routine  is  implemented  using  setitimer  (see  it
       requires eight system calls each time it is invoked.
