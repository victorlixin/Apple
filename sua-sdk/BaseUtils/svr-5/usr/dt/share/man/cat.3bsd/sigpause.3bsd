       sigpause  assigns sigmask to the set of masked signals and
       then waits for a signal to arrive; on return  the  set  of
       masked signals is restored.  sigmask is usually 0 to indi-
       cate that no signals are  now  to  be  blocked.   sigpause
       always terminates by being interrupted, returning EINTR.

       In  normal  usage,  a  signal  is blocked using to begin a
       critical section, variables modified on the occurrence  of
       the signal are examined to determine that there is no work
       to be done, and the process pauses awaiting work by  using
       sigpause with the mask returned by sigblock.
