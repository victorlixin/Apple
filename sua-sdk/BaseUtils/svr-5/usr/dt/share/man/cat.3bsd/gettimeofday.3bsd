       The  system's  notion  of  the  current  Greenwich time is
       obtained with the gettimeofday call, and set with the set-
       timeofday  call.  The current time is expressed in elapsed
       seconds and microseconds since 00:00 GMT, January 1,  1970
       (zero  hour).  The resolution of the system clock is hard-
       ware dependent; the time may be updated  continuously,  or
       in ``ticks.''

       tp  points to a timeval structure, which includes the fol-
       lowing members: long tv_sec;   /* seconds  since  Jan.  1,
       1970 */ long tv_usec;  /* and microseconds */

       If  tp  is a NULL pointer, the current time information is
       not returned or set.

       tzp is an obsolete pointer formerly used to  get  and  set
       time  zone  information.   tzp  is now ignored.  Time zone
       information is now handled using the TZ environment  vari-
       able; see

       Only the privileged user may set the time of day.

       A  -1  return  value  indicates an error occurred; in this
       case an error code is stored in the global variable errno.

       The  following  error codes may be set in errno: tp speci-
       fies an invalid time.  A user other  than  the  privileged
       user attempted to set the time.

       Time  is  never  correct enough to believe the microsecond
       values.

       tzp is ignored.
