       reboot reboots the system, and is invoked automatically in
       the event of unrecoverable system failures.   howto  is  a
       mask of options passed to the bootstrap program.  The sys-
       tem call interface permits only RB_HALT or RB_AUTOBOOT  to
       be  passed to the reboot program; the other flags are used
       in scripts stored on the console storage media, or used in
       manual  bootstrap  procedures.  When none of these options
       (for  instance  RB_AUTOBOOT)  is  given,  the  system   is
       rebooted  from file /stand/unix.  An automatic consistency
       check of the disks is then normally performed.

       The bits of howto that are used are: the processor is sim-
       ply halted; no reboot takes place.  RB_HALT should be used
       with  caution.   Interpreted  by  the  bootstrap   program
       itself,  causing  it  to inquire as to what file should be
       booted.  Normally, the system  is  booted  from  the  file
       /stand/unix without asking.

       If  successful,  this call never returns.  Otherwise, a -1
       is returned and an error is returned in the  global  vari-
       able errno as follows:

       The caller is not the super-user.

       Any other howto argument causes /stand/unix to boot.

       Only the super-user may reboot a machine.
