       utimes  sets the access and modification times of the file
       named by file.

       If tvp is NULL, the access and modification times are  set
       to  the  current time.  A process must be the owner of the
       file or have write permission for the file to  use  utimes
       in this manner.

       If  tvp is not NULL, it is assumed to point to an array of
       two timeval structures.  The access time  is  set  to  the
       value  of  the  first member, and the modification time is
       set to the value of the second member.  Only the owner  of
       the  file  or  the  privileged user may use utimes in this
       manner.

       In either case, the inode-changed time of the file is  set
       to the current time.

       Upon  successful  completion,  a  value  of 0 is returned.
       Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and errno is  set  to
       indicate the error.

       utimes will fail if one or more of the following are true:
       A component of the path prefix of file is not a directory.
       The  length of a component of file exceeds 255 characters,
       or the length of file exceeds 1023 characters.   The  file
       referred  to by file does not exist.  Search permission is
       denied for a component of the path prefix  of  file.   Too
       many  symbolic links were encountered in translating file.
       The effective user ID of the  process  is  not  privileged
       user  and  not the owner of the file, and tvp is not NULL.
       The effective user ID of the  process  is  not  privileged
       user  and  not  the owner of the file, write permission is
       denied for the file,  and  tvp  is  NULL.   An  I/O  error
       occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
       The file system containing the file is mounted  read-only.
       file or tvp points outside the process's allocated address
       space.

       utimes is a library routine that calls the system call.
