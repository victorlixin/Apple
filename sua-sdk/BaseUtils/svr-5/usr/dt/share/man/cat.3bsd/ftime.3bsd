       The  ftime  entry  fills  in a structure pointed to by its
       argument, as defined  by  <sys/timeb.h>:  struct  timeb  {
            time_t    time;         unsigned    short    millitm;
            short     timezone;      short     dstflag; };

       The structure contains the time since the  epoch  in  sec-
       onds,  up  to  1000 milliseconds of more-precise interval,
       the local time zone (measured in minutes of time  westward
       from  Greenwich),  and  a flag that, if nonzero, indicates
       that Daylight  Saving  time  applies  locally  during  the
       appropriate part of the year.
