       sleep  suspends the current process from execution for the
       number of seconds specified by the argument.   The  actual
       suspension  time  may  be  up  to  1 second less than that
       requested, because scheduled wakeups occur at fixed 1-sec-
       ond  intervals,  and  may  be  an  arbitrary amount longer
       because of other activity in the system.

       sleep is implemented by  setting  an  interval  timer  and
       pausing  until  it  expires.   The  previous state of this
       timer is saved and restored.  If the  sleep  time  exceeds
       the  time  to  the expiration of the previous value of the
       timer, the process sleeps only until the timer would  have
       expired,  and  the signal which occurs with the expiration
       of the timer is sent one second later.
