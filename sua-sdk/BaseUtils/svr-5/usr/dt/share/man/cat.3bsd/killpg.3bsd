       killpg  sends  the  signal  sig to the process group pgrp.
       See for a list of signals.

       The real or effective user ID of the sending process  must
       match  the real or saved set-user ID of the receiving pro-
       cess, unless the effective user ID of the sending  process
       is  the privileged user.  A single exception is the signal
       SIGCONT, which may always be sent to any descendant of the
       current process.

       Upon  successful  completion,  a  value  of 0 is returned.
       Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and the global  vari-
       able errno is set to indicate the error.

       killpg  will fail and no signal will be sent if any of the
       following occur: sig is not a  valid  signal  number.   No
       processes  were found in the specified process group.  The
       effective user ID of the sending process is not privileged
       user,  and  neither its real nor effective user ID matches
       the real or saved set-user ID of one or more of the target
       processes.
