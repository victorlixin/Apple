       psignal  produces  a  short  message on the standard error
       file describing the indicated signal.  First the  argument
       string  s  is  printed, then a colon, then the name of the
       signal and a NEWLINE.  Most usefully, the argument  string
       is the name of the program which incurred the signal.  The
       signal number should be from among those  found  in  <sig-
       nal.h>.

       To simplify variant formatting of signal names, the vector
       of message strings sys_siglist  is  provided;  the  signal
       number  can  be  used as an index in this table to get the
       signal name without the newline.  The define NSIG  defined
       in  signal.h is the number of messages provided for in the
       table; it should be checked because  new  signals  may  be
       added to the system before they are added to the table.
