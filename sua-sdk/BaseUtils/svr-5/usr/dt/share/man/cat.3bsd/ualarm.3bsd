       ualarm  sends  signal SIGALRM (see to the invoking process
       in a number of microseconds given by the  value  argument.
       Unless  caught  or ignored, the signal terminates the pro-
       cess.

       If the interval argument is non-zero, the  SIGALRM  signal
       will  be  sent  to the process every interval microseconds
       after  the  timer  expires  (for  instance,  after   value
       microseconds have passed).

       Because  of  scheduling delays, resumption of execution of
       when the signal is caught  may  be  delayed  an  arbitrary
       amount.   The longest specifiable delay time is 2147483647
       microseconds.

       The return value is the amount of time previously  remain-
       ing in the alarm clock.
