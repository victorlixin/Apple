       re_comp  compiles  a string into an internal form suitable
       for pattern matching.  re_exec checks the argument  string
       against the last string passed to re_comp.

       re_comp  returns  a  null pointer if the string s was com-
       piled successfully; otherwise a string containing an error
       message  is  returned.   If  re_comp is passed 0 or a null
       string, it returns without changing the currently compiled
       regular expression.

       re_exec  returns  1  if the string s matches the last com-
       piled regular expression, 0 if  the  string  s  failed  to
       match  the last compiled regular expression, and -1 if the
       compiled regular expression  was  invalid  (indicating  an
       internal error).

       The  strings  passed  to both re_comp and re_exec may have
       trailing or embedded NEWLINE characters; they  are  termi-
       nated  by null characters.  The regular expressions recog-
       nized are described in the manual page entry for given the
       above difference.
