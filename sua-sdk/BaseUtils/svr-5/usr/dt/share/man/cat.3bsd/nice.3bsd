       The  scheduling  priority  of  the process is augmented by
       incr.  Positive priorities get less service  than  normal.
       Priority  10  is  recommended to users who want to execute
       long-running programs without undue impact on system  per-
       formance.

       Negative  increments are invalid, except when specified by
       the privileged user.  The priority is limited to the range
       -20  (most  urgent)  to  20  (least).  Requests for values
       above or below these limits result in the scheduling  pri-
       ority being set to the corresponding limit.

       The  priority of a process is passed to a child process by
       For a privileged process to return to normal priority from
       an  unknown state, nice should be called successively with
       arguments -40 (goes to priority  -20  because  of  trunca-
       tion), 20 (to get to 0), then 0 (to maintain compatibility
       with previous versions of this call).

       Upon successful completion, nice returns 0.  Otherwise,  a
       value  of  -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the
       error.

       The priority is not changed if: The value of  incr  speci-
       fied  was  negative,  and the effective user ID is not the
       privileged user.
