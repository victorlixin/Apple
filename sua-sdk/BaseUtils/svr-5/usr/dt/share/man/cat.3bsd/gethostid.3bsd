       This  routine  is provided for compatibility with applica-
       tions originally written for BSD systems;  new  or  ported
       applications  should  use the equivalent System V routines
       instead.  See

       gethostid returns the 32-bit identifier  for  the  current
       host, which should be unique across all hosts. This number
       is usually taken from the CPU board's ID PROM.
