       The  VipNSGetHostByName  routine maps string names to net-
       work addresses that are recognized by the and routines for
       connection  operations. Name matching is case-insensitive.

       The name service is queried and returns an address in  the
       context  of  the  specified VI NIC. If this operation com-
       pletes successfully, a valid VIP_NET_ADDRESS structure  is
       contained  in  the  network address structure specified by
       the Address parameter. This structure must be allocated by
       the calling process with the HostAddressLen field initial-
       ized.

       The NameIndex parameter is used to allow the name  service
       to  associate multiple NIC addresses with the same name on
       a System Area Network (SAN), as specified by the NicHandle
       parameter.  For example, if a node on a single SAN has two
       NICs to allow for twice the bandwidth and  number  of  VIs
       that a single NIC would have, the first call to VipNSGetH-
       ostByName (with  NameIndex  set  to  0)  returns  one  NIC
       address.   The second call (with a NameIndex of 1) returns
       the other NIC address. A  VIP_ERROR_NAMESERVICE  error  is
       returned  by  a  call  to VipNSGetHostByName with the same
       name but a NameIndex of 2 or more.

       fied host. The HostAddress field must be at least the size
       specified    by    the    NICAddressLen   field   in   the
       VIP_NET_ATTRIBUTES structure.  The index of NIC address to
       return.  If  a node has multiple NICs on a particular SAN,
       the client application can start at a NameIndex of 0,  and
       increment  the  index  until an error is returned to fully
       enumerate all of the NIC addresses associated with a  par-
       ticular node name.

       The  operation completed successfully.  The name specified
       was not found by the name service, the NameIndex parameter
       for the given name is invalid, or the name service was not
       initialized for the specified NIC  context.   One  of  the
       parameters  was  invalid.   An error was detected that was
       caused by insufficient resources.
