       The  VipCreateCQ  routine  creates a new completion queue.
       The calling  process  must  specify  how  many  completion
       entries  the queue must contain. If successful, it returns
       a handle to the newly created completion queue.

       A completion queue is created with at least the  specified
       number  of completion entries. To avoid dropped completion
       notifications, applications should ensure that the  number
       of notifications posted on the work queues associated with
       a completion queue does not exceed  the  completion  queue
       capacity  at  any  time.  In a multi-threaded environment,
       this can be done by using atomic increment/decrement vari-
       ables to track the availability of work queue space.

       A new completion queue was successfully created.  The  NIC
       handle  was  invalid.   The  completion queue could not be
       created due to insufficient resources.
