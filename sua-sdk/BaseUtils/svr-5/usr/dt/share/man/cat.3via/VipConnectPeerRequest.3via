       VIP_RETURN VipConnectPeerRequest(VIP_VI_HANDLE ViHandle,
            VIP_NET_ADDRESS      *LocalAddr,      VIP_NET_ADDRESS

            VIP_ULONG TimeOut);

       The  VipConnectPeerRequest  routine  is  used  to  post  a
       request that a connection be established between the local
       VI  endpoint  and  a  remote VI endpoint. Local and remote
       network addresses are specified as a part of  the  connec-
       tion request. The routine returns immediately after initi-
       ation of the request. Subsequent calls can check the  sta-
       tus of the request (the routine) or wait for completion of
       the request (the routine).

       If a connection is  successfully  established,  the  local
       address  is  bound  to  the  local  VI  endpoint  and  the
       attributes of the remote  endpoint  are  returned  to  the
       calling  process  when  connection  completion  status  is
       delivered. If a connection cannot  be  established  before
       TimeOut  elapses,  a  VIP_TIMEOUT error is returned in the
       return status of  VipConnectPeerDone  and  VipConnectPeer-
       Wait.

       The  the  host portion of the LocalAddr parameter does not
       match the local NIC address (as specified in the  LocalNi-
       cAddress  field  of  the  NicAttributes structure), then a
       VIP_INVALID_PARAMETER error is returned.

       The handle for the local VI endpoint.  The  local  network
       address.  This is used solely for administrative purposes,
       and is not used for matching connection requests. The host
       portion  of  this  parameter must match the NIC's address.
       The remote network address.  The count, specified in  mil-
       liseconds,  that  VipConnectPeerRequest  will wait for the
       connection to complete before  returning  to  the  calling
       process.  If no timeout is required, this should be set to
       VIP_INFINITE. A TimeOut value  of  zero  is  invalid,  and
       returns a VIP_INVALID_PARAMETER error.

       The  connection request was successfully queued.  An error
       was detected that was caused  by  insufficient  resources.
       The  specified  VI  endpoint is not in the Idle state (see
       for details of the supported states).  One of the  parame-
       ters was invalid.
