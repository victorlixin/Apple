       The VipConnectAccept routine is used to accept  a  connec-
       tion request, and to associate the connection with a local
       VI endpoint. It is called on the server side of  the  con-
       nection model.

       The calling process passes the handle of an unconnected VI
       endpoint (which must be in the Idle state) to  be  associ-
       ated with the connection request. If the attributes of the
       local VI endpoint conflict with those of the  remote  end-
       point,  VipConnectAccept  fails. It is the function of the
       VI provider to determine if the connection should succeed,
       based  on  the  attributes of the two endpoints. Note that
       the VI attributes that must match  when  establishing  the
       connection  are:  ReliabilityLevel  MaxTransferSize QoS If
       VipConnectAccept fails, no explicit notification  is  sent
       to  the remote endpoint. The calling process may choose to
       modify the attributes of the local VI  endpoint,  and  try
       again.

       In  order  to reject a connection request, the VI consumer
       must explicitly reject the  connection  request,  using  a
       call to the routine.

       For   NICs   that   can   detect   network  partitions,  a
       VIP_NOT_REACHABLE error is returned if a network partition
       is detected. For Reliable Delivery and Reliable Reception,
       the VI transitions to the Error state (see  for  details),
       and any pending receive descriptors are marked as flushed.

       The  connection  was successfully established.  One of the
       parameters was invalid.  The reliability  level  attribute
       of  the  local endpoint conflicted with that of the remote
       VI.  The maximum transfer size attribute of the local end-
       point  conflicted  with  that of the remote endpoint.  The
       specified quality of service  attribute  was  invalid,  or
       conflicted  with that of the remote endpoint.  The connec-
       tion could not be completed, possibly  due  to  a  timeout
       failure  of the matching call.  An error was detected that
       was caused by insufficient resources.   The  specified  VI
       endpoint  is not in the Idle state (see for details of the
       supported states).  A network partition was detected.
