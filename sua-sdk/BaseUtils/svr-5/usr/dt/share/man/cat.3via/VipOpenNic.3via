       The VipOpenNic routine associates a process with a VI NIC,
       and provides a NIC handle to the VI consumer.  The  handle
       is  used by subsequent library functions to specify a par-
       ticular NIC.

       A process is permitted to open the same  VI  NIC  multiple
       times.  Each time a process calls VipOpenNic with the same
       device name, a different NIC handle is returned that  ref-
       erences the same NIC.

       Symbolic name of the device (VI Provider instance) associ-
       ated with the NIC.  The handle  returned.  The  handle  is
       used by the other library routines to specify a particular
       instance of a VI NIC.
