DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The VipCreatePtag routine is used to create a new  protec-
       tion  tag for the calling process. The tag is subsequently
       associated with VI endpoints by way of calls to  the  rou-
       tine, and with memory regions using the routine. A process
       may request multiple protection tags.

       For all memory references by the  VI  provider  (including
       descriptors and memory buffers), the protection tag of the
       VI instance, and the memory region, must match in order to
       pass the memory protection check.

       The protection tag is an element in the VI attributes data
       structure (see the <vipl.h> header  file  and  the  manual
       page  for  details). The protection tag of a memory region
       and/or a VI can be changed by changing their attributes.

       The  memory  protection  tag was successfully created.  An
       error  was  detected  that  was  caused  by   insufficient
       resources.  One of the parameters was invalid.
