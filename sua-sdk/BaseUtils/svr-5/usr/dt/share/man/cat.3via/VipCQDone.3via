       The VipCQDone routine polls the specified completion queue
       for a completion entry (a completed operation). If such an
       entry  is  found,  VipCQDone  returns the VI handle, along
       with a flag to indicate whether the  completed  descriptor
       resides in the send or receive queue.

       VipCQDone  is  a  non-blocking  routine. In particular, it
       cannot block behind a call to even in a threads-safe envi-
       ronment.

       It  is the responsibility of the calling process to subse-
       quently call an appropriate routine to de-queue  the  com-
       pleted  descriptor (one of or VipCQDone only de-queues the
       completion queue entry.

       Where a process has multiple threads, some may be  waiting
       for  completions  on  a completion queue, while others are
       polling the work queues of the associated VI.  In  such  a
       case,  the  calling process must be prepared to handle the
       completion queue indicating a completion, followed by  the
       failure of a subsequent operation to de-queue the descrip-
       tor.

       If a process has associated a  VI  instance's  work  queue
       with a completion queue, it may not block directly on that
       work queue using the or routines.
