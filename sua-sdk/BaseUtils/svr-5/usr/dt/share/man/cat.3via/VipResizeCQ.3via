       The  VipResizeCQ  routine modifies the size of a specified
       completion queue by specifying the new number  of  comple-
       tion  entries that it must hold. This routine is useful in
       situations  where  the  potential  number  of   completion
       entries  that could be placed on the queue changes dynami-
       cally.
