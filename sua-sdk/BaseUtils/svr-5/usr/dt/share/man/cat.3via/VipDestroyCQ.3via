DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The VipDestroyCQ routine destroys a  specified  completion
       queue. If any VI work queues (send or receive) are associ-
       ated with the completion queue, the  completion  queue  is
       not destroyed, and an error is returned.

       The handle of the completion queue to be destroyed.

RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       The completion queue was successfully destroyed.  The com-
       pletion queue handle was invalid.   The  completion  queue
       could  not  be destroyed because the work queues of one or
       more VI instances are still associated with it.
