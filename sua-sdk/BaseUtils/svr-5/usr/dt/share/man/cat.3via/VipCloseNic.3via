DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The VipCloseNic routine removes the association between  a
       consumer  process and a VI NIC, as originally created by a
       previous call to the routine.

       When the VI NIC is closed, it is the responsibility of the
       VI provider to clean up all resources associated with that
       NIC instance. This includes any resources allocated by the
       library  and threads started on behalf of the NIC, such as
       error callback and notify threads.

       The operation was completed successfully.  The  specifica-
       tion of the NicHandle parameter was invalid.
