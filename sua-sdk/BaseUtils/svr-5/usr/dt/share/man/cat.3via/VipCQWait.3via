       The VipCQWait routine polls the specified completion queue
       for a completion entry (a completed operation). If such an
       entry  is  found,  VipCQWait  returns the VI handle, along
       with a flag to indicate the send or receive queue in which
       the completed descriptor resides.

       If  no  completion  entry is found, the calling process is
       blocked until a completion entry is  generated,  or  until
       the timeout value expires.

       It  is the responsibility of the calling process to subse-
       quently call an appropriate routine to de-queue  the  com-
       pleted  descriptor (one of or VipCQWait only de-queues the
       completion entry from the completion queue.

       Where a process has multiple threads, some may be  waiting
       for  completions  on  a completion queue, while others are
       polling the work queues of the associated VI.  In  such  a
       case,  the  calling process must be prepared to handle the
       completion queue indicating a completion, followed by  the
       failure of a subsequent operation to de-queue the descrip-
       tor.

       If a process has associated a  VI  instance's  work  queue
       with a completion queue, it may not block directly on that
       work queue using the or routines. If  this  is  attempted,
       VIP_ERROR_RESOURCE is returned.

       The  handle  of  the completion queue.  The number of mil-
       liseconds to block before returning control to the calling
       process.  This should be set to VIP_INFINITE if no timeout
       is required.  The handle of  the  VI  endpoint  associated
       with  the  completion, if the return status indicated suc-
       cess.  This  is  returned  to  the  calling  process.   If
       VIP_TRUE,  this  indicates that the completion was associ-
       ated with the receive queue of the VI. If VIP_FALSE,  this
       indicates that the completion was associated with the send
       queue.  This is undefined if the returned status

       A completion entry was found on the completion queue.  The
