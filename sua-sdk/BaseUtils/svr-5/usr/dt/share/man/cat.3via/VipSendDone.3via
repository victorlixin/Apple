       The VipSendDone routine checks whether the  descriptor  at
       the  head  of  a  VI's send queue has been marked as being
       complete. If the operation has completed,  the  descriptor
       is  removed from the head of the queue, and the address of
       the descriptor  is  returned.  A  VIP_DESCRIPTOR_ERROR  is
       returned  if  the operation completed with errors returned
       in the descriptor's status, or if the send queue is empty.
       If the latter, DescriptorPtr is set to NULL.

       VipSendDone  is  a non-blocking routine. In particular, it
       cannot block behind a call to even in a threads-safe envi-
       ronment.

       A completed descriptor was returned.  If the send queue is
       empty,  the  descriptor is set to NULL.  Otherwise, a com-
       pleted descriptor is returned  with  an  error  completion
       status.  No completed descriptor was found.  The VI handle
       was invalid.
