       The VipConnectRequest routine is used to  request  that  a
       connection  be  established  between the local VI endpoint
       and a remote endpoint. It is called on the client side  of
       the connection model. The LocalAddr and RemoteAddr parame-
       ters are both network addresses. Only the  remote  network
       address is used by the server to match to a

       When  a connection is successfully established, the speci-
       fied local address is bound to the local VI endpoint,  and
       the  attributes  of  the remote endpoint are passed to the
       calling process. These allow the calling process to deter-
       mine whether the indicated RDMA operations can be executed
       over the resulting connection.

       If the remote end explicitly  rejects  the  connection  by
       calling  a  rejection error is returned by way of explicit
       notification. If  the  specified  TimeOut  period  expires
       before  the  connection can be established a timeout error
       is returned. A TimeOut  value  of  zero  is  invalid,  and
       results  in an immediate VIP_INVALID_PARAMETER error being
       returned. If a  or  a  VipConnectReject  response  is  not
       returned  withing  the specified timeout period (including
       the case of a non-functional  server  or  network  connec-
       tion),  VIP_TIMEOUT  is  returned after the timeout period
       expires. If the server is responding, but not waiting  for
       a  connection  that  matches  the discriminator portion of
       LocalAddr, or is not  in  a  state  to  handle  connection
       requests, a VIP_NO_MATCH error is returned.

       For   NIC's   that   can   detect  network  partitions,  a
       VIP_NOT_REACHABLE error is returned if a network partition
       is detected. For Reliable Delivery and Reliable Reception,
       the VI transitions to the Error state (see  for  details),
       and any pending receive descriptors are marked as flushed.

       If the host portion of the LocalAddr  parameter  does  not
       match  the local NIC address (the LocalNicAddress field of
       the NicAttributes structure), a VIP_INVALID_ADDRESS  error
       is returned.

       The connection was successfully established.  The  connec-
       tion  operation timed out.  An error was detected that was
       caused by insufficient resources.  One of  the  parameters
       was  invalid.   The  connection was rejected by the remote
       end.  The server is up but is not waiting for a connection
       request  with  the specified discriminator.  The specified
       VI endpoint is not in the Idle state (see for details).  A
       network partition was detected.
