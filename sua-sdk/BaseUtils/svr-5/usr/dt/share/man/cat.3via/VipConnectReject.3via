       The VipConnectReject routine is used to reject  a  connec-
       tion  request. It is called on the server side of the con-
       nection model.  Notification is sent  to  the  remote  end
       that the associated connection was rejected.

       For   NICs   that   can   detect   network  partitions,  a
       VIP_NOT_REACHABLE error is returned if a network partition
       is detected. For Reliable Delivery and Reliable Reception,
       the VI transitions to the Error state (see  for  details),
       and any pending receive descriptors are marked as flushed.

       The   operation  completed  successfully.   The  specified
       ConnHandle parameter was invalid.  An error  was  detected
       that was caused by insufficient resources.  A network par-
       tition was detected.
