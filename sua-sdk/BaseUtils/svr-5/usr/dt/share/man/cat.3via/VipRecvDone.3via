       The VipRecvDone routine checks whether the  descriptor  at
       the  head of a VI's receive queue has been marked as being
       complete. If the receive has completed, the descriptor  is
       removed from the head of the queue, and the address of the
       descriptor is returned. A VIP_DESCRIPTOR_ERROR is returned
       if  the  operation  completed  with errors returned in the
       descriptor's status, or if the receive queue was empty. If
       the latter, DescriptorPtr is set to NULL.

       VipRecvDone  is  a non-blocking routine. In particular, it
       cannot block behind a call to even in a threads-safe envi-
       ronment.

       A completed  receive  descriptor  was  returned.   If  the
       receive  queue  is empty, the descriptor pointer is set to
       NULL. Otherwise, a completed descriptor is  returned  with
       an  error  completion status.  No completed descriptor was
       found.  The VI handle was invalid.
