       The VipSetMemAttributes routine modifies the attributes of
       a  registered  memory  region. If the VI provider does not
       support the requested attributes, an  error  is  returned.
       Modifying  the  attributes of a memory region while a data
       transfer that refers to that region  is  in  progress  can
       result in undefined behavior and should be avoided.

       When  an  error  is  returned,  none of the attributes are
       changed. For  example,  if  only  one  of  many  requested
       attributes  is  invalid  or  not  supported,  an  error is
       returned, and none of the attributes are updated.

       For a full list of the supported registered memory  region
       attributes, refer to the manual page.

       The  handle  of  the NIC where the memory region is regis-
       tered.  The base address of the memory region.  The handle

       The operation completed successfully.  The  memory  handle
       or  address  was  invalid.   The  specified protection tag
       attribute was invalid.  The specified attributes requested
       support  for  Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) Read, but
       the VI provider does not support it.  The operation failed
       due to insufficient resources.
