       The uuto command sends source_files to destination.

       The uupick command accepts or rejects files transmitted to
       the user.

       uuto  uses the facility to send files, while it allows the
       local system to control the file access.   A  source_files
       name  is  a pathname on your machine.  destination has the
       form: system[!system]...!user where system is taken from a
       list  of system names that uucp knows about (see uuname in
       user is the login name of a user on the specified  system.

       The  following options are available: Copy the source file
       into the spool directory before transmission.   Send  mail
       to the sender when the copy is complete.  If a file exists
       in the target directory with the same  name  as  the  file
       being  transferred,  do  not  overwrite the existing file.
       Instead, try to create a new file.  If the file  is  named
       file, create file.N where N is a one- or two-digit number.
       The numbers appended to the filename will  begin  with  00
       and  will  increase  by  1 for each subsequent file of the
       same name to a maximum of 99.  If another version  of  the
       file cannot be created, the user is notified by mail.

       If  the length of the filename is equal to the maximum for
       the system, no new version is created.  If the  length  of
       the  filename  is less than the maximum for the system but
       the filename and the suffix are greater than the  maximum,
       the suffix will be truncated.  Therefore, it is still pos-
       sible for files whose names  are  one  or  two  characters
       shorter  than  the  system maximum to be overwritten.  The
       files (or subtrees, if directories are specified) are sent
       to  PUBDIR  on  system, where PUBDIR is a public directory
       defined in the uucp source.  By default, this directory is
       /var/spool/uucppublic.   Specifically,  the files are sent
       to   PUBDIR/receive/user/mysystem/files.    The   destined
       recipient is notified by of the arrival of files.

       Note  that  in  order to send files that begin with a dot,
       the files must be qualified with a dot.  For example,  the
       following  filenames  are correct: The following filenames
       are incorrect: *prof* ?profile

                                                                1

       uupick searches PUBDIR for files destined  for  the  user.
       For  each  entry  (file  or  directory) found, a prompt is
       printed on the standard output.  In the C locale,  it  is:
       from  system sysname: [file filename] [dir dirname] uupick
       then reads a line from the standard input to determine the
       disposition  of the file: Go on to next entry.  Delete the
       entry.  Move the entry to named directory dir.  If dir  is
       not  specified  as  a  complete pathname (in which HOME is
       legitimate), a destination relative to the current  direc-
       tory  is assumed.  If no destination is given, the default
       is the current directory.  Same as m except moving all the
       files  sent  from  system.  Print the content of the file.
       Stop.  Same as q.  Escape to the shell to execute command.
       Print  a command summary.  uupick invoked with the -s sys-
       tem option will only search PUBDIR  for  files  sent  from
       system.
