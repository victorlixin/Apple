       The  chkey  command  prompts for a password and uses it to
       encrypt a new user encryption key.  The encrypted  key  is
       stored in the database.

       The  -f  option indicates to chkey that if the given pass-
       word does not match  the  login  password,  it  should  be
       treated  as a warning, and not a fatal error.  This option
       can be used if the user believes that  their  password  on
       the local NIS server may be out of date (due to a recently
       changed password, and the possibility that the  new  pass-
       word has not been propagated through the system).
