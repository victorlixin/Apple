       The  ct command dials the telephone number of a modem that
       is attached to a terminal and spawns  a  process  to  that
       terminal.

       The ct command takes the following options: By default, ct
       hangs up the current line so it can be used to answer  the
       incoming call.  This option prevents this action.  It also
       waits for the termination  of  the  specified  ct  process
       before  returning  control  to  the user's terminal.  This
       option sets the data rate, where  speed  is  expressed  in
       baud  rates.   The default baud rate is 1200.  This option
       specifies verbose mode: ct sends a  running  narrative  to
       stderr.   If  there are no free lines ct asks if it should
       wait for one, and if so, for how many  minutes  it  should
       wait  before it gives up.  ct continues to try to open the
       dialers at one minute intervals until the specified  limit
       is  exceeded.  This dialogue may be overridden by specify-
       ing this option where maxmins is  the  maximum  number  of
       minutes  that  ct  is  to wait for a line.  This option is
       used for debugging; it produces a detailed output  of  the
       program  execution  on  standard error.  num is an integer
       between 0 and 9 inclusive,  where  9  indicates  the  most
       detailed debugging information.

       The  telno argument is a telephone number with equal signs
       (=) for secondary dial tones,  and  minus  signs  (-)  for
       delays at appropriate places.  The set of valid characters
       for telno is: the digits 0 through 9, -, =, * and #.   The
       maximum  length  of  telno is 31 characters.  If more than
       one telephone number is specified, ct tries each  in  suc-
       cession  until  one answers; this is useful for specifying
       alternate dialing paths.

       ct tries each line listed in the file until  it  finds  an
       available line with appropriate attributes, or runs out of
       entries.

       After the user on the destination terminal logs out, there
       are two things that could occur, depending on what type of
       port monitor is monitoring the port.

       If there is no port monitor, ct prompts  with  Reconnect?.
       If  the  response  begins  with  the letter n, the line is
       dropped; otherwise, is started again and the login: prompt
       is printed.

       If a port monitor is monitoring the port, the port monitor

                                                                1

ct(1bnu)                                                 ct(1bnu)

       reissues the login: prompt.

       The user should log out properly before disconnecting.

       The ct program will not  work  with  a  DATAKIT  Multiplex
       interface.

       For  a  shared  port  (one  used for both dial in and dial
       out), the ttymon program running on the line must have the
       -r and -b options specified.
