       The  uidadmin  command is used primarily by non-privileged
       users to display and update entries in the user ID mapping
       database.

   OOppttiioonnss
       The options to uidadmin have the following meanings: Spec-
       ify the name of the ID mapping scheme.   Specify  a  local
       name  (logname)  into which the remote name maps.  logname
       must be a valid logname on the local machine.  A non-priv-
       ileged  user  can map a remote name only to his or her own
       local logname; if the -l option  is  omitted,  the  user's
       local  logname  is assumed.  When a privileged user maps a
       remote name to a non-privileged user's local logname,  the
       -l  option is required.  Add a map entry.  The scheme name
       and the remote name must be specified.  A local name  dif-
       ferent from the user's logname can be specified by a priv-
       ileged user.  Specify the remote (global) name.  The  for-
       mat  of g_name is scheme-dependent; generally, it includes
       a logname and a machine name.  Delete a  map  entry.   The
       scheme  name and the local name must be specified.  Speci-
       fying the remote name is optional.  If only the local name
       is  specified,  all  entries mapping to the local name are
       deleted.  If a remote name is also specified, a particular
       map  entry  is  deleted.   Check  the consistency of a map
       file.  The -c option is  intended  for  use  by  a  system
       administrator.   The  scheme  name must be specified.  Map
       entries containing syntax errors and unknown lognames  are
       displayed.   Lognames  are unknown if they do not exist in
       /etc/passwd.  Fix an inconsistent map file.  The -f option
       is  intended  for  use by a system administrator.  Entries
       that are out of order are sorted; map  entries  containing
       syntax  errors and unknown lognames are displayed, and the
       system administrator is given the opportunity to change or
       delete them.

       The  user  ID database consists of one or more user ID map
       files, where each file  is  associated  with  a  different
       authentication scheme.

       Non-privileged  users  are  limited  to administering only
       primary attribute entries that map  into  their  own  user
       identities.  Mapping of secondary attributes is controlled
       exclusively   by   the    system    administrator.     The

                                                                1

       administrator  of user-controlled mapping must be in group
       sys.

       When no options are specified, uidadmin lists all  schemes
       and  for each scheme, indicates whether it is in SECURE or
       USER mode.  A scheme in USER mode has user-controlled map-
       ping enabled.  When scheme is specified, uidadmin uses the
       user's real  UID  to  determine  the  local  logname,  and
       reports  entries  in  that scheme's user map file that map
       into the local name.  When a privileged user  specifies  a
       scheme,  the entire contents of the scheme's user map file
       are displayed.

       When scheme  and  logname  are  specified  with  no  other
       options,  all entries in the scheme's uidata file that map
       into logname are reported.  Only a privileged user can use
       this form of the command to list other users' entries.

       Note  that  all update operations are logged (whether suc-
       cessful or not) in /var/adm/log/idmap.log.

       The following command adds an entry to the user  map  file
       associated with scheme ns.  The entry maps from the remote
       name  our_gang:alfalfa  into  the  user's  local  logname.
       uidadmin  -S  ns -a -r our_gang:alfalfa The following com-
       mands include the -d option.  The first line  deletes  the
       entry  that  maps  the  remote  name our_gang:alfalfa into
       local user darla.  The second line deletes from  the  user
       map  file  all entries that map into the local name darla.
       uidadmin -S ns -d -r our_gang:waldo -l darla
       uidadmin -S ns -d -l darla
