       rexec  is  the  REXEC  command  that  allows the user on a
       client machine to execute a service on a remote  host.   A
       user  on  a  client machine can utilize any service on the
       host, provided the user is authorized to access  the  ser-
       vice.

       Although  any  service  can  be installed, REXEC generally
       provides the following standard services: A remote command
       execution  service,  which  allows the user to execute any
       command (provided the user has appropriate permissions) on
       the  remote  host.   Any  arguments required by the remote
       command need to be specified on the rx  command  line.   A
       remote login service, which effectively logs the user into
       the remote host, bypassing the login/password sequence.  A
       service  that lets the user query a remote host for a list
       of services that the user  is  allowed  to  execute.   The
       arguments  to  the REXEC commands have the following mean-
       ings: The name of the remote host on which the service  is
       defined.   The  name  of the service to be executed on the
       remote host.   Service  arguments  (that  is,  options  or
       option  operands).   The  command to be executed remotely,
       including applicable arguments.

       When  the  REXEC  software  is  installed  on  the  client
       machine,  the  standard  services  are linked to the rexec
       command.  Once linked, the user can execute a  service  by
       specifying the service name, followed by the host name and
       the parameters to the service.

       The user on the client machine can pass environment  vari-
       ables to a service by setting the RXPORT variable.  RXPORT
       contains a comma-separated  list  of  exported  variables.
       Only exported variables from the user's environment can be
       passed to the specified service.  If RXPORT only  consists
       of the special character *, then all exported variables on
       the local system are passed to  the  remote  service.   By
       default, the remote service environment includes the vari-
       ables PATH and HOME.

                                                                1

       rexec requires  that  tirdwr  has  been  pushed  onto  the
       stream.   If  it  has  not, then rexec will exit and log a
       message in /usr/adm/log/rexec.log.  If it has then  execu-
       tion will continue.

       If  a user wants to see who is logged into the remote host
       strider, the following command can be used: rexec  strider
       rx  who If rexec is linked to rx, the user can execute the
       following: rx strider who If a user wants to  execute  the
       command  on the remote host aslan, passing the environment
       variables TERM and EXINIT to the server, the user can exe-
       cute the following: RXPORT=TERM,EXINIT rx aslan vi main.c
