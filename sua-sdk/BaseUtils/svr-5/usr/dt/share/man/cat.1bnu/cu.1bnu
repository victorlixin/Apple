       The  cu  command  calls up another  system, a terminal, or
       possibly a non- system.  It manages an interactive conver-
       sation with possible transfers of files.

       cu  takes  the  following  options.   The  -c,  -l, and -s
       options play a part in selecting the medium; the remaining
       options  are used in configuring the line.  Force the num-
       ber of bits processed on the line to be n, where n can  be
       either  7  or  8.   This allows connection between systems
       with different character sizes.  By default, the character
       size  of  the  line  is  set to the value specified by the
       CHARSIZE parameter in the Config file (see If no  CHARSIZE
       value  is specified in the Config file, the character size
       of the line is set to the same as the current local termi-
       nal.

       For  example,  if  no CHARSIZE value is specified, and you
       are using an 8-bit system  to  call  a  7-bit  system,  cu
       assumes  the system you want to call is another 8-bit sys-
       tem; unless otherwise specified with the -b 7  on  the  cu
       command line.

       If  CHARSIZE  is set to 7 in the Config file, and you want
       cu to call an 8-bit system, you would specify -b 8 on  the
       cu  command  line  to override both the CHARSIZE value and
       the local terminal setting.  Force cu to only use  entries
       in  the  file  having a value in the Type field that match
       type.  Typically, type specifies the name of a local  area
       network.   Enable  debugging.  This option logs diagnostic
       information for both the conversation phase and  the  con-
       nection  phase.   Output  is  sent to the terminal screen.
       Set an even data parity.  This option forces cu to  gener-
       ate  an even parity during data transmission.  By default,
       cu uses the value specified by the PARITY parameter in the
       Config  file  to establish the parity for data sent to the
       remote system (see By default, the PARITY parameter is set
       to  the local terminal setting.  Set communication mode to
       half-duplex.  This option  echoes  characters  locally  to
       support calls to other computer systems that expect termi-
       nals to be set to half-duplex mode.  Specify a device name
       to use as the communication line.  This option can be used
       to override the search that would otherwise take place for
       the first available line having the right speed.  When the
       -l option is used without the -s option, the speed of  the
       line  is  taken from the Devices file entry having a value
       in the Line field that matches the device name  line  (see
       When  the -l and -s options are used together, cu searches
       the Devices file to check if the requested speed  for  the
       requested line is available.  If available, the connection

                                                                1

       is made at the requested speed, otherwise, an  error  mes-
       sage  is printed and the call is not made.  In the general
       case where a specified  device  is  a  directly  connected
       asynchronous line (for example, /dev/term/ab), a telephone
       number is not required.  The specified device need not  be
       in the /dev directory.  If the specified device is associ-
       ated with an auto dialer, the  destination  argument  must
       specify a telephone number.  Request user prompt for tele-
       phone number.  For added security, this option will prompt
       the  user  to  provide  the telephone number to be dialed,
       rather than taking it from the command line.  Set  an  odd
       data  parity.   This  option  forces cu to generate an odd
       parity during data transmission.  By default, cu uses  the
       value specified by the PARITY parameter in the Config file
       to establish the parity for data sent to the remote system
       (see  By default, the PARITY parameter is set to the local
       terminal setting.  Set data parity to none.   This  option
       forces  cu to generate a none parity during data transmis-
       sion.  By default, cu uses the value specified by the PAR-
       ITY  parameter  in the Config file to establish the parity
       for data sent to the remote system (see  By  default,  the
       PARITY  parameter  is  set  to the local terminal setting.
       Specify the transmission speed (300, 1200, 2400,  4800  or
       9600).  The default value is Any, which will depend on the
       order of the lines in the file.  Most  modems  are  either
       2400bps  or  9600bps.  Directly connected lines may be set
       to speeds higher than 2400bps.  Set an appropriate mapping
       of  carriage-return  to  carriage-return-line-feed  pairs.
       This option is used to dial a terminal which has been  set
       to auto answer.  Use chat scripts. By default, cu does not
       use chat scripts.

       cu uses the same mechanism as uucp to establish a  connec-
       tion.    This   means  that  it  uses  the  control  files
       /etc/uucp/Devices (see  and  /etc/uucp/Systems  (see  This
       gives  cu  the  ability  to  choose from several different
       media to establish the  connection.   The  possible  media
       include  telephone  lines,  direct  connections, and local
       area networks (LANs).  The Devices file contains a list of
       media that are available on your system.  The Systems file
       contains information for connecting to remote systems, but
       is not generally readable.

       The destination argument lets cu know what system you wish
       to connect to.  destination can be blank, a telephone num-
       ber,  a  system  name, or a LAN-specific address.  A tele-
       phone number is a string consisting of the tone dial char-
       acters (the digits 0 through 9, *, and #) plus the special
       characters = and -.  The equal sign designates a secondary
       dial  tone and the minus sign creates a 4 second delay.  A
       system name is the name of  any  computer  that  uucp  can
       call;  the  uuname  command  (see  prints  a list of these
       names.  The documentation for your LAN will show the  form

                                                                2

cu(1bnu)                                                 cu(1bnu)

       of the LAN-specific address.

       If  cu's  default  behavior is invoked (that is, if you do
       not use the -c or -l  options),  cu  uses  destination  to
       determine  which medium to use.  If destination is a tele-
       phone number, then cu assumes that you want to use a tele-
       phone  line  and  it selects an automatic call unit (ACU).
       If destination is not a telephone number, then cu  assumes
       that  it  is  a system name.  In this case, cu follows the
       uucp calling mechanism and uses the  Systems  and  Devices
       files  to  obtain the best available connection.  Since cu
       chooses a speed that is appropriate for the medium that it
       selects, you may not use the -s option when destination is
       a system name.

       The -c and -l options modify this default behavior.  -c is
       most often used to select a LAN by specifying a Type field
       from the Devices file.  Here, destination is assumed to be
       a  system  name.  If the connection attempt to this system
       name fails, a connection will be attempted using  destina-
       tion  as a LAN-specific address.  The -l option is used to
       specify a device associated with a direct connection.   If
       the  connection is truly a direct connection to the remote
       machine, then there is no  need  to  specify  destination.
       This is the only case when a blank destination is allowed.
       On the other hand, there may be cases in which the  speci-
       fied  device connects to a dialer, so it is valid to spec-
       ify a telephone number as  destination.   The  -c  and  -l
       options  should  not  be specified together on the command
       line.

       After making the connection, cu runs as two processes: the
       transmit  process  reads data from the standard input and,
       except for lines beginning with a tilde (~),  passes  them
       to  the  remote  system;  the receive process accepts data
       from the remote system and,  except  for  lines  beginning
       with  a  tilde,  passes them to the standard output.  Nor-
       mally, an automatic DC3/DC1 protocol is  used  to  control
       input  from  the remote so that the buffer is not overrun.
       Lines beginning with a tilde have special meanings.

       The transmit process interprets the following  user-initi-
       ated  commands:  terminate  the  conversation.  Note that,
       until the connection is established, attempting to use  ~.
       to terminate the conversation will have no effect.  escape
       to an interactive shell on the local system.  run  cmd  on
       the  local  system  (via sh -c).  run cmd locally and send
       its output to the remote system.  run cmd locally and con-
       nect  its  input  and output to the remote system.  change
       the directory on the local system.  Note  that  ~!cd  will
       cause  the  command  to  be run by a sub-shell.  copy file
       from (on the remote system) to file to on the  local  sys-
       tem.   If to is omitted, the from argument is used in both

                                                                3

       places.  copy file from (on local system) to  file  to  on
       the remote system.  If to is omitted, the from argument is
       used in both places.  send the line ~line  to  the  remote
       system.   transmit a BREAK to the remote system (which can
       also be specified as ~%b).  toggle the -d debugging option
       on or off (which can also be specified as ~%d).  print the
       values of the termio structure variables  for  the  user's
       terminal  (useful for debugging).  print the values of the
       termio structure variables for  the  remote  communication
       line (useful for debugging).  toggle between DC3/DC1 input
       control protocol and no input  control.   This  is  useful
       when  the  remote  system does not respond properly to the
       DC3 and DC1 characters.  (this can also  be  specified  as
       ~%nostop).   toggle the output flow control setting.  When
       enabled, outgoing data  flow  may  be  controlled  by  the
       remote  host  (this  can  also be specified as ~%noostop).
       allow/disallow unsolicited diversions.   That  is,  diver-
       sions  not  specified by ~%take.  allow/disallow old style
       syntax for received diversions.  The receive process  nor-
       mally  copies  data from the remote system to the standard
       output of the local system.  It may also direct the output
       to local files.

       The use of ~%put requires and on the remote side.  It also
       requires that the current control characters on the remote
       system  be  identical to the current control characters on
       the local system.  Backslashes are inserted at appropriate
       places for these control characters.

       The  use  of  ~%take  requires the existence of and on the
       remote system.  Also, tabs mode (see should be set on  the
       remote  system  if tabs are to be copied without expansion
       to spaces.

       When cu is used on system sysX to connect to  system  sysY
       and  subsequently used on system sysY to connect to system
       sysZ, commands on system Y can be executed  by  using  ~~.
       Executing  a  tilde  command reminds the user of the local
       system uname.  For example, uname can be executed on sysZ,
       sysX,  and  sysY as follows: uname sysZ ~[sysX]!uname sysX
       ~~[sysY]!uname sysY In general, ~ causes the command to be
       executed  on  the original machine.  ~~ causes the command
       to be executed on the next machine in the chain.

       It is convenient to  think  of  cu  as  operating  in  two
       phases.   The first phase is the connection phase in which
       the connection is established.  cu then enters the conver-
       sation phase.

       The  cu  command sets the input and output conversion mode
       to on or off, as appropriate, to avoid a character conver-
       sion on the local system when accessing the remote system.

                                                                4

       On the remote system,  the  input  and  output  conversion
       should  be  set  manually, as cu cannot know whether input
       conversion is required or not.  In most cases, remote sys-
       tems  can  be used with input conversion switched on; how-
       ever, when transferring files, this should be switched off
       before  invoking  the  file  transfer  command in order to
       avoid unexpected conversion of the file contents.

       You cannot use cu to log in as root if root's login  shell

       The  cu command does not perform any integrity checking on
       data it transfers.  Data fields with special cu characters
       may  not be transmitted properly.  Depending on the inter-
       connection hardware, it may be necessary to use a  ~.   to
       terminate  the  conversion,  even if stty 0 has been used.
       Non-printing characters  are  not  dependably  transmitted
       using  either  the  ~%put or ~%take commands.  cu will not
       return a login prompt immediately  upon  connection,  when
       used  between  an  IMBR1  and  a PENRIL modem.  A carriage
       return will return the prompt.

       ~%put and ~%take  cannot  be  used  over  multiple  links.
       Files must be moved one link at a time.

       If  cu  is  invoked without the -b option from the command
       line in an Xterm  window,  then  problems  may  occur  and
       ~%take may fail.

       There  is an artificial slowing of transmission by cu dur-
       ing the ~%put operation so that loss of data is  unlikely.
       Files  transferred  using  ~%take  or ~%put must contain a
       trailing  newline,  otherwise  the  operation  will  hang.
       Entering d usually clears the hang condition.
