       The uustat command functions in the following three areas:
       displays the general status  of,  or  cancels,  previously
       specified  commands;  provides  remote  system performance
       information, in terms of average transfer rates or average
       queue  times;  provides general remote system-specific and
       user-specific status of uucp connections to other systems.

   OOppttiioonnss
       The  following  options  obtain  the general status of, or
       cancel previously specified  commands.   Note  that  these
       options  are  mutually exclusive.  List all jobs in queue.
       List the total number of jobs displayed.  This option  can
       only  be  used  in  conjunction with the -a or -s options.
       Kill the uucp request whose job identification  is  jobid.
       The  killed uucp request must belong to the person issuing
       the uustat command unless the user is  root  or  the  UUCP
       administrator.   If  the job is killed by root or the UUCP
       administrator, email is sent to the user.  Report the sta-
       tus  of  accessibility of all machines.  The machine names
       are listed in collated order.   (The  collation  order  is
       derived  from  LC_COLLATE,  see  LANG  on and Suppress all
       standard output, but not standard error.  This  option  is
       used  in  conjunction with the -k and -r options.  Execute
       the command ps -flp for all the process IDs  that  are  in
       the  lock  files.   List the jobs queued for each machine.
       If a status file exists for the machine,  the  date,  time
       and  status  information  are reported.  In addition, if a
       number appears in parentheses next to the number of C or X
       files, it is the age in days of the oldest C or X file for
       that system.  The Retry field  represents  the  number  of
       hours  until the next possible call.  The Count field con-
       tains the number of failure attempts.  Note that, for sys-
       tems  with  a  moderate  number  of outstanding jobs, this
       could take 30 seconds or more  of  real-time  to  execute.
       The machine names are listed in collated order.  (The col-
       lation order is derived from LC_COLLATE, see LANG on and

       Here is an example  of  the  output  produced  by  the  -q
       option:  eagle     3C   04/07-11:07   NO DEVICES AVAILABLE
       mh3bs3    2C   07/07-10:42    SUCCESSFUL  This  shows  how
       many command files are waiting for each system.  Each com-
       mand file may have zero or more files  to  be  sent  (zero
       means to call the system and query if work is to be done).

                                                                1

       The date and time refer to the previous  interaction  with
       the  system  followed  by  the  status of the interaction.
       Rejuvenate jobid.  The files  associated  with  jobid  are
       touched so that their modification time is set to the cur-
       rent time.  This prevents the cleanup daemon from deleting
       the  job  until  the  job's  modification time reaches the
       limit imposed by the daemon.  The following  options  pro-
       vide  remote  system  performance information, in terms of
       average transfer rates or average queue times.  Note  that
       the -c and -d options can only be used in conjunction with
       the -t option: Report the average transfer rate or average
       queue  time for the past 60 minutes for the remote system.

       The following two options can only be used in  conjunction
       with this option: number is specified in minutes.  Used to
       override the 60  minute  default  used  for  calculations.
       These  calculations  are based on information contained in
       the optional performance log  and  therefore  may  not  be
       available.   Calculations  can  only be made from the time
       that the performance log was  last  cleaned  up.   Average
       queue  time  is  calculated when -c is specified.  Average
       transfer rate is calculated when -c is not specified.  For
       example,  the  command: uustat -t eagle -d 50 -c produces:
       average queue time to eagle      for last  50  minutes:  5
       seconds  The  same  command  without  -c produces: average
       transfer rate with eagle      for last 50 minutes: 2000.88
       bytes/sec The following options provide the general remote
       system-specific and user-specific status of  uucp  connec-
       tions  to  other systems.  Either or both of the following
       options can be specified with uustat.  The -j  option  can
       only  be  used in conjunction with the -s or -a options to
       list the total number of jobs displayed.  Report the  sta-
       tus of all uucp requests for remote system system.  Report
       the status of all uucp requests issued  by  user.   Output
       for  both  the -s and -u options has the following format:
       eagleN1bd7  4/07-11:07  S  eagle  dan  522     /home/dan/A
       eagleC1bd8      4/07-11:07     S     eagle     dan      59
       D.3b2al2ce4924
                   4/07-11:07  S  eagle  dan   rmail   mike  With
       the  above  two  options, the first field is the job ID of
       the job.  This is followed by  the  date/time.   The  next
       field  contains an S if the job is sending a file, or an R
       if the job is requesting a file.  The next  field  is  the
       machine  to  which the file is to be transferred.  This is
       followed by the user ID of the user who  queued  the  job.
       The  next  field  contains the size of the file, or in the
       case of a remote execution (rmail is the command used  for
       remote  mail),  the  name  of  the command.  When the size
       appears in this field, the filename is also  given.   This
       can  either  be  the name given by the user or an internal
       name (for example, D.3b2alce4924) that is created for data
       files  associated  with  remote  executions (rmail in this
       example).  Report the job state: q for queued jobs, r  for
       running  jobs, i for interrupted jobs, and c for completed

                                                                2

       jobs.

       A job is queued if the transfer has not started.  A job is
       running when the transfer has begun.  A job is interrupted
       if the transfer began but was terminated before  the  file
       was completely transferred.  A completed job is a job that
       has successfully transferred.  The completed state  infor-
       mation  is  maintained  in  the  accounting  log, which is
       optional and may be unavailable.  The options can be  used
       in any combination, but at least one option must be speci-
       fied.  The -S option can also be used with the -s  and  -u
       options.   The  output  for  this option is similar to the
       output for -s and -u,  except  that  the  job  states  are
       appended  as the last output word.  Output for a completed
       job has the following format: eagleC1bd3 completed When no
       options  are  given, uustat outputs the status of all uucp
       requests issued by the current user.

       After the user has issued the uucp request, if the file to

       the spool directory with  the  -C  option  when  the  uucp
       request  was  made,  uustat reports a file size of -99999.
       The job will eventually fail because  the  file(s)  to  be
       transferred cannot be found.
