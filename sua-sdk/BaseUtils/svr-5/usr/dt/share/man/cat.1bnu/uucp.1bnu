       The  uucp  command  copies files named by the source_files
       arguments to the destination_file argument.

       The uulog command queries a log  file  of  uucp  or  uuxqt
       transactions  in  the file /var/uucp/.Log/uucico/system or
       /var/uucp/.Log/uuxqt/system.

       The uuname command lists the names  of  systems  known  to
       uucp.

       A source filename may be a pathname on your machine or may
       have the form: system_name!pathname where  system_name  is
       taken  from  a list of system names that uucp knows about.
       The destination system_name may also  include  a  list  of
       system  names  such  as:  system_name!system_name!...!sys-
       tem_name!pathname In this case, an attempt is made to send
       the  file,  via  the  specified route, to the destination.
       Care should be taken to ensure that intermediate nodes  in
       the  route  are willing to forward information.  The shell
       metacharacters ?, * and [...] appearing in  pathname  will
       be expanded on the appropriate system.

       These  utilities process supplementary code set characters
       according to the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environ-
       ment  variable  (see  LANG on except that system-dependent
       names (for example, user names) and grade given to the  -g
       option  (see below) must be specified in ASCII characters.
       When shell metacharacters are used, the target system must
       also be able to process supplementary code set characters.

       Pathnames may be one of: a full pathname a  pathname  pre-
       ceded by ~user where user is a login name on the specified
       system and is replaced by that user's  login  directory  a
       pathname  preceded  by  ~destination  where destination is
       appended to /var/spool/uucppublic; note that this destina-
       tion  will  be  treated as a filename unless more than one
       file is being transferred by this request or the  destina-
       tion is already a directory; to ensure that it is a direc-
       tory, follow the destination with a /; for example, ~/dan/
       as    the    destination    will    make   the   directory
       /var/spool/uucppublic/dan if it does not exist and put the
       requested  file(s) in that directory anything else is pre-
       fixed by  the  current  directory  If  the  result  is  an

                                                                1

       erroneous  pathname  for  the remote system, the copy will
       fail.  If destination_file is a directory, the  last  part
       of the source_files name is used.

       uucp  removes  execute permissions across the transmission
       and gives the following read, write, and ownership permis-
       sions (see with uucp files being transferred to a user who
       has a valid login on the destination system, the directory
       created  will have 0770 permissions, the file(s) will have
       0660 permissions, and they will be owned by  the  destina-
       tion user with uucp files being transferred to a non-exis-
       tent user (for example, due to a typographical  error)  on
       the  destination  system,  the directory created will have
       1777 permissions (sticky bit turned on)  and  the  file(s)
       will  have  0666  permissions,  and will be owned by uucp.
       The -m option will only work when sending files or receiv-
       ing  a single file.  Receiving multiple files specified by
       special shell characters ?, * and [...] will not  activate
       the -m option.

       The  forwarding  of files through other systems may not be
       compatible with the previous version of uucp.  If forward-
       ing is used, all systems in the route must have compatible
       versions of uucp.

       The uucp command takes the following options: Do not  copy
       local  file  to  the  spool  directory for transfer to the
       remote machine (default).  Force the copy of  local  files
       to  the  spool directory for transfer.  Make all necessary
       directories for the file  copy  (default).   Do  not  make
       intermediate  directories for the file copy.  grade can be
       either a single ASCII letter/number or a string  of  ASCII
       alphanumeric  characters  defining  a  service grade.  The
       command can determine whether it is appropriate to use the
       single  letter/number  or a string of alphanumeric charac-
       ters as a service grade.  The output from uuglist will  be
       a  list  of service grades that are available or a message
       that says to use a single letter/number as a grade of ser-
       vice.   Output  the  uucp job identification string on the
       standard output.  This job identification can be  used  by
       to  obtain  the status of, or to terminate a uucp job.  It
       is valid as long as the job remains queued  on  the  local
       system.   Send mail to the requester when the copy is com-
       pleted.  Notify user on the remote system that a file  was
       sent.  Do not start the file transfer, just queue the job.
       Report status of the transfer to file.  This option  over-
       rides  the -m option.  When the status file is created, it
       is assigned the owner and group attributes of  the  parent
       directory.   The parent directory where the status file is
       to be written must be publically writable to allow uucp to
       create  the  status file.  If file already exists, it must
       be publically writable, so that uucp can append the status
       information  to it.  If a file exists in the target direc-
       tory with the same name as the file being transferred,  do

                                                                2

uucp(1bnu)                                             uucp(1bnu)

       not overwrite the existing file.  Instead, try to create a
       new file.  If the file is named file, create file.N  where
       N is a two-digit number.  The number appended to the file-
       name will begin with 00 and will increase by  1  for  each
       subsequent  file  of the same name to a maximum of 99.  If
       another version of the file cannot be created, the user is
       notified by mail.

       If  the length of the filename is equal to the maximum for
       the system, no new version is created.  If the  length  of
       the  filename  is less than the maximum for the system but
       the filename and the suffix are greater than the  maximum,
       the  suffix  will  be truncated.  It is therefore possible
       for files whose names are one or  two  characters  shorter
       than the maximum system filename length to be overwritten.
       Produce debugging output on standard output.   debug_level
       is  an  integer between 0 and 9 inclusive; as it increases
       to 9, more detailed debugging information is given.   This
       option may not be available on all systems.

   UUuulloogg
       The  uulog command takes the following options: Print log-
       ging information about file transfer work involving system
       system.   Performs  a tail -f of the file transfer log for
       system.  (You must hit  to exit this function.)   Look  in
       the uuxqt log file for the given system.  Indicates that a
       tail command of number lines should  be  executed.   uulog
       with  no  options prints all logging information for every
       system that has contacted your machine.

   UUuunnaammee
       The uuname command takes the following options: Return the
       names of systems known to cu.  The two lists are the same,
       unless your machine is  using  different  /etc/uucp/System
       files for cu and uucp (see Return the local system name.

       For  security  reasons,  the domain of remotely accessible
       files may be severely restricted.  You may not be able  to
       access  files  by  pathname.   You may also not be able to
       send files to arbitrary pathnames.   As  distributed,  the
       remotely  accessible  files  are  those  whose names begin
       /var/spool/uucppublic (equivalent to ~/).

       Protected files and files that are in  protected  directo-
       ries  that are owned by the requester can be sent by uucp.
       However, if the requester is root, and  the  directory  is
       not  searchable  by  other  or the file is not readable by
       other, the request will fail.

       When using uucp, it is currently not possible to configure
       the  character  size  and parity for the connection.  This
       information is hard-coded in  uucpio.   uucp  attempts  to
       establish a connection with a character size of 7 bits and

                                                                3

uucp(1bnu)                                             uucp(1bnu)

       even parity.  If the remote system is not using this  mode
       (or a compatible mode), the attempt to establish a connec-
       tion will fail.  If the connection  succeeds,  all  subse-
       quent data transfers will use full 8-bit characters.
