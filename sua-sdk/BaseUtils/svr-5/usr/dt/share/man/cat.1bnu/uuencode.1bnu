       The uuencode command converts a binary file into an ASCII-
       encoded representation that can be sent using

       The uudecode command reads encoded_file,  strips  off  any
       leading  and  trailing lines added by mailer programs, and
       recreates the original binary data with the filename, mode
       and owner specified in the header.

       uuencode encodes the contents of source_file, or the stan-
       dard input if  no  source_file  argument  is  given.   The
       file_label  argument  is  required:  it is included in the
       encoded file's header as the name of the file  into  which
       uudecode  is to place the binary (decoded) data.  uuencode
       also  includes  the  ownership  and  permission  modes  of
       source_file,  so  that the file specified by file_label is
       recreated with those same ownership and permission  modes.

       The encoded file is an ordinary ASCII text file; it can be
       edited by any text editor.  Only the mode or file label in
       the  header  should  be  changed,  to avoid corrupting the
       decoded binary.

       The encoded file's size is expanded by 35% (3 bytes become
       4, plus control information), causing it to take longer to
       transmit than the equivalent binary.

       The user on the remote system  who  is  invoking  uudecode
       (typically  uucp)  must  have write permission on the file
       specified in file_label.

       Since both uuencode and uudecode run with user ID  set  to
       uucp,  uudecode  can  fail  with  permission  denied  when
       attempted  in  a  directory  that  does  not  have   write
       permission allowed for other.

       The  following  command  line  reads  the  file in.cpio.Z,
       encodes its contents, adds a header  containing  the  file
       label  out.cpio.Z,  and  places  the  output  in  the file
       out.cpio.Z.uu:    uuencode    in.cpio.Z    out.cpio.Z    >
       out.cpio.Z.uu  The  following  command line reads the file
       out.cpio.Z.uu, decodes its contents, and places the output
       in the file out.cpio.Z: uudecode out.cpio.Z.uu
