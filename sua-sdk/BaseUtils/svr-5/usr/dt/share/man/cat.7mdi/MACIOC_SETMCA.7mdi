DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       This  ioctl  requests  that the MDI driver begin receiving
       frames sent to the requested MAC address  in  addition  to
       the default address, broadcast address and existing multi-
       cast addresses.   The  driver  will  continue  to  receive
       frames  on  this  MAC address until either a MACIOC_DELMCA
       ioctl request for this MAC address is received or the  MDI
       device is closed.

       The ioctl Data contains the MAC address to be added to the
       MDI driver's multicast address table.

       The ioctl data must be returned in the mp->b_cont  portion
       of  the  message  on  either success (M_IOCACK) or failure
       (M_IOCNACK); this portion of the message cannot  be  freed
       by the driver.

       The MDI driver should fail the ioctl if the MAC address is
       not a legal multicast address for that media type.  If the
       MAC  address  is already in the table, the MDI driver must
       return success, but should not  add  a  duplicate  of  the
       address to the multicast address table.
