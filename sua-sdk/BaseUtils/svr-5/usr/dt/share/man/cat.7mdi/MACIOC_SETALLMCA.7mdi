       This  ioctl  requests that the MDI driver begin delivering
       frames sent to all multicast MAC addresses in addition  to
       the  adapter's  MAC  address,  the  broadcast address, and
       existing multicast addresses.  The driver will continue to
       receive frames on all multicast MAC addresses until either
       a MACIOC_DELALLMCA ioctl request is received  or  the  MDI
       device is closed.

       The  MDI  driver  should fail this ioctl if the adapter is
       not capable of receiving all multicast addresses.  Do  not
       set  promiscuous  mode and filter out unicast addresses to
       support this ioctl.

       Acknowledgement  should  be  one  of  the  following:  Set
       ioc_rval  and  ioc_count  to zero.  Set ioc_count to zero,
       ioc_rval to -1, and ioc_error to  one  of  the  following:
       insufficient privilege Device does not use MAC addresses
