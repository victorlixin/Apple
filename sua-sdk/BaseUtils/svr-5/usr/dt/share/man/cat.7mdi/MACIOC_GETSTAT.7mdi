       This  ioctl requests that the MDI driver return media-spe-
       cific statistics  containing  information  about  the  MDI
       driver,  the  network adapter and the network itself.  MDI
       includes a statistics mechanism that  uses  media-specific
       statistics  structures:  Ethernet IEEE 802.5 token passing
       ring ANSI Fiber Distributed  Data  Interface  (FDDI)  ISDN
       (Integrated Services Digital Network)

       This replaces the mechanism based on the structure to pro-
       vide information to the command.

       The ioctl data contains space into which  the  MDI  driver
       should copy its statistics structure.

       The  MDI  driver  should fill the ioctl data area with the
       its statistics structure.
