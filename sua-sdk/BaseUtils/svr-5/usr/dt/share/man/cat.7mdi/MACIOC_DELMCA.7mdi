DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       This  ioctl  requests  that the MDI driver stops receiving
       frames sent to a MAC address.

   PPaarraammeetteerrss
       The ioctl data contains the MAC address to be deleted from
       the MDI driver's multicast address table.

   DDaattaa rreettuurrnneedd
       The  ioctl data must be returned in the mp->b_cont portion
       of the message on either  success  (M_IOCACK)  or  failure
       (M_IOCNACK);  this  portion of the message cannot be freed
       by the driver.

       The MDI driver should fail this ioctl if the  MAC  address
       to be deleted is not in the multicast address table.
