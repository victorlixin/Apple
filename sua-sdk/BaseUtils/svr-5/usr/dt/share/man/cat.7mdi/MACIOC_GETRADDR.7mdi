DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       This  ioctl requests that the MDI driver retrieve the fac-
       tory MAC address from the controller.  This will appear as
       an message with an associated block.

       Drivers for MDI devices that do not use MAC addresses must
       use this primitive so that  upper-layer  calls  will  fail
       gracefully.

       The  ioctl  data  contains space into which the MDI driver
       should copy its MAC address.

       The MDI driver should fill the ioctl data  area  with  its
       MAC  address.   This  address  is  the  current in-use MAC
       address.  The data is one of  the  following:  Acknowledge
       successful  completion of the operation.  Set ioc_rval set
       to zero and ioc_count set to the size of the  MAC  address
       in the associated block.  Acknowledge unsuccessful comple-
       tion of the operation.  Set ioc_count to zero, ioc_rval to
       -1, and ioc_error set to EINVAL if the device does not use
       MAC addresses.  For other error conditions, set  ioc_error
       to an appropriate value from
