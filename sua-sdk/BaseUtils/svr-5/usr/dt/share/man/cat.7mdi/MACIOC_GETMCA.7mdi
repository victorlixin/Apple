       This ioctl requests that the MDI driver return current set
       of active multicast addresses.

   PPaarraammeetteerrss
       The data contains space into which the MDI  driver  should
       copy  its multicast address table.  The MAC user will usu-
       ally issue a ioctl before this to determine  the  size  of
       the buffer to send down.

       The  MDI  driver  should fill the ioctl data area with its
       multicast address  table.   If  the  ioctl  data  area  is
       smaller than is needed, the MDI driver should copy as many
       entries as possible from its table.   If  the  ioctl  data
       area  is larger than is needed, the MDI driver should copy
       its entire table, and  adjust  the  b_wptr  and  ioc_count
       fields  to  match  the  size  of the data written into the
       ioctl data.
