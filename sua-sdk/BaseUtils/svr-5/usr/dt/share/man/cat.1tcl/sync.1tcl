       If  fileId  is  not specified, or if it is and this system
       does not support the fsync system call, this issues a sync
       system  call  to flush all pending disk output.  If fileId
       is specified and the system does support the fsync  system
       call,  it issues an fsync on the file corresponding to the
       specified Tcl fileId to force all pending output  to  that
       file out to the disk.

       If  fileId  is  specified,  the  file must be writable.  A
       flush is issued against the fileId before the sync.

       The infox have_fsync command can be used to  determine  if
       sync fileId will do a sync or an fsync.
