       server_open [option] host service

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Opens  a TCP/IP connection to a server of host on the port
       specified by service.  The server is then  accessed  using
       the  standard  Tcl  file I/O commands.  host may be a host
       name or an IP address.  port may be a  port  number  of  a
       service  name.   option  is  one of -buf or -nobuf.  If no
       options are specified, -buf is the default.

       If -buf is specified, then the file is buffered.  In  this
       case,  a pair of Tcl file ids are returned in a list.  The
       first id is open for read access, the  second  for  write.
       When  writing  to the file, the flush command must be used
       to force data in the buffer to be sent to the server.  The
       close  command  must  be called against both file ids when
       through with the socket.  Buffered access will  result  in
       significantly  better  performance  when  reading data and
       will also improve a series of writes  being  done  without
       intermixed  reads.   The fcntl command may be used to make
       one of these files unbuffered.

       If -nobuf is specified, then the file is unbuffered and  a
       single  file  id,  open  for  both reading and writing, is
       returned.

       If a host name is supplied and more than  one  address  is
       valid  for  the  host, the addresses are tried iteratively
       until a connection is established.  Use to obtain the list
       of valid addresses.
