       This procedure reads the file  fileName  and  returns  the
       contents  as  a  string.  If -nonewline is specified, then
       the last character of the file is discarded  if  it  is  a
       newline.  The second form specifies exactly how many bytes
       will be read and returned, unless  there  are  fewer  than
       numBytes  bytes  left  in  the file; in this case, all the
       remaining bytes are returned.

                                                                1
