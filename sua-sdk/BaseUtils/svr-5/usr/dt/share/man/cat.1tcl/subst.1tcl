       This command performs variable substitutions, command sub-
       stitutions,  and  backslash  substitutions  on  its string
       argument and returns the  fully-substituted  result.   The
       substitutions are performed in exactly the same way as for
       Tcl commands.  As a result, the string argument  is  actu-
       ally  substituted  twice,  once  by  the Tcl parser in the
       usual fashion for Tcl commands, and  again  by  the  subst
       command.

       If any of the -nobackslashes, -nocommands, or -novariables
       are specified, then the  corresponding  substitutions  are
       not  performed.  For example, if -nocommands is specified,
       no command substitution  is  performed:   open  and  close
       brackets  are  treated as ordinary characters with no spe-
       cial interpretation.  When it performs its  substitutions,
       subst does not give any special treatment to double quotes
       or curly braces.  For example: set a 44 subst  {xyz  {$a}}
       returns xyz {44}, not xyz {$a}.

                                                                1
