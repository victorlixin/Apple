       nice [priorityincr]

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Changes  or returns the process priority.  If priorityincr
       is omitted, the current priority is returned.  If  priori-
       tyincr  is  positive,  it is added to the current priority
       level, up to a system defined maximum (normally 19).

       Negative priorityincr  values  cumulatively  increase  the
       program's  priority down to a system defined minimum (nor-
       mally -19); increasing  priority  with  negative  niceness
       values will only work for the superuser.

       The new priority is returned.
