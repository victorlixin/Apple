       This  command  performs one of several operations that may
       obtain or manipulate strings or values that represent some
       notion  of  time.   The  option  argument  determines what
       action is carried out by the command.  The  legal  options
       (which  may  be abbreviated) are: Return a high-resolution
       time value as a system-dependent integer value.  The  unit
       of the value is system-dependent but should be the highest
       resolution clock available on the system  such  as  a  CPU
       cycle counter. This value should only be used for the rel-
       ative measurement of elapsed time.   Converts  an  integer
       time  value,  typically  returned  by clock seconds, clock
       scan, or the atime, mtime, or ctime options  of  the  file
       command,  to human-readable form.  If the -format argument
       is present the next argument is a  string  that  describes
       how the date and time are to be formatted.  Field descrip-
       tors consist of a % followed by a field descriptor charac-
       ter.   All  other  characters  are copied into the result.
       Valid field descriptors are: inserts a % abbreviated week-
       day  name  (Mon,  Tue,  etc.)   full weekday name (Monday,
       Tuesday, etc.)  abbreviated month name  (Jan,  Feb,  etc.)
       full month name locale-specific date and time day of month
       (01 - 31) hour in 24-hour format (00 - 23) hour in 12-hour
       format  (00 - 12) day of year (001 - 366) month number (01
       - 12) minute (00 - 59) AM/PM indicator seconds (00  -  59)
       week  of  year  (01  - 52), Sunday is the first day of the
       week weekday number (Sunday = 0) week of year (01  -  52),
       Monday  is  the first day of the week locale-specific date
       format locale-specific time format  year  without  century
       (00 - 99) year with century (e.g. 1990) time zone name

       In  addition,  the following field descriptors may be sup-
       ported on some systems (for example,   but  not  Windows):
       date  as  %m/%d/%y day of month (1 - 31), no leading zeros
       abbreviated month name inserts a newline time as  %I:%M:%S
       %p time as %H:%M inserts a tab time as %H:%M:%S

       If  the  -format  argument  is  not  specified, the format
       string "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y" is  used.   If  the  -gmt
       argument  is  present  the next argument must be a boolean
       which if true specifies that the time will be formatted as
       Greenwich Mean Time. If false then the local timezone will
       be used as defined by the operating environment.   Convert
       dateString  to an integer clock value (see clock seconds).
       This command can parse and convert virtually any  standard
       date  and/or  time string, which can include standard time
       zone mnemonics.  If only a time is specified, the  current
       date  is  assumed.   If the string does not contain a time
       zone mnemonic, the local time zone is assumed, unless  the
       -gmt  argument  is  true, in which case the clock value is
       calculated assuming that the specified time is relative to

                                                                1

       Greenwich Mean Time.

       If  the  -base flag is specified, the next argument should
       contain an integer clock value.  Only  the  date  in  this
       value is used, not the time.  This is useful for determin-
       ing the time on a specific day or doing  other  date-rela-
       tive conversions.

       The  dateString consists of zero or more specifications of
       the following form: A time of day, which is of  the  form:
       hh[:mm[:ss]]  [meridian] [zone] or hhmm [meridian] [zone].
       If no meridian  is  specified,  hh  is  interpreted  on  a
       24-hour  clock.   A  specific  month and day with optional
       year.  The acceptable formats  are  mm/dd[/yy],  monthname
       dd[, yy], dd monthname [yy] and day, dd monthname yy.  The
       default year is the current year.  If  the  year  is  less
       then 100, then 1900 is added to it.  A specification rela-
       tive to the current  time.   The  format  is  number  unit
       acceptable  units  are  year, fortnight, month, week, day,
       hour, minute (or min), and second (or sec).  The unit  can
       be  specified  as  a  singular  or  plural, as in 3 weeks.
       These modifiers may also be specified:  tomorrow,  yester-
       day, today, now, last, this, next, ago.

       The  actual  date is calculated according to the following
       steps.  First, any absolute date and/or time is  processed
       and  converted.   Using that time as the base, day-of-week
       specifications are added.  Next,  relative  specifications
       are  used.  If a date or day is specified, and no absolute
       or relative time is given, midnight is used.   Finally,  a
       correction  is applied so that the correct hour of the day
       is produced after allowing for daylight savings time  dif-
       ferences.   Return  the current date and time as a system-
       dependent integer value.  The unit of the  value  is  sec-
       onds,  allowing  it  to be used for relative time calcula-
       tions.  The value is usually defined as total elapsed time
       from  an ``epoch''.  Do not assume the value of the epoch.
