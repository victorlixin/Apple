       Creates  a  pipe.   If  fileId_var_r  and fileId_var_r are
       specified,  then  pipe  will  set   the   variable   named
       fileId_var_r to contain the fileId of the side of the pipe
       that was opened for reading, and set fileId_var_w to  con-
       tain  the  fileId  of the side of the pipe that was opened
       for writing.

       If the fileId variables are not  specified,  then  a  list
       containing  the  read and write fileIds is returned as the
       result of the command.

                                                                1
