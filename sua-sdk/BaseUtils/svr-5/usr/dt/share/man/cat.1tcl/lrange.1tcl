       lrange list first last

       list must be a valid Tcl list.  This command returns a new
       list consisting of elements first through last, inclusive.
       first  or  last  may be end (or any abbreviation of it) to
       refer to the last element of the list.  If first  is  less
       than  zero,  it is treated as if it were zero.  If last is
       greater than or equal to the number  of  elements  in  the
       list,  then  it is treated as if it were end.  If first is
       greater than last then an empty string is returned.

       NOTE: lrange list first first does not always produce  the
       same  result  as lindex list first (although it often does
       for simple fields that are not  enclosed  in  braces);  it
       does,  however,  produce  exactly the same results as list
       [lindex list first].
