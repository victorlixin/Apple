       Duplicates  an  open  file.   A new file ID is opened that
       addresses the same file as fileId.

       If targetFileId is specified, then the file is dup to this
       specified  file  ID.   Normally  this is stdin, stdout, or
       stderr.  The dup command will handle flushing  output  and
       closing  this  file.  The target file should be open if it
       is one of stdin, stdout, or stderr and the process is  not
       going to do an execl.  Otherwise internal C code that uses
       one of these files via direct access to stdio FILE  struct
       may behave strangely or fail.
