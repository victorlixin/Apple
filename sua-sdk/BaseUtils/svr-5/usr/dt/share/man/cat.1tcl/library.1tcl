       Tcl  includes  a  library  of Tcl procedures for commonly-
       needed functions.   The  procedures  defined  in  the  Tcl
       library  are generic ones suitable for use by many differ-
       ent applications.  The location  of  the  Tcl  library  is
       returned  by the info library command.  In addition to the
       Tcl library, each application will normally have  its  own
       library  of  support  procedures as well;  the location of
       this library  is  normally  given  by  the  value  of  the
       $app_library global variable, where app is the name of the
       application.  For example, the location of the Tk  library
       is kept in the variable $tk_library.

       To  access  the procedures in the Tcl library, an applica-
       tion should source the file init.tcl in the  library,  for
       example    with    the    Tcl    command    source   [info
       library]/init.tcl This will define the  unknown  procedure
       and  arrange  for  the  other  procedures to be loaded on-
       demand using the auto-load mechanism defined below.

       The following procedures are provided in the Tcl  library:
       Determines whether there is an executable file by the name
       cmd.  This command examines the directories in the current
       search  path  (given  by the PATH environment variable) to
       see if there is an executable file named  cmd  in  any  of
       those  directories.   If  so,  it  returns  1;   if not it
       returns 0.  auto_exec remembers information about previous
       searches  in  an  array named auto_execs;  this avoids the
       path search in future calls for the same cmd.  The command
       auto_reset  may be used to force auto_execok to forget its
       cached information.  This command  attempts  to  load  the
       definition  for  a  Tcl command named cmd.  To do this, it
       searches an auto-load path, which is a list of one or more
       directories.   The  auto-load  path is given by the global
       variable  $auto_path  if  it  exists.   If  there  is   no
       $auto_path variable, then the TCLLIBPATH environment vari-
       able is used, if it exists.  Otherwise the auto-load  path
       consists  of  just the Tcl library directory.  Within each
       directory in the auto-load  path  there  must  be  a  file
       tclIndex  that  describes  one or more commands defined in
       that directory and a script to evaluate which  loads  each
       of  the  commands.   The tclIndex file should be generated
       with the auto_mkindex command.  If  cmd  is  found  in  an
       index  file,  then  the appropriate script is evaluated to
       create the command.  The auto_load command  returns  1  if

                                                                1

       cmd  was  successfully  created.  The command returns 0 if
       there was no index entry for cmd or if the  script  didn't
       actually  define cmd (because, for example, index informa-
       tion is out of date).  If an error occurs while processing
       the  script,  then that error is returned.  auto_load only
       reads the index information once and saves it in the array
       auto_index;   future  calls  to auto_load check for cmd in
       the array rather than re-reading  the  index  files.   The
       cached  index  information may be deleted with the command
       auto_reset.  This will force the next auto_load command to
       reload  the  index database from disk.  Generates an index
       suitable for use by auto_load.  The command  searches  dir
       for  all  files whose names match any of the pattern argu-
       ments (matching is done with the glob command),  generates
       an  index of all the Tcl command procedures defined in all
       the matching files, and stores the index information in  a
       file  named  tclIndex  in  dir.   For example, the command
       auto_mkindex foo *.tcl will read all  the  .tcl  files  in
       subdirectory  foo and generate a new index file foo/tclIn-
       dex.

       auto_mkindex parses the Tcl scripts in a relatively  unso-
       phisticated  way:   if  any line contains the word proc as
       its first characters then it is assumed to be a  procedure
       definition  and  the next word of the line is taken as the
       procedure's name.  Procedure definitions that don't appear
       in  this way (if, for example, they have spaces before the
       proc) will not be indexed.  Destroys all  the  information
       cached  by  auto_execok  and  auto_load.  This information
       will be re-read from disk the  next  time  it  is  needed.
       auto_reset also deletes any procedures listed in the auto-
       load index, so that fresh copies of them  will  be  loaded
       the  next time that they're used.  Prints on standard out-
       put the names and values of all the elements in the  array
       arrayName.   arrayName  must be an array accessible to the
       caller of parray.  It may be either local or global.  This
       procedure  is invoked automatically by the Tcl interpreter
       whenever the name of a command doesn't exist.  The unknown
       procedure receives as its arguments the name and arguments
       of the missing command.  unknown first calls auto_load  to
       load  the command.  If this succeeds, then it executes the
       original command with  its  original  arguments.   If  the
       auto-load  fails  then unknown calls auto_execok to see if
       there is an executable file by the name cmd.   If  so,  it
       invokes  the Tcl exec command with cmd and all the args as
       arguments.  If cmd can't be auto-executed, unknown  checks
       to see if the command was invoked at top-level and outside
       of any script.  If so, then unknown takes takes two  addi-
       tional steps.  Firstly, it sees if cmd has one of the fol-
       lowing three forms:  !!, !event, or ^old^new?^?.   If  so,
       then  unknown carries out history substitution in the same
       way that would for these  constructs.   Secondly,  unknown
       checks  to  see  if  cmd  is  a unique abbreviation for an
       existing Tcl command.  If so, it expands the command  name

                                                                2

       and  executes the command with the original arguments.  If
       neither of the above efforts has been able to execute  the
       command, unknown generates an error return.  If the global
       variable auto_noload is defined, then the  auto-load  step
       is skipped.  If the global variable auto_noexec is defined
       then the auto-exec step is skipped.  Under normal  circum-
       stances  the return value from unknown is the return value
       from the command that was eventually executed.

       The following global variables are defined or used by  the
       procedures  in  the  Tcl  library:  Used by auto_execok to
       record information about whether particular commands exist
       as  executable files.  Used by auto_load to save the index
       information read from disk.  If set  to  any  value,  then
       unknown  will  not  attempt to auto-exec any commands.  If
       set to any value, then unknown will not attempt  to  auto-
       load  any  commands.  If set, then it must contain a valid
       Tcl list giving directories  to  search  during  auto-load
       operations.  If set, then it specifies the location of the
       directory containing library scripts (the  value  of  this
       variable  will  be  returned by the command info library).
       If this variable isn't set then a default value  is  used.
       If  set,  then  it  must  contain  a valid Tcl list giving
       directories to search during auto-load  operations.   This
       variable  is  only used if auto_path is not defined.  This
       variable is set by unknown to indicate that it is  active.
       It  is  used  to  detect  errors where unknown recurses on
       itself infinitely.  The variable is unset  before  unknown
       returns.
