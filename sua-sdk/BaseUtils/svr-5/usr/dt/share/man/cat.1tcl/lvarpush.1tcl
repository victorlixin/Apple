       The lvarpush command pushes (inserts) string as an element
       in the list contained in the variable var.  The element is
       inserted  before  position indexExpr in the list. If index
       is omitted, then 0 is assumed.  If var does not exist,  it
       is created.

       If  the  expression  indexExpr starts with the string end,
       then end is replaced with the index of the last element in
       the  list.   With  end,  the string is inserted before the
       last element. If the expression starts with len, then  len
       is replaced with the length of the list.

                                                                1
