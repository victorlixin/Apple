       This  procedure  performs a foreach-style loop over recur-
       sively matched files.   All  directories  in  dirlist  are
       recursively  searched (breadth-first), comparing each file
       found against the file glob  patterns  in  globlist.   For
       each  matched  file,  the  variable var is set to the file
       path and code is evaluated.  Symbolic links are  not  fol-
       lowed.

                                                                1
