       Returns  a range of characters from string starting at the
       character indexed by the expression firstExpr (zero-based)
       up to the character indexed by the expression lastExpr.

       If  the  expression  firstExpr or lastExpr starts with the
       string end, then end is replaced with  the  index  of  the
       last  character  in  the string.  If the expression starts
       with len, then len is replaced  with  the  length  of  the
       string.
