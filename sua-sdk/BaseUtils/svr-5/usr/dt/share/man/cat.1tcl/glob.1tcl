       This  command performs file name ``globbing'' in a fashion
       similar to the csh shell.  It returns a list of the  files
       whose names match any of the pattern arguments.

       If  the  initial  arguments to glob start with - then they
       are treated as switches.  The following switches are  cur-
       rently  supported:  Allows  an  empty  list to be returned
       without error;  without this switch an error  is  returned
       if  the  result  list  would  be  empty.  Marks the end of
       switches.  The argument following this one will be treated
       as  a  pattern  even  if  it starts with a -.  The pattern
       arguments may contain any of the following special charac-
       ters:  Matches any single character.  Matches any sequence
       of zero or more characters.  Matches any single  character
       in  chars.   If  chars contains a sequence of the form a-b
       then any character between a and b (inclusive) will match.
       Matches the character x.  Matches any of the strings a, b,
       etc.  As with a . at the beginning of  a  file's  name  or
       just  after  a  /  must be matched explicitly or with a {}
       construct.  In addition, all / characters must be  matched
       explicitly.

       If the first character in a pattern is ~ then it refers to
       the home directory for the user whose name follows the  ~.
       If  the  ~  is followed immediately by / then the value of
       the HOME environment variable is used.

       The glob command differs from csh globbing  in  two  ways.
       Firstly,  it  does not sort its result list (use the lsort
       command if you want the list sorted).  Secondly, glob only
       returns the names of files that actually exist;  in csh no
       check for existence is made unless a pattern contains a ?,
       *, or [] construct.
