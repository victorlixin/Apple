       Intersects  two  lists,  returning a list containing three
       lists:  the first list returned  is  everything  in  lista
       that  was  not  in  listb.   The  second list contains the
       intersection of the two lists, and the third list contains
       all the elements that were in listb but were not in lista.
       The returned lists will be sorted.
