       The  proc  command creates a new Tcl procedure named name,
       replacing any existing command or procedure of that  name.
       Whenever  the new command is invoked, the contents of body
       are executed by the Tcl interpreter.  args  specifies  the
       formal arguments to the procedure.  It consists of a list,
       possibly empty, each of whose elements specifies one argu-
       ment.   Each argument specifier is also a list with either
       one or two fields.  If there is only a single field in the
       specifier  then  it  is the name of the argument; if there
       are two fields, then the first is the  argument  name  and
       the second is its default value.

       When name is invoked, a local variable is created for each
       of the formal arguments to the procedure; its value is the
       value  of  the corresponding argument in the invoking com-
       mand or the  argument's  default  value.   Arguments  with
       default  values need not be specified in a procedure invo-
       cation.  However, there must be  enough  actual  arguments
       for  all  the  formal arguments that do not have defaults,
       and there must not be any extra actual  arguments.   There
       is  one  special  case  to permit procedures with variable
       numbers of arguments.  If the last formal argument has the
       name  args,  then a call to the procedure may contain more
       actual arguments than the procedure has formals.  In  this
       case, all of the actual arguments starting at the one that
       would be assigned to args are combined into a list (as  if
       the  list  command  had been used); this combined value is
       assigned to the local variable args.

       When body is being executed, variable names normally refer
       to  local  variables, which are created automatically when
       referenced and deleted when the  procedure  returns.   One
       local  variable  is  automatically created for each of the
       procedure's  arguments.   Global  variables  can  only  be
       accessed  by invoking the global command or the upvar com-
       mand.

       The proc command returns an empty string.  When  a  proce-
       dure is invoked, the procedure's return value is the value
       specified in a return command.  If the  procedure  doesn't
       execute  an  explicit return, then its return value is the
       value of the last  command  executed  in  the  procedure's
       body.   If  an  error occurs while executing the procedure
       body, then the procedure as a whole will return that  same
       error.

                                                                1
