       lsearch [mode] list pattern

       This  command  searches the elements of list to see if one
       of them matches pattern.  If so, the command  returns  the
       index  of the first matching element.  If not, the command
       returns -1.  The mode argument indicates how the  elements
       of  the  list  are  to be matched against pattern; it must
       have one of the following values: The  list  element  must
       contain  exactly the same string as pattern.  pattern is a
       glob-style pattern which is matched against each list ele-
       ment  using  the  same  rules as the string match command.
       pattern is treated as a  regular  expression  and  matched
       against each list element using the same rules as the reg-
       exp command.  If mode  is  omitted  then  it  defaults  to
       -glob.
