       lassign list var [var ...]

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Assigns  successive  elements of a list to specified vari-
       ables.  If there are more variable names than fields,  the
       remaining variables are set to the empty string.  If there
       are more elements than variables, a list of the unassigned
       elements is returned.

       For  example,  lassign  {dave 100 200 {Dave Foo}} name uid
       gid longName assigns name to ``dave'', uid to ``100'', gid
       to ``200'', and longName to ``Dave Foo''.
