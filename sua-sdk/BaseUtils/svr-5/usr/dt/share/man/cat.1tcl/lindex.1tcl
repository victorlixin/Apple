       This  command  treats  list  as a Tcl list and returns the
       element which is index elements from the beginning of  the
       list (for example, 0 refers to the first element, 1 to the
       second, and so on).  In  extracting  the  element,  lindex
       observes  the  same  rules  concerning braces, quotes, and
       backslashes as the Tcl command interpreter; however, vari-
       able  substitution  and command substitution do not occur.
       If index is negative, greater than or equal to the  number
       of  elements  in  value, then an empty string is returned.
       If index has the value end, it refers to the last  element
       in the list.
