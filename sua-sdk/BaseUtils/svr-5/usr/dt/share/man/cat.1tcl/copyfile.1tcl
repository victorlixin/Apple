       copyfile [-bytes num|-maxbytes num] fromFileId toFileId

       Copies  the  rest  of  the  file  specified by fromFileId,
       starting from its current position, to the file  specified
       by toFileId, starting from its current position.

       If  -bytes  is  specified,  then num bytes are copied.  If
       less than num bytes are available, an error  is  returned.
       If  -maxbytes  is specified, then num bytes are copied but
       no error is returned if less are available.

       The command returns the number of bytes that were  copied.

       The -bytes option is particularly useful for mixing binary
       data in with ASCII commands or data in a data stream.
