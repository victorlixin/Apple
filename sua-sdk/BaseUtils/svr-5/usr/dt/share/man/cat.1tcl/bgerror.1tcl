       The bgerror command doesn't exist as built-in part of Tcl.
       Instead, individual applications or  users  can  define  a
       bgerror  command (e.g. as a Tcl procedure) if they wish to
       handle background errors.

       A background error is one that occurs in an event  handler
       or  some  other  command  that  didn't  originate with the
       application.  For example, if an error occurs  while  exe-
       cuting  a command specified with the command, then it is a
       background error.  For a non-background error,  the  error
       can simply be returned up through nested Tcl command eval-
       uations until it reaches the top-level code in the  appli-
       cation; then the application can report the error in what-
       ever way it wishes.  When a background error  occurs,  the
       unwinding  ends in the Tcl library and there is no obvious
       way for Tcl to report the error.

       When Tcl detects a background error, it saves  information
       about  the  error and invokes the bgerror command later as
       an idle  event  handler.   Before  invoking  bgerror,  Tcl
       restores  the  errorInfo  and errorCode variables to their
       values at the time the error  occurred,  then  it  invokes
       bgerror  with the error message as its only argument.  Tcl
       assumes that the application has implemented  the  bgerror
       command,  and  that the command will report the error in a
       way that makes sense for the application.  Tcl will ignore
       any  result  returned by the bgerror command as long as no
       error is generated.

       If another Tcl error occurs  within  the  bgerror  command
       (for example, because no bgerror command has been defined)
       then Tcl reports the error itself by writing a message  to
       stderr.

       If  several background errors accumulate before bgerror is
       invoked to process them, bgerror will be invoked once  for
       each error, in the order they occurred.  However, if bger-
       ror returns with a break  exception,  then  any  remaining
       errors are skipped without calling bgerror.

       Tcl  has  no default implementation for bgerror.  However,
       in applications using Tk there will be a  default  bgerror
       containing  the error message and offers the user a chance
       to see a stack trace showing where the error occurred.

                                                                1
