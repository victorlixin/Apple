       This  command removes one or more variables.  Each name is
       a variable name, specified in any of the  ways  acceptable
       to  the set command.  If a name refers to an element of an
       array then that element is removed without  affecting  the
       rest  of  the  array.  If a name consists of an array name
       with no parenthesized index,  then  the  entire  array  is
       deleted.   The  unset command returns an empty string.  An
       error occurs if any of the variables  doesn't  exist,  and
       any  variables after the non-existent one are not deleted.
