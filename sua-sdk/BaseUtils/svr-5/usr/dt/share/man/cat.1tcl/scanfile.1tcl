       scanfile [-copyfile copyFileId] contexthandle fileId

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Scans the file specified by fileId, starting from the cur-
       rent file position, and checks all patterns  in  the  scan
       context  specified  by contexthandle against it, executing
       the match commands corresponding to patterns matched.

       If the optional -copyfile argument is specified, the  next
       argument  is  a  file ID to which all lines not matched by
       any pattern (excluding the  default  pattern)  are  to  be
       written.

                                                                1
