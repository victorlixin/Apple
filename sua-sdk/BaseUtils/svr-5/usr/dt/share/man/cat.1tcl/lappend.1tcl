       This  command  treats  the  variable given by varName as a
       list and appends each value argument to  that  list  as  a
       separate  element,  with spaces between elements.  If var-
       Name doesn't exist, it is created as a list with  elements
       given  by  the  value  arguments.   lappend  is similar to
       append except that the values are appended  as  list  ele-
       ments rather than raw text.  This command provides a rela-
       tively efficient way to build up large lists.   For  exam-
       ple,  lappend a $b is much more efficient than set a [con-
       cat $a [list $b]] when $a is long.
