       This command is used to collect a performance profile of a
       Tcl script.  It collects data at the Tcl procedure  level.
       The number of calls to a procedure, and the amount of real
       and CPU time are collected.  Time is  also  collected  for
       the  global  context.   The procedure data is collected by
       bucketing it based  on  the  procedure  call  stack.  This
       allows  determination  of how much time is spent in a par-
       ticular procedure in each of its calling contexts.

       The on option enables  profile  data  collection.  If  the
       -commands option is specified, data on all commands within
       a procedure is collected.  Multiple occurrences of a  com-
       mand  within  a  procedure are not distinguished, but this
       data may still be useful for analysis.

       The off option turns off profiling and moves the data col-
       lected to the array arrayVar.  The array is addressed by a
       list containing the procedure call stack.  Element zero is
       the  top of the stack, the procedure the data is for.  The
       data in each entry is a list consisting of  the  procedure
       call  count and the real time and CPU time in milliseconds
       spent in the procedure (and all procedures it called). The
       list  is  in  the  form:  {count real cpu} A Tcl procedure
       profrep is supplied for reducing the data and producing  a
       report.
