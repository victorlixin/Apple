       Returns the version number of Extended Tcl.   The  version
       number for Extended Tcl is generated by combining the base
       version of the standard Tcl code with a letter  indicating
       the version of Extended Tcl being used.  This is the docu-
       mentation for version 7.3b.  Returns  the  patchlevel  for
       Extended  Tcl.  Returns 1 if the flock command is defined,
       otherwise 0.  Returns 1 if the fsync system call is avail-
       able and the sync command will sync individual files, 0 if
       it is not available and the sync command will always  sync
       all  file  buffers.  Returns 1 if XPG message catalogs are
       available, 0 if they are not.  The catgets is designed  to
       continue  to  function  without  message  catalogs, always
       returning the default string.  Returns 1 if  POSIXtm  sig-
       nals  are  available  (block and unblock options available
       for the signal command).  0 is returned if  POSIX  signals
       are  not  available.   Returns  1 if sockets are available
       (server_open, server_info commands  and  fstat  removehost
       option).   0  is  returned  if  sockets are not available.
       Returns the  symbolic  application  name  of  the  current
       application  linked  with the Extended Tcl library.  The C
       variable tclAppName must be  set  by  the  application  to
       return  an  application-specific  value for this variable.
       Returns a natural language name for the  current  applica-
       tion.  The  C  variable  tclLongAppName must be set by the
       application to return an  application-specific  value  for
       this variable.  Returns the version number for the current
       application.  The C variable tclAppVersion must be set  by
       the  application  to  return an application-specific value
       for this variable.  Returns the patchlevel for the current
       application.   The C variable tclAppPatchlevel must be set
       by the application to return an application-specific value
       for this variable.
