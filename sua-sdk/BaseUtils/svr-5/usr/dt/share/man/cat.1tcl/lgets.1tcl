       Reads  the next Tcl list from the file given by fileId and
       discards the terminating newline character.  This  command
       differs  from the gets command, in that it reads Tcl lists
       rather than lines.  If the list contains a  newline,  then
       that newline will be returned as part of the result.  Only
       a newline not quoted as part of the list indicates the end
       of  the  list.  There is no corresponding command for out-
       putting lists, as puts will do this correctly.

       If varName is specified, then the line is  placed  in  the
       variable  by  that name and the return value is a count of
       the number of characters read (not including the newline).

       If the end of the file is reached before reading any char-
       acters then -1 is returned and varName is set to an  empty
       string.

       If  varName is not specified then the return value will be
       the line (minus the newline character) or an empty  string
       if the end of the file is reached before reading any char-
       acters.  An empty string will also be returned if  a  line
       contains no characters except the newline, so eof may have
       to be used to determine what really happened.

                                                                1
