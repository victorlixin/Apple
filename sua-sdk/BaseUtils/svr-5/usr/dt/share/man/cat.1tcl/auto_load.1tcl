       auto_load [command]

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Attempts  to  load  the  specified command from a loadable
       library, loading the package containing the procedure.  If
       the  package  indexes have not been loaded for all package
       libraries in  auto_path,  they  are  loaded.   Out-of-date
       library  indexes  are  rebuilt  if they are writable.  The
       procedure  returns  1  if  the  command  was  successfully
       loaded, or 0 if it was not.

       Duplicated package names are skipped; the first package of
       a given  name  found  in  the  path  is  loaded.   If  the
       auto_path  has  changed  since  the last load, indexes are
       reloaded (duplicate packages are not redefined).

       If command is not specified, the indexes  are  loaded,  if
       they  have  not  already  been  loaded or if the auto_path
       variable has changed, but no command is loaded.

       This command overrides the standard Tcl procedure  of  the
       same name.
