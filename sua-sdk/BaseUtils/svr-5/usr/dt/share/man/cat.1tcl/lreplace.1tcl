       lreplace  returns  a  new  list formed by replacing one or
       more elements of list with the element  arguments.   first
       gives  the  index  in  list  of  the  first  element to be
       replaced (0 refers to the first  element).   If  first  is
       less  than  zero  then  it  refers to the first element of
       list;  the element indicated by first must  exist  in  the
       list.  last gives the index in list of the last element to
       be replaced;  it must be greater than or equal  to  first.
       first  or  last  may be end (or any abbreviation of it) to
       refer to the last element of the list.  The element  argu-
       ments  specify  zero  or more new arguments to be added to
       the list in place of those that were deleted.   Each  ele-
       ment  argument will become a separate element of the list.
       If no element arguments are specified, then  the  elements
       between first and last are simply deleted.
