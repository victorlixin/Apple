       This  command provides information about various internals
       of the Tcl interpreter.  The legal options (which  may  be
       abbreviated)  are:  Returns a list containing the names of
       the arguments to procedure procname, in  order.   procname
       must  be the name of a Tcl command procedure.  Returns the
       body of procedure procname.  procname must be the name  of
       a  Tcl  command  procedure.   Returns a count of the total
       number of commands that have been invoked in  this  inter-
       preter.   If  pattern  isn't  specified, returns a list of
       names of all the Tcl commands, including both the built-in
       commands  written  in C and the command procedures defined
       using the proc command.  If  pattern  is  specified,  only
       those  names  matching  pattern are returned.  Matching is
       determined using the  same  rules  as  for  string  match.
       Returns  1  if  command  is  a complete Tcl command in the
       sense of having no unclosed quotes,  braces,  brackets  or
       array  element names:  if the command doesn't appear to be
       complete then 0 is returned.  This  command  is  typically
       used in line-oriented input environments to allow users to
       type in commands that span multiple lines;  if the command
       isn't  complete,  the script can delay evaluating it until
       additional lines have been typed to complete the  command.
       Procname  must  be the name of a Tcl command procedure and
       arg must be the name of an argument to that procedure.  If
       arg  doesn't have a default value then the command returns
       0.  Otherwise it returns 1 and places the default value of
       arg  into  variable  varname.   Returns  1 if the variable
       named varName exists in the current context (either  as  a
       global  or  local variable), returns 0 otherwise.  If pat-
       tern isn't specified, returns a list of all the  names  of
       currently-defined  global variables.  If pattern is speci-
       fied, only those  names  matching  pattern  are  returned.
       Matching  is determined using the same rules as for string
       match.  If number is not specified, this command returns a
       number  giving  the stack level of the invoking procedure,
       or 0 if the command is invoked at top-level.  If number is
       specified,  then  the  result  is a list consisting of the
       name and arguments for the procedure call at level  number
       on  the  stack.   If  number is positive then it selects a
       particular stack level (1 refers to  the  top-most  active
       procedure,  2 to the procedure it called, and so on); oth-
       erwise it gives a level relative to the current  level  (0
       refers  to the current procedure, -1 to its caller, and so
       on).  See the uplevel command for more information on what
       stack levels mean.  Returns the name of the library direc-
       tory in  which  standard  Tcl  scripts  are  stored.   The
       default value for the library is compiled into Tcl, but it
       may be overridden by setting the  TCL_LIBRARY  environment
       variable.  If there is no TCL_LIBRARY variable and no com-
       piled-in value then an error is generated.  See the manual

                                                                1

       entry  for  details  of the facilities provided by the Tcl
       script library.  Normally each application will  have  its
       own application-specific script library in addition to the
       Tcl script library.  Each application should consider set-
       ting  a  global  variable  with  a  name like $app_library
       (where app is the application's name) to hold the location
       of that application's library directory.  If pattern isn't
       specified, returns a list of all the names  of  currently-
       defined  local  variables (including arguments to the cur-
       rent procedure,  if  any).   Variables  defined  with  the
       global  and  upvar commands will not be returned.  If pat-
       tern is specified, only those names matching  pattern  are
       returned.   Matching is determined using the same rules as
       for string match.  Returns a decimal  integer  giving  the
       current  patch  level  for Tcl.  The patch level is incre-
       mented for each new release  or  patch,  and  it  uniquely
       identifies  an  official version of Tcl.  If pattern isn't
       specified, returns a list of all the names of Tcl  command
       procedures.   If  pattern  is  specified, only those names
       matching pattern are  returned.   Matching  is  determined
       using the same rules as for string match.  If a Tcl script
       file is currently being evaluated (that  is,  there  is  a
       call  to Tcl_EvalFile active or there is an active invoca-
       tion of the source command), then this command returns the
       name of the innermost file being processed.  Otherwise the
       command returns an empty string.  Returns the version num-
       ber for this version of Tcl in the form x.y, where changes
       to x represent major changes with probable  incompatibili-
       ties and changes to y represent small enhancements and bug
       fixes that  retain  backward  compatibility.   If  pattern
       isn't  specified,  returns a list of all the names of cur-
       rently-visible variables, including both locals  and  cur-
       rently-visible  globals.   If  pattern  is specified, only
       those names matching pattern are  returned.   Matching  is
       determined using the same rules as for string match.

                                                                2
