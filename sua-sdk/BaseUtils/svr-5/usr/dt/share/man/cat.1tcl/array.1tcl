       This  command  performs  one  of several operations on the
       variable given by arrayName.  arrayName must be  the  name
       of an existing array variable.  The option argument deter-
       mines what action is carried  out  by  the  command.   The
       legal options (which may be abbreviated) are: Returns 1 if
       there are any more elements left to  be  processed  in  an
       array   search,  0  if  all  elements  have  already  been
       returned.  searchId indicates which search on arrayName to
       check, and must have been the return value from a previous
       invocation of array startsearch.  This option is  particu-
       larly  useful  if  an  array  has an element with an empty
       name, since the return value from array nextelement  won't
       indicate whether the search has been completed.  This com-
       mand terminates an array search and destroys all the state
       associated  with  that  search.   searchId indicates which
       search on arrayName to destroy, and  must  have  been  the
       return  value  from  a previous invocation of array start-
       search.  Returns an empty string.  Returns a list contain-
       ing  the  names  of  all of the elements in the array.  If
       there are no elements in the array then an empty string is
       returned.   Returns the name of the next element in array-
       Name, or an empty string if all elements of arrayName have
       already  been returned in this search.  The searchId argu-
       ment identifies the search, and must have been the  return
       value  of an array startsearch command.  Warning:  if ele-
       ments are added to or deleted from  the  array,  then  all
       searches  are  automatically  terminated  just as if array
       donesearch had been invoked; this will  cause  array  nex-
       telement operations to fail for those searches.  Returns a
       decimal string giving the number of elements in the array.
       This  command  initializes  an  element-by-element  search
       through the array given by arrayName,  such  that  invoca-
       tions  of  the  array  nextelement command will return the
       names of the individual elements in the array.   When  the
       search  has  been  completed, the array donesearch command
       should be invoked.  The return value is a  search  identi-
       fier  that  must  be  used  in array nextelement and array
       donesearch commands; it allows  multiple  searches  to  be
       underway simultaneously for the same array.
