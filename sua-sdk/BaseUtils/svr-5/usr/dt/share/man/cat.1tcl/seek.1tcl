       seek fileId offset [origin]

       Changes  the  current  access position for fileId.  fileId
       must have been the return value from a  previous  call  to
       open,  or  it  may be stdin, stdout, or stderr to refer to
       one of the standard I/O channels.  The offset  and  origin
       arguments  specify  the position at which the next read or
       write will occur for fileId.  offset must  be  an  integer
       (which may be negative) and origin must be one of the fol-
       lowing: The new access position will be offset bytes  from
       the  start  of  the file.  The new access position will be
       offset bytes from the current access position; a  negative
       offset  moves  the  access position backwards in the file.
       The new access position will be offset bytes from the  end
       of the file.  A negative offset places the access position
       before the end-of-file, and a positive offset  places  the
       access  position  after the end-of-file.  The origin argu-
       ment defaults to start.  This  command  returns  an  empty
       string.
