       puts [-nonewline] [fileId] string

       Writes the characters given by string to the file given by
       fileId.  fileId must be the return value from  a  previous
       call  to  open,  or it may be stdout or stderr to refer to
       one of the standard I/O channels; it must refer to a  file
       that  was  opened  for writing.  If no fileId is specified
       then it defaults to stdout.  puts normally outputs a  new-
       line  character after string, but this feature may be sup-
       pressed by specifying the -nonewline  switch.   Output  to
       files is buffered internally by Tcl; the flush command may
       be used to force buffered characters to be output.
