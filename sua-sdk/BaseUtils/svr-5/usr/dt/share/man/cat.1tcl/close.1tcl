       Closes  the  file  given  by  fileId.   fileId must be the
       return value from a previous invocation of the  open  com-
       mand,  and  should not be used again after this close com-
       mand. If fileId refers to a command pipeline instead of  a
       file,  then  close waits for the children to complete. The
       normal result of this command  is  an  empty  string,  but
       errors  are  returned if there are problems in closing the
       file or waiting for children to complete.
