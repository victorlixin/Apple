       Reads  file  fileName  and  passes the contents to the Tcl
       interpreter as a script to evaluate in the normal fashion.
       The  return  value  from source is the return value of the
       last command executed from the file.  If an  error  occurs
       in  evaluating  the  contents  of the file then the source
       command will return that error.  If a  return  command  is
       invoked  from  within  the  file then the remainder of the
       file will be skipped and the source  command  will  return
       normally  with  the  result  from  the return command.  If
       fileName starts with a tilde, then it is tilde-substituted
       as described in the manual entry.
