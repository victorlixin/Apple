       This  procedure  writes  the named procedures, or all cur-
       rently defined procedures, to a temporary file, then calls
       an  editor  on  it (as specified by the EDITOR environment
       variable, or if none is specified), then sources the  file
       back in if it was changed.

                                                                1
