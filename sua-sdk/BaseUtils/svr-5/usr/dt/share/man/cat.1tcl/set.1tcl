       Returns the value of variable varName.  If value is speci-
       fied, then it sets the value of varName to value, creating
       a  new  variable if one doesn't already exist, and returns
       its value.  If varName contains an  open  parenthesis  and
       ends  with a close parenthesis, then it refers to an array
       element: the characters before the first open  parenthesis
       are  the name of the array, and the characters between the
       parentheses are the index  within  the  array.   Otherwise
       varName  refers  to a scalar variable.  If no procedure is
       active, then varName refers to a global  variable.   If  a
       procedure is active, then varName refers to a parameter or
       local variable of the procedure unless the global  command
       has been invoked to declare varName to be global.
