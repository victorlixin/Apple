       for start test next body

       A  looping  command,  similar  in  structure  to the C for
       statement.  The start, next, and body  arguments  must  be
       Tcl  command  strings,  and  test is an expression string.
       The for command first invokes the Tcl interpreter to  exe-
       cute  start.   Then  it  repeatedly  evaluates  test as an
       expression; if the result is non-zero it invokes  the  Tcl
       interpreter  on  body, then invokes the Tcl interpreter on
       next, then repeats the loop.  The command terminates  when
       test  evaluates  to  0.   If a continue command is invoked
       within body then any remaining  commands  in  the  current
       execution  of  body  are  skipped; processing continues by
       invoking the Tcl  interpreter  on  next,  then  evaluating
       test,  and  so  on.   If a break command is invoked within
       body or next, then the for  command  will  return  immedi-
       ately.  The operation of break and continue are similar to
       the corresponding statements in C.  The command returns an
       empty string.
