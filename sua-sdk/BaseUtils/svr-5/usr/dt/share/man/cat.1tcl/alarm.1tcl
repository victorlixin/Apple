       Instructs the system to send a SIGALRM signal in the spec-
       ified number of seconds.  This is a floating point number,
       so fractions of a section may be specified.  If seconds is
       0.0, any previous alarm request  is  canceled.   Only  one
       alarm  at  a  time  may be active; the command returns the
       number of seconds left in the previous alarm.  On  systems
       without  the  setitimer system call, seconds is rounded up
       to an even number of seconds.
