       error message [info] [code]

       Returns a TCL_ERROR code, which causes command interpreta-
       tion to be unwound. message is a string that  is  returned
       to the application to indicate what went wrong.

       If  the  info argument is provided and is non-empty, it is
       used to initialize the global variable  errorInfo.  error-
       Info  is  used  to accumulate a stack trace of what was in
       progress  when  an  error  occurred;  as  nested  commands
       unwind, the Tcl interpreter adds information to errorInfo.
       If the info argument is present, it is used to  initialize
       errorInfo  and  the  first increment of unwind information
       will not be added by the Tcl interpreter. In other  words,
       the  command  containing the error command will not appear
       in errorInfo; in its place will be info.  This feature  is
       most  useful  in  conjunction with the catch command: if a
       caught error cannot be handled successfully, info  can  be
       used to return a stack trace reflecting the original point
       of occurrence of the error: catch {...} errMsg set  saved-
       Info  $errorInfo ...  error $errMsg $savedInfo If the code
       argument is present, then  its  value  is  stored  in  the
       errorCode  global  variable.  This variable is intended to
       hold a machine-readable description of the error in  cases
       where such information is available.  If the code argument
       is not present, then errorCode is automatically  reset  to
       NONE  by  the  Tcl  interpreter  as part of processing the
       error generated by the command.
