       lmatch [mode] list pattern

       Searches  the  elements  of  list, returning a list of all
       elements matching pattern.  If none match, an  empty  list
       is returned.

       The  mode  argument indicates how the elements of the list
       are to be matched against pattern and it must have one  of
       the  following  values:  The  list  element  must  contain
       exactly the same string as pattern.  pattern  is  a  glob-
       style  pattern  which is matched against each list element
       using the same rules as the string match command.  pattern
       is  treated  as  a  regular expression and matched against
       each list element using the same rules as the regexp  com-
       mand.

       If mode is omitted then it defaults to -glob.

                                                                1
