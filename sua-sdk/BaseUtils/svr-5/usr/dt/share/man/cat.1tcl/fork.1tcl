       Forks  the  current Tcl process.  fork returns zero to the
       child process and the process number of the child  to  the
       parent  process.  If the fork fails, a Tcl error is gener-
       ated.

       If an execl is not going to be performed before the  child
       process  does  output,  or  if a close and dup sequence is
       going to be performed on stdout or stderr,  then  a  flush
       should be issued against stdout, stderr and any other open
       output file before doing the  fork.  Otherwise  characters
       from  the  parent  process  pending in the buffers will be
       output by both the parent and child processes.

                                                                1
