       ctype  determines  whether all characters in string are of
       the specified class.  It returns 1  if  they  are  all  of
       class,  and  0 if they are not, or if the string is empty.
       This command also provides another method (besides  format
       and scan) of converting between an ASCII character and its
       numeric value.  The following ctype  commands  are  avail-
       able:  Tests that all characters are alphabetic or numeric
       characters as defined by the character  set.   Tests  that
       all characters are alphabetic characters as defined by the
       character set.  Tests that all  characters  are  an  ASCII
       character  (a  non-negative  number less than 0200).  Con-
       verts the numeric value, number, to  an  ASCII  character.
       number must be in the range 0 through 255.  Tests that all
       characters are control characters as defined by the  char-
       acter  set.   Tests  that all characters are valid decimal
       digits, that is, 0 through 9.  Tests that  all  characters
       are  any  character  for which ctype print is true, except
       for space characters.  Tests that all characters are  low-
       ercase  letters as defined by the character set.  Converts
       a character into its decimal  numeric  value.   The  first
       character  of  the  string  is  converted.  Tests that all
       characters are either a  space,  horizontal-tab,  carriage
       return,  newline,  vertical-tab, or form-feed.  Tests that
       all characters are a space  or  any  character  for  which
       ctype alnum or ctype punct is true or other printing char-
       acter as defined by the character  set.   Tests  that  all
       characters are made up of any of the characters other than
       the ones for which alnum, cntrl, or space is true.   Tests
       that  all  characters  are uppercase letters as defined by
       the character set.  Tests that all  characters  are  valid
       hexadecimal  digits, that is 0 through 9, a through f or A
       through F.

       If -failindex is specified, then the index into string  of
       the  first  character  that  did  not  match  the class is
       returned in var.

                                                                1
