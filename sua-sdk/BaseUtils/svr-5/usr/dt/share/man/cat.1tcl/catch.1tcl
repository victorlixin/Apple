       The  catch  command  may  be  used  to prevent errors from
       aborting  command  interpretation.  catch  calls  the  Tcl
       interpreter  recursively  to  execute  script,  and always
       returns a TCL_OK code, regardless of any errors that might
       occur  while executing script. The return value from catch
       is a decimal string giving the code returned  by  the  Tcl
       interpreter   after  executing  script.  This  will  be  0
       (TCL_OK) if there were no errors in script;  otherwise  it
       will  have  a  non-zero  value corresponding to one of the
       exceptional return codes (see tcl.h for the definitions of
       code  values).  If  the varName argument is given, then it
       gives the name of a variable; catch will set the  variable
       to  the string returned from script (either a result or an
       error message).
