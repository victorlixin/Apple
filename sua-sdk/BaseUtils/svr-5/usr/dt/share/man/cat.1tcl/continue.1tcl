       This  command  may  be  invoked  only inside the body of a
       looping command such  as  for  or  foreach  or  while.  It
       returns  a  TCL_CONTINUE code to signal the innermost con-
       taining loop command to skip the remainder of  the  loop's
       body but continue with the next iteration of the loop.

                                                                1
