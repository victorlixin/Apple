       Loads  the  package library index of the library file lib-
       file (which must have  the  suffix  auto_path  are  loaded
       automatically  on  the  first demand_load; this command is
       provided to explicitly load libraries that are not in  the
       path.   If  the  index file (with a .tndx suffix) does not
       exist or is out of date, it is rebuilt  if  the  user  has
       directory  permissions to create it. If a package with the
       same name as a package in libfile.tlib  has  already  been
       loaded,  its  definition is overridden by the new package.
       However, if any procedure has actually been used from  the
       previously  defined  package,  the  procedures  from  lib-
       file.tlib are not loaded.

       This command also loads an index built by the  mkindex.tcl
       program  supplied  with  standard  Tcl.  This file must be
       named tclIndex.
