       Opens the message catalog catname.  This may be a relative
       pathname, in which case the NLSPATH  environment  variable
       is  searched to find an absolute path to the message cata-
       log.  A handle in the form msgcatN is returned.  Normally,
       errors  are  ignored,  and in the case of a failed call to
       catopen, a handle is returned to an unopened message cata-
       log.  (This handle may still be passed to catgets and cat-
       close,  causing  catgets  to  simply  return  the  default
       string, as described above.  If the -fail option is speci-
       fied, an error is returned if the open fails.  The  option
       -nofail specifies the default behavior of not returning an
       error when catopen fails to open a specified message cata-
       log.   If  the  handle  from a failed catopen is passed to
       catgets, the default string is returned.
