       split string [splitChars]

       Returns a list created by splitting string at each charac-
       ter that is in the splitChars argument.  Each  element  of
       the result list will consist of the characters from string
       that  lie  between  instances   of   the   characters   in
       splitChars.   Empty  list  elements  will  be generated if
       string contains adjacent characters in splitChars,  or  if
       the  first  or  last character of string is in splitChars.
       If splitChars is an empty string then  each  character  of
       string  becomes  a  separate  element  of the result list.
       splitChars defaults to the  standard  white-space  charac-
       ters.   For  example,  split  "comp.unix.misc"  .  returns
       comp unix misc and split  "Hello world"  {} returns H e  l
       l o { } w o r l d.
