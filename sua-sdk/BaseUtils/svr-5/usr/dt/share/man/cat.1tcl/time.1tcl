       This  command  calls  the  Tcl  interpreter count times to
       evaluate script (or once if count  isn't  specified).   It
       then  returns  a  string of the form: 503 microseconds per
       iteration which  indicates  the  average  amount  of  time
       required per iteration, in microseconds.  Time is measured
       in elapsed time, not CPU time.
