       This  command  sorts the elements of list, returning a new
       list in sorted order.  By default, ASCII sorting is  used,
       with  the  result  returned in increasing order.  However,
       any of the following switches may be specified before list
       to  control  the sorting process (unique abbreviations are
       accepted): Use  string  comparison  with  ASCII  collation
       order.   This  is  the  default.  Convert list elements to
       integers and use integer comparison.   Convert  list  ele-
       ments to floating-point values and use floating-point com-
       parison.  Use command as a comparison command.  To compare
       two  elements, evaluate a Tcl script consisting of command
       with the two elements appended  as  additional  arguments.
       The  script  should return an integer less than, equal to,
       or greater than zero if the first element is to be consid-
       ered  less  than,  equal  to,  or greater than the second,
       respectively.  Sort the list in increasing order (smallest
       items  first).   This  is  the  default.  Sort the list in
       decreasing order (largest items first).
