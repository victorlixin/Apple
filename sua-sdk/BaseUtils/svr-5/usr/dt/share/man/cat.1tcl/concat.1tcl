       This  command  treats each argument as a list and concate-
       nates them into a single list.  It also eliminates leading
       and  trailing spaces in the args and adds a single separa-
       tor space between args.  It permits any  number  of  argu-
       ments.  For  example, the command concat a b {c d e} {f {g
       h}} will return a b c d e f {g h} as its result.

       If no args are supplied, the result is an empty string.
