       This  command  is  not  a  core  part of Tcl, but Tcl will
       invoke it if it does exist (that is, if a function  called
       unknown  has been written and linked to Tcl in the current
       application).  If the Tcl interpreter encounters a command
       name  for  which  there is not a defined command, then Tcl
       checks for the existence of a command named  unknown.   If
       there  is no such command, then the interpreter returns an
       error.  If the unknown command exists, then it is  invoked
       with  arguments  consisting  of the fully-substituted name
       and arguments for the original non-existent command.   The
       unknown  command  typically  does  things  like  searching
       through library directories for a command  procedure  with
       the  name  cmdName, or expanding abbreviated command names
       to full-length, or automatically  executing  unknown  com-
       mands  as sub-processes.  In some cases (such as expanding
       abbreviations) unknown will change  the  original  command
       slightly  and  then  (re-)execute  it.   The result of the
       unknown command is used as the  result  for  the  original
       non-existent command.
