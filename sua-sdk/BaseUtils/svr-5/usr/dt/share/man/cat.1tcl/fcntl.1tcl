       This  command  either  sets  or  clears  a  file option or
       returns its current value.  If  value  is  not  specified,
       then  the current value of attribute is returned. The fol-
       lowing attributes may be specified: The file is opened for
       reading  only.  (Get  only) The file is opened for writing
       only.  (Get only) The file is opened for reading and writ-
       ing.   (Get only) If the file is readable. (Get only).  If
       the file is writable. (Get only).  The file is opened  for
       append-only  writes.  All writes will be forced to the end
       of the file.  The file is to be accessed with non-blocking
       I/O.  See the read system call for a description of how it
       affects the behavior of file reads.  Close the file  on  a
       process  exec.   If the execl command or some other mecha-
       nism causes the process to do an exec, the  file  will  be
       closed  if  this option is set.  The file is not buffered.
       If set, then there is no stdio  buffering  for  the  file.
       Output to the file is line buffered. The buffer is flushed
       when a newline is written, when the  buffer  is  full,  or
       when input is requested.

       The APPEND, NONBLOCK, and CLOEXEC attributes may be set or
       cleared by specifying the attribute name and the  value  1
       to set the attribute or 0 to clear it.

       The  NOBUF and LINEBUF attributes can only be set (a value
       of 1), not  cleared;  only  one  of  the  options  may  be
       selected.  Once set, it may not be changed.  These options
       should be set before any I/O operations have been done  on
       the file or data may be lost.

                                                                1
