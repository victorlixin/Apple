       random limit | seed [seedval]

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Generates  a  pseudo-random integer number greater than or
       equal to zero and less than limit.  If seed is  specified,
       then  the  command resets the random number generator to a
       starting point derived from the seedval. This  allows  you
       to  reproduce  pseudo-random  number sequences for testing
       purposes.  If seedval is omitted, then the seed is set  to
       a  value  based  on  current  system state and the current
       time, providing a reasonably interesting and ever-changing
       seed.
