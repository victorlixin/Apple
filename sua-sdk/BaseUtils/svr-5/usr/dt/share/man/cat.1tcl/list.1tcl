       list [arg arg ...]

       This  command returns a list comprised of all the args, or
       an empty string if no  args  are  specified.   Braces  and
       backslashes  are  added  as  necessary, so that the lindex
       command may be used on the result to re-extract the origi-
       nal  arguments,  and also so that eval may be used to exe-
       cute the resulting list, (with arg1  comprising  the  com-
       mand's  name and the other args comprising its arguments).
       list produces slightly different results to concat:   con-
       cat removes one level of grouping before forming the list,
       while list works directly  from  the  original  arguments.
       For  example,  the command list a b {c d e} {f {g h}} will
       return a b {c d e} {f {g h}} while concat  with  the  same
       arguments will return a b c d e f {g h}
