       Flushes  any  output  that  has  been buffered for fileId.
       fileId must have been the return  value  from  a  previous
       call  to open, or it may be stdout or stderr to access one
       of the standard I/O streams; it must refer to a file  that
       was  opened  for  writing.   The  command returns an empty
       string.
