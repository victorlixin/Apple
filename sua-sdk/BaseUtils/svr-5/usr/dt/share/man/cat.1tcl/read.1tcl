       In  the  first  form,  all of the remaining bytes are read
       from the file given by fileId; they are  returned  as  the
       result of the command.  If the -nonewline switch is speci-
       fied then the last character of the file is  discarded  if
       it  is  a newline.  In the second form, the extra argument
       specifies how many bytes to read; exactly this many  bytes
       will  be  read  and  returned, unless there are fewer than
       numBytes bytes left in the file; in  this  case,  all  the
       remaining bytes are returned.  fileId must be stdin or the
       return value from a previous call to open; it  must  refer
       to  a file that was opened for reading.  Any existing end-
       of-file or error condition on the file is cleared  at  the
       beginning of the read command.
