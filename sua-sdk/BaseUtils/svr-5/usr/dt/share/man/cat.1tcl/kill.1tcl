       Sends a signal to each process in the list idlist, if per-
       mitted.  signal, if present, is the signal number  or  the
       symbolic  name of the signal; see for details. The leading
       SIG is optional when the signal is specified by  its  sym-
       bolic name.  The default for signal is 15, SIGTERM.

       If  -pgroup  is specified, the numbers in idlist are taken
       as process group IDs and the signal is sent to all of  the
       processes  in that process group.  A process group ID of 0
       specifies the current process group.
