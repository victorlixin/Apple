       Waits for a process created with the execl command to ter-
       minate, either due to an untrapped signal or a call to  an
       exit  system call.  If the process ID pid is specified, it
       waits for that process, otherwise it waits for  any  child
       process to terminate.

       If  -nohang  is  specified,  then waiting for a process to
       terminate is not blocked.  If no  process  is  immediately
       available,  it  returns  an  empty  list.  If -untraced is
       specified then the status  of  child  processes  that  are
       stopped  and  whose status has not yet been reported since
       they stopped, is also returned.  If -pgroup  is  specified
       and  pid is not specified, then it waits on any child pro-
       cess whose process group ID is the  same  as  the  calling
       process.  If  pid  is  specified  with -pgroup, then it is
       taken as a process group ID, waiting  on  any  process  in
       that process group to terminate.

       wait  returns  a list containing three elements: the first
       element is the process ID of the process that  terminated.
       If  the  process  exited  normally,  the second element is
       ``EXIT'', and the third contains the  numeric  exit  code.
       If the process terminated due to a signal, the second ele-
       ment is ``SIG'', and the third contains the  signal  name.
       If  the process is currently stopped (on systems that sup-
       port SIGSTP), the second element is ``STOP'', followed  by
       the signal name.

       It is possible to wait on processes to terminate that were
       created in the background with the exec command.  However,
       if  any  other  exec command is executed after the process
       terminates, then the process status will be reset  by  the
       exec  command  and  will not be available to the wait com-
       mand.
