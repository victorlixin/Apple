       This  command  produces  a new list from list by inserting
       all of the element arguments into list, after  index  ele-
       ments  of  the  current  list.  Each element argument will
       become a separate element of the new list.   If  index  is
       less  than  or  equal  to  zero, then the new elements are
       inserted at the beginning of the list.  If index  has  the
       value end, or if it is greater than or equal to the number
       of elements  in  the  list,  then  the  new  elements  are
       appended to the list.
