       Obtains status information about an open file.

       The  following  keys  are used to identify data items: The
       time of last access.  The time of last file status change.
       The  device  containing  a  directory  for the file.  This
       value uniquely identifies the filesystem that contains the
       file.   The  group ID of the file's group.  The inode num-
       ber.  This field uniquely identifies the file in  a  given
       filesystem.   The  mode  of the file (see the mknod system
       call).  The time when the data in the file was last  modi-
       fied.   The number of links to the file.  The file size in
       bytes.  If the file is associated with a terminal, then 1;
       otherwise 0.  The type of the file in symbolic form, which
       is one of the following values: file,  directory,  charac-
       terSpecial, blockSpecial, fifo, link, or socket.  The user
       ID of the file's owner.

       If one of these keys is specified as item, then that  data
       item is returned.

       If  stat  arrayvar  is  specified, then the information is
       returned in the array arrayvar.  Each of  the  above  keys
       indexes an element of the array containing the data.

       If  only fileId is specified, the command returns the data
       as a keyed list.

       The following value may be  returned  only  if  explicitly
       asked for. It will not be returned with the array or keyed
       list forms: If fileId is a TCP/IP socket connection,  then
       a list is returned with the first element being the remote
       host IP address.  If the remote host name can be found, it
       is returned as the second element of the list.

                                                                1
