       Returns immediately from the current  procedure  (or  top-
       level  command  or  source  command),  with  string as the
       return value.  If string is not specified  then  an  empty
       string will be returned as result.

       In  the usual case where the -code option is not specified
       the procedure returns normally (with a completion code  of
       TCL_OK).   However, the -code option may be used to gener-
       ate an exceptional return from the  procedure.   code  may
       have  any of the following values: Normal return: the same
       as if the option were omitted.  Error return: the same  as
       if the error command were used to terminate the procedure,
       except for handling of errorInfo and  errorCode  variables
       (see below).  The current procedure returns with a comple-
       tion code  of  TCL_RETURN,  so  that  the  procedure  that
       invoked  it  returns  also.  The current procedure returns
       with a completion code of TCL_BREAK, which terminates  the
       innermost nested loop in the code that invoked the current
       procedure.  The current procedure returns with  a  comple-
       tion  code  of  TCL_CONTINUE, which terminates the current
       iteration of the innermost nested loop in  the  code  that
       invoked  the current procedure.  value must be an integer;
       it is returned as the completion code for the current pro-
       cedure.   The -code option is rarely used.  It is provided
       so that procedures that implement new  control  structures
       can  reflect exceptional conditions back to their callers.

       Two additional options, -errorinfo and -errorcode, may  be
       used   to  provide  additional  information  during  error
       returns.  These options are ignored unless code is  error.

       The -errorinfo option specifies an initial stack trace for
       the errorInfo variable; if it is not  specified  then  the
       stack  trace  left  in  errorInfo includes the call to the
       procedure and higher levels on the stack but it  does  not
       include  any  information  about  the context of the error
       within the procedure.  Typically the info  value  is  sup-
       plied  from the value left in errorInfo after a catch com-
       mand traps an error within the procedure.

       If the -errorcode option is specified then code provides a
       value  for  the  errorCode variable.  If the option is not
       specified then errorCode defaults to NONE.

                                                                1
