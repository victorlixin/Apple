       The  while command evaluates test as an expression (in the
       same way that expr evaluates its argument).  The value  of
       the  expression must be a proper boolean value; if it is a
       true value then body is executed by passing it to the  Tcl
       interpreter.   Once  body  has  been executed then test is
       evaluated again, and the process repeats until  eventually
       test  evaluates  to  a false boolean value.  continue com-
       mands may be executed inside body to terminate the current
       iteration  of the loop, and break commands may be executed
       inside body to cause immediate termination  of  the  while
       command.   The  while  command  always  returns  an  empty
       string.
