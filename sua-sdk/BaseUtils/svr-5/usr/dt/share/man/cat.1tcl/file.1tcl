       This  command provides several operations on a file's name
       or attributes.  name is the name of a file; if  it  starts
       with  a tilde, then tilde substitution is done before exe-
       cuting the command (see  the  manual  page  for  details).
       option  indicates  what  to  do  with  the file name.  Any
       unique abbreviation for option is acceptable.   The  valid
       options  are:  Returns a decimal string giving the time at
       which file name was last accessed.  The time  is  measured
       in  the  standard  POSIXtm fashion as seconds from a fixed
       starting time  (often  January  1,  1970).   If  the  file
       doesn't exist or its access time cannot be queried then an
       error is generated.  Returns all of the characters in name
       up  to  but  not  including  the last slash character.  If
       there are no slashes in name then returns ..  If the  last
       slash  in  name  is  its  first character, then returns /.
       Returns 1 if file name is executable by the current  user,
       0  otherwise.   Returns 1 if file name exists and the cur-
       rent user has search privileges for the directories  lead-
       ing  to it, 0 otherwise.  Returns all of the characters in
       name after and including the last dot in name.   If  there
       is  no dot in name then returns the empty string.  Returns
       1 if file name is a directory, 0 otherwise.  Returns 1  if
       file  name  is  a regular file, 0 otherwise.  Same as stat
       option (see below)  except  uses  the  lstat  kernel  call
       instead of stat.  This means that if name refers to a sym-
       bolic link the information returned in varName is for  the
       link  rather  than the file it refers to.  On systems that
       don't support symbolic links this option  behaves  exactly
       the  same  as  the  stat option.  Returns a decimal string
       giving the time at which file name was last modified.  The
       time  is measured in the standard POSIX fashion as seconds
       from a fixed starting time (often January  1,  1970).   If
       the  file  doesn't  exist  or  its modified time cannot be
       queried then an error is generated.   Returns  1  if  file
       name is owned by the current user, 0 otherwise.  Returns 1
       if file name is readable by the current user, 0 otherwise.
       Returns  the value of the symbolic link given by name (the
       name of the file it points to).  If name isn't a  symbolic
       link  or  its  value  cannot  be  read,  then  an error is
       returned.  On systems that don't  support  symbolic  links
       this  option  is undefined.  Returns all of the characters
       in name up to but not including the last  .  character  in
       the  name.   If  name  doesn't contain a dot, then returns
       name.  Returns a decimal string giving the  size  of  file
       name in bytes.  If the file doesn't exist or its size can-
       not be queried then an error is  generated.   Invokes  the
       stat  kernel  call on name, and uses the variable given by
       varName to hold information returned from the kernel call.
       varName is treated as an array variable, and the following
       elements of that variable are set: atime, ctime, dev, gid,

                                                                1

       ino,  mode,  mtime,  nlink, size, type, uid.  Each element
       except type is a decimal string with the value of the cor-
       responding  field  from the stat return structure; see the
       manual page for details on the  meanings  of  the  values.
       The  type  element  gives the type of the file in the same
       form returned by the  command  file  type.   This  command
       returns an empty string.  Returns all of the characters in
       name after the last slash.  If name  contains  no  slashes
       then  returns  name.   Returns a string giving the type of
       file name, which will be one of file,  directory,  charac-
       terSpecial,  blockSpecial, fifo, link, or socket.  Returns
       1 if file name is writable by the current user,  0  other-
       wise.
