       regsub [switches] exp string subSpec varName

       This  command  matches  the regular expression exp against
       string, and copies string to the variable  whose  name  is
       given  by  varName.   The  command returns 1 if there is a
       match and 0 if there isn't.  If there  is  a  match,  then
       while  copying  string  to  varName, the portion of string
       that matches exp is replaced  with  subSpec.   If  subSpec
       contains  a  & or \0, then it is replaced in the substitu-
       tion with the portion of string that matches exp.  If sub-
       Spec  contains  a  \n, where n is a digit between 1 and 9,
       then it is replaced in the substitution with  the  portion
       of string that matches the nth parenthesized subexpression
       of exp.  Additional backslashes may be used in subSpec  to
       prevent  special  interpretation of & or \0 or \n or back-
       slash.  The use of backslashes in subSpec tends to  inter-
       act  badly with the Tcl parser's use of backslashes, so it
       is generally safest to enclose subSpec  in  braces  if  it
       includes backslashes.

       If  the initial arguments to regexp start with - then they
       are treated as switches.  The following switches are  cur-
       rently  supported: All ranges in string that match exp are
       found and substitution is  performed  for  each  of  these
       ranges.  Without this switch only the first matching range
       is found and substituted.  If -all is  specified,  then  &
       and  \n  sequences are handled for each substitution using
       the information from the corresponding match.   Upper-case
       characters  in  string  are  converted to lowercase before
       matching against exp;  however, substitutions specified by
       subSpec  use  the  original  unconverted  form  of string.
       Marks the end of switches.  The  argument  following  this
       one is treated as exp even if it starts with a -.  See the
       manual entry for for details on the interpretation of reg-
       ular expressions.
