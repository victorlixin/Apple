       Performs  one  of  several string operations, depending on
       option.  The legal options (which may be abbreviated) are:
       Performs  a  character-by-character  comparison of strings
       string1 and string2 in the same way as the C strcmp proce-
       dure.   It  returns  -1,  0,  or  1,  depending on whether
       string1 is  lexicographically  less  than,  equal  to,  or
       greater  than string2.  Searches string2 for a sequence of
       characters that exactly match the characters  in  string1.
       If  found,  it returns the index of the first character in
       the first such match within string2.   If  not  found,  it
       returns  -1.   Returns  the  charIndex'th character of the
       string argument.  A charIndex  of  0  corresponds  to  the
       first  character of the string.  If charIndex is less than
       0 or greater than or equal to the  length  of  the  string
       then  an empty string is returned.  Searches string2 for a
       sequence of characters that exactly match  the  characters
       in  string1.   If found, it returns the index of the first
       character in the last such match within string2.  If there
       is no match, then it returns -1.  Returns a decimal string
       giving the number of characters in string.  Checks if pat-
       tern  matches  string;  returns  1  if  it  does,  0 if it
       doesn't.  Matching is done in a fashion  similar  to  that
       used  by the C-shell.  For the two strings to match, their
       contents must be identical except that the following  spe-
       cial sequences may appear in pattern: Matches any sequence
       of characters in string, including a null string.  Matches
       any  single character in string.  Matches any character in
       the set given by chars.  If a sequence  of  the  form  x-y
       appears  in  chars,  then  any  character between x and y,
       inclusive, will match.  Matches the  single  character  x.
       This provides a way of avoiding the special interpretation
       of the characters *?[]\ in pattern.  Returns  a  range  of
       consecutive  characters  from  string,  starting  with the
       character whose index is first and ending with the charac-
       ter  whose  index  is  last.   An index of 0 refers to the
       first character of the string.  last may be  end  (or  any
       abbreviation  of it) to refer to the last character of the
       string.  If first is less than zero then it is treated  as
       if  it  were zero, and if last is greater than or equal to
       the length of the string then it is treated as if it  were
       end.   If  first is greater than last then an empty string
       is returned.  Returns a value equal to string except  that
       all  upper case letters have been converted to lower case.
       Returns a value equal to string except that all lower case
       letters  have  been  converted  to  upper case.  Returns a
       value equal to string except that any leading or  trailing
       characters  from  the  set given by chars are removed.  If
       chars  is  not  specified  then  white  space  is  removed
       (spaces, tabs, newlines, and carriage returns).  Returns a
       value equal to string except that any  leading  characters

                                                                1

       from  the set given by chars are removed.  If chars is not
       specified then white space is removed (spaces, tabs,  new-
       lines,  and  carriage  returns).  Returns a value equal to
       string except that any trailing characters  from  the  set
       given  by  chars  are  removed.  If chars is not specified
       then white space is removed (spaces, tabs,  newlines,  and
       carriage returns).
