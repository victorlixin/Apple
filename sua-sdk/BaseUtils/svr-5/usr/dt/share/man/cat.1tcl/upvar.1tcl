       This  command  arranges for one or more local variables in
       the current procedure to refer to variables in an  enclos-
       ing procedure call or to global variables.  level may have
       any of the forms permitted for the  uplevel  command,  and
       may  be  omitted if the first letter of the first otherVar
       isn't # or a digit (it defaults to 1).  For each  otherVar
       argument,  upvar  makes  the  variable by that name in the
       procedure frame given by level (or  at  global  level,  if
       level  is  #0)  accessible in the current procedure by the
       name given in the corresponding myVar argument.  The vari-
       able  named  by otherVar need not exist at the time of the
       call;  it will be created the first time myVar  is  refer-
       enced,  just like an ordinary variable.  upvar may only be
       invoked from within procedures.  myVar may not refer to an
       element  of  an  array, but otherVar may refer to an array
       element.  upvar returns an empty string.

       The upvar command simplifies the implementation  of  call-
       by-name  procedure  calling  and  also  makes it easier to
       build new control constructs as Tcl procedures.  For exam-
       ple, consider the following procedure: proc add2 name {
           upvar $name x
           set  x  [expr $x+2] } add2 is invoked with an argument
       giving the name of a variable, and  it  adds  two  to  the
       value  of  that  variable.   Although add2 could have been
       implemented using uplevel instead of upvar, upvar makes it
       simpler  for  add2  to access the variable in the caller's
       procedure frame.

       If an upvar variable is unset (e.g. x in add2 above),  the
       unset  operation affects the variable it is linked to, not
       the upvar variable.  There is no way  to  unset  an  upvar
       variable  except  by  exiting the procedure in which it is
       defined.  However, it is possible  to  retarget  an  upvar
       variable by executing another upvar command.

                                                                1
