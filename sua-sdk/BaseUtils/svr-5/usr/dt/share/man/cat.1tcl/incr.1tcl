       Increments  the value stored in the variable whose name is
       varName.  The value of the variable must  be  an  integer.
       If  increment is supplied then its value (which must be an
       integer) is added to the value of variable varName;   oth-
       erwise  1 is added to varName.  The new value is stored as
       a decimal string in variable varName and also returned  as
       result.
