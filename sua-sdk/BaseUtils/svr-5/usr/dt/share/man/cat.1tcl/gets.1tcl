       gets fileId [varName]

       This  command  reads  the next line from the file given by
       fileId and discards the terminating newline character.  If
       varName  is specified then the line is placed in the vari-
       able by that name and the return value is a count  of  the
       number of characters read (not including the newline).  If
       the end of the file is reached before reading any  charac-
       ters  then  -1  is returned and varName is set to an empty
       string.  If varName is not specified then the return value
       will be the line (minus the newline character) or an empty
       string if the end of the file is  reached  before  reading
       any  characters.  An empty string will also be returned if
       a line contains no characters except the newline,  so  eof
       may have to be used to determine what really happened.  If
       the last character in the file is not a newline  character
       then  gets  behaves as if there were an additional newline
       character at the end of the file.  fileId must be stdin or
       the  return  value  from  a previous call to open; it must
       refer to a file that was opened for reading.  Any existing
       end-of-file  or  error condition on the file is cleared at
       the beginning of the gets command.
