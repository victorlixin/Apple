       This  command  manages file scan contexts.  A scan context
       is a collection of regular  expressions  and  commands  to
       execute when that regular expression matches a line of the
       file.  A context may also have a single default match,  to
       be applied against lines that do not match any of the reg-
       ular expressions.  Multiple scan contexts may  be  defined
       and  they may be reused on multiple files.  A scan context
       is identified by a context handle.  The  scancontext  com-
       mand  takes  the  following forms: Creates a new scan con-
       text.  The scanmatch command is used to define patterns in
       the  context.  A context handle is returned, which the Tcl
       programmer uses to refer to the newly created scan context
       in  calls  to the Tcl file scanning commands.  Deletes the
       scan context identified by contexthandle, and frees all of
       the  match  statements  and  compiled  regular expressions
       associated with the specified context.
