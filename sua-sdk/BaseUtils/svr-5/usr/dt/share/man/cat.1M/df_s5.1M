       generic_options are options supported by  the  generic  df
       command.

       The  df  command  prints out the number of free blocks and
       free i-nodes in s5 file systems or directories by  examin-
       ing  the  counts  kept  in  the super-blocks.  The special
       device name (for example, /dev/dsk/*, where the value of *
       is  machine-dependent)  or mount point directory name (for
       example, /mnt) must be specified.  If directory is  speci-
       fied,  the report presents information for the device that
       contains the directory.

       Specifies the s5-FSType.  File system types can be autode-
       tected  so in principle this option is no longer required.
       However, df executes faster if the  file  system  type  is
       specifed rather than having to be autodetected.  An actual
       count of the blocks in the free list is made, rather  than
       taking the figure from the super-block.

       The -f option can be used with the -t, -b, and -e options.
       The -k option overrides the -f option.
