       queries the Storage Device Interface  (SDI)  subsystem  to
       determine  which disk, tape, and SCSI controllers are pre-
       sent.  sdiconfig reads the  Equipped  Device  Table  (EDT)
       built by the SDI drivers and outputs this information in a
       format suitable for piping directly to

       sdiconfig accepts the following options: Uses  this  value
       instead  of / for the root of a kernel source tree.  Force
       the named driver to be turned on in the current  SDI  con-
       figuration.   driver name is the short name of the driver.
       This option is repeatable.   Directs  output  to  filename
       instead  of to standard output.  List SDI controllers con-
       figured on the system.  This option can be run only by the
       root user.

       The  output  includes  all  of  the  information needed by
       diskcfg to reconfigure the system files so that  a  kernel
       can  be  built  containing  only  those drivers needed for
       devices actually present on the system.

       The format of the output for  sdiconfig  is:  driver  name
       long  driver  name  driver type configure flag unit number
       dma channel 1 dma channel 2  ipl  level  interrupt  vector
       interrupt  sharing  flag  starting  I/O address ending I/O
       address starting memory address ending memory address  cpu
       binding

       Each  field  has a value present and is tab separated.  If
       an error occurs while trying to retrieve the EDT  or  con-
       figuration  information, or if no devices are found in the
       EDT, sdiconfig terminates with a  non-zero  return  value.
       sdiconfig  does  not  use the ROOT shell variable from the
       user's environment as its starting path.  You can  specify
       a  value  for  ROOT by using the -R option.  The -R option
       should not be used except for the special case  of  kernel
       development in a non-root source tree.

UUssaaggee
       sdiconfig  is an administrative command and must be run in
       single-user mode.  See for information  on  switching  the
       machine to single-user mode.

       Any  loadable  target  drivers, such as and must be demand
       loaded before executing sdiconfig.  See for information on
       loading loadable drivers.

       On  success,  sdiconfig exits with a return code of 0.  On
       failure, it returns a non-zero code.
