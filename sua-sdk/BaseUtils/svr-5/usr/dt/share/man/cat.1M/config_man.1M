       The config_man script examines the documentation distribu-
       tion  files (HTML and metadata files) in the given mansec-
       tion directories or, if no mansection is specified, on the
       entire  set of mansection directories, and then constructs
       the necessary files that connect the man  pages  into  the
       &scohelp;  system.  mansection is the section suffix name,
       such as 1M.  See also

       If the -L option is specified, the processes  are  run  on
       the given language (LANG); otherwise all language versions
       are processed.  If LANG is not English, the processes  are
       also run on the topicID directories in the en_US.ISO8859-1
       hierarchy.  For example, the following command  runs  con-
       fig_man on all the topicID directories under the es (Span-
       ish  language)  and  en_US.ISO8859-1  (English   language)
       directories:  config_man  -L es If the -n option is speci-
       fied, all processing takes place except  the  final  full-
       text  indexing  step.  The bulk insert files are generated
       and placed  in  /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/_SearchIndex/Insert,
       ready  to  be  indexed, but the bulk insert process is not
       performed.  This permits several documentation packages to
       be processed before running the (sometimes lengthy) index-
       ing process on the whole set.  If the  -n  option  is  not
       specified,  config_man  runs automatically.  The installa-
       tion script should always run the last call to  config_man
       without the -n option so the new man pages get indexed.

       Use -d mandir to specify the location of the man directory
       if  the  man  pages  are  not  installed  in  the  default
       /usr/lib/scohelp/en_US.ISO8859-1/man  directory (linked to
       /usr/man).  For example, -d /usr/local/man.

       Because config_man must be run to include manual pages  in
       the  index,  whatis  and search databases, run this script
       whenever new man pages or man page packages are installed.
       You  must  run config_man on your man pages, regardless of
       the format (HTML, man macro, or cat (preformatted ASCII)).
       Run  after config_man to process the view stanza files and
       update the REFhome.html manual page section list.

       The config_man script performs the following  actions  for
       man  sections:  Regenerate man section tables of contents.
       Generate man index and whatis files.   Generate  full-text
       search indexes.

       For each mansection installed, config_man creates the fol-
       lowing files: man/.SectionData/titles/mansection man/.Sec-
       tionData/toc/mansection  man/.SectionData/index/mansection
       man/.SectionData/whatis/mansection

                                                                1

config_man(1M)                                     config_man(1M)

       _SearchIndex/Insert/man.mansection.vbi  When config_search
       is  run,  the  man.mansection.vbi  file   moves   to   the
       _SearchIndex/Indexed/ directory.

       In  addition,  config_man  also  merges  the man/.Section-
       Data/index files into the master man/index file, and  com-
       bines  the  man/.SectionData/whatis  files into the master
       man/whatis file.

       When a man page  or  man  page  package  is  removed,  the
       removal  script  should  delete  only  the  files  that it
       installed.  After the removal script removes the files  it
       installed,  the  script  should  run  config_man  and con-
       fig_views.  The config_man script updates the files in the
       .SectionData  directories  to  reflect which man pages and
       sections are  left  on  the  system  and  also  moves  the
       man.mansection.vbi  file to the _SearchIndex/Delete direc-
       tory.  The config_man script also runs config_search auto-
       matically  (if  the  -n option is not specified) to remove
       the index entries from the  search  databases.   The  con-
       fig_views  script  removes  the man pages or man page sec-
       tions from the views.

       If, after removing man pages or man page  packages,  there
       are  no  man  pages left on the system, config_man removes
       the .SectionData and master index and whatis files.

       The  configuration  works  from   whatever   material   is
       installed  when  the script is run.  As such, it works for
       new installation, updates, and  removals.   The  processes
       are  repeatable,  so  processing material that has already
       been processed does not result in error.  The scripts  can
       be  run  again  on the same installed material and produce
       the same results.
