       The  showpicture  program  allows  a  user  on a properly-
       equipped workstation to view a picture, contained  in  the
       file  specified by filename, using the xloadimage program.
       It is intended to be called from a mailcap file, typically
       by the metamail program.

       By default, the program used to display pictures under X11
       is issued as: xloadimage -view -quiet -geometry +1+1  This
       can  be  overridden  either  by  the  environment variable
       X_VIEWER or on the command line with the -viewer option.

UUssaaggee
       If X11 is not running, this program has no effect.
