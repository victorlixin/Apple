       killall  is  used by /usr/sbin/shutdown to kill all active
       processes not directly related to the shutdown  procedure.

       killall  terminates  all processes with open files so that
       the mounted  filesystems  will  be  unbusied  and  can  be
       unmounted.

       killall  sends  signal (see to all processes not belonging
       to the above group of exclusions.  If no signal is  speci-
       fied, a default of 9 (SIGKILL) is used.

       The  killall command can be run only by a privileged user.

       If the killall command is issued in an environment where a
       mouse  is  used,  the  mousemgr itself will be terminated.
       Subsequently, any process which uses a mouse  (such  as  X
       Windows) will wait for the mousemgr indefinitely, since it
       no longer exists at this point.  Therefore, it  is  advis-
       able  to  terminate  any  process that uses a mouse before
       issuing the killall command.
