       ufsdump backs up all files in filesystem, where filesystem
       represents a special device, or files changed after a cer-
       tain  date,  to  magnetic  tape;  options is a string that
       specifies ufsdump options, as shown below.  Any  arguments
       supplied  for  specific  options  are  given as subsequent
       words on the command line, in the same order  as  that  of
       the options listed.

       If no options are given, the default is 9u.

       The  dump  level.   All  files in the filesystem that have
       been modified since the last ufsdump at a lower dump level
       are  copied  to  the  volume.   For instance, if you did a
       level 2 dump on Monday, followed by  a  level  4  dump  on
       Tuesday, a subsequent level 3 dump on Wednesday would con-
       tain all files modified or added since the level  2  (Mon-
       day)  backup.  A level 0 dump copies the entire filesystem
       to the dump volume.  Blocking factor.  Specify the  block-
       ing  factor for tape writes.  The default is 20 blocks per
       write.  The blocking  factor  is  specified  in  terms  of
       512-byte  blocks, for compatibility with tar.  The default
       blocking factor for tapes of density 6250BPI  and  greater
       is 64.  The default blocking factor for cartridge tapes (c
       option specified) is 126.   The  highest  blocking  factor
       available with most tape drives is 126.  Cartridge.  Use a
       cartridge instead of the standard  half-inch  reel.   This
       sets  the  density  to  1000BPI and the blocking factor to
       126.  The length is set  to  425  feet.   This  option  is
       incompatible  with the d option, unless you specify a den-
       sity of 1000BPI with that option.  Tape density.  The den-
       sity  of  the  tape,  expressed in BPI, is taken from bpi.
       This is used to keep a running tab on the amount  of  tape
       used  per  reel.   The  default density is 1600 except for
       cartridge tape.  Unless  a  higher  density  is  specified
       explicitly,  ufsdump  uses  its default density -- even if
       the tape drive is capable of higher-density operation (for
       instance,  6250BPI).   The density specified should corre-
       spond to the density of the tape  device  being  used,  or
       ufsdump  will  not be able to handle end-of-tape properly.
       Dump file.  Use dump-file as the file to dump to,  instead
       of /dev/rmt*.  If dump-file is specified as -, dump to the
       standard output.  Notify all  operators  in  the  operator
       group  that ufsdump requires attention by sending messages
       to their terminals, in a manner similar to  that  used  by
       the  wall  command.   Specify the size of the volume being
       dumped to.  When the specified size  is  reached,  ufsdump
       waits  for  you  to change the volume.  ufsdump interprets
       the specified size as the length in  feet  for  tapes  and
       cartridges,  and  as  the  number  of 1024-byte blocks for

                                                                1

       diskettes.  The following  are  defaults:  425  feet  1422
       blocks (corresponds to a 1.44 Mb diskette, with one cylin-
       der reserved for bad block information) Specify the number
       of  tracks for a cartridge tape.  The default is 9 tracks.
       The t option is not compatible with the D option.   Update
       the dump record.  Add an entry to the file /etc/dumpdates,
       for each filesystem successfully dumped that includes  the
       filesystem  name,  date, and dump level.  This file can be
       edited by a privileged user.  List  the  filesystems  that
       need  backing  up.   This  information is gleaned from the
       files /etc/dumpdates and /etc/vfstab.  When the  w  option
       is  used, all other options are ignored.  After reporting,
       ufsdump exits  immediately.   Similar  to  the  w  option,
       except  that  the  W  option includes all filesystems that
       appear in /etc/dumpdates,  along  with  information  about
       their  most  recent  dump  dates and levels.  File systems
       that need backing up are highlighted.

       Each  reel requires a new process, so parent processes for
       reels already written just hang around  until  the  entire
       tape is written.

       It is recommended that incremental dumps also be performed
       with the system running in single-user mode.
