       The  fsfpreset utility is used by the fontmgr program (the
       Fonts application in the Preferences folder of  the  Desk-
       top)  to  reset  the catalogue of the font server whenever
       any Type 1 scalable outline fonts are added or deleted  by
       the user, or when the Actions or Integrity Check menu item
       is used.  Desktop is opened.)  Its function is similar  in
       purpose to the xset fp rehash command for the X server.

       The  Desktop  is  configured so that the X server gets its
       fonts from two local sources: the misc fonts directory and
       the  local font server.  The font server catalogue defines
       the scalable outline font  directory  type1  and  the  two
       bitmapped font directories 75dpi and 100dpi.  All 3 direc-
       tories are in  /usr/X/lib/fonts.   By  default,  the  font
       server  in  UnixWare renders Type 1 fonts using Adobe Type
       Managertm.

       In vanilla X11R5, when xset fp rehash  is  run,  only  the
       directories  in  the X server's font path are re-read, not
       the font server directories.  No utility  is  provided  in
       X11R5 to request the font server to reread the directories
       defined in its catalogue; it does reread them, however, if
       sent  a  SIGUSR1 signal.  fsfpreset is a UnixWare-specific
       utility that sends the needed SIGUSR1 signal to the  local
       font  server  process, causing it to re-read its catalogue
       of available fonts.

       The one argument to fsfpreset is the port  number  of  the
       font server process.  Using this number, fsfpreset locates
       the process ID of the font  server  process  in  the  file
       /dev/X/fs.port-number.pid (this process ID is put there by
       the font server, fs, when it starts up),  and  sends  that
       process the SIGUSR1 signal.

       fsfpreset  must  run setuid, and with the same permissions
       as the fs process itself; in UnixWare this is bin, a  sys-
       tem id.

       The  fontmgr process obtains the port number argument used
       by fsfpreset by getting the font server element out of the
       X server's  font  path;  it  does this for each local font
       server in the X server font path.  (The default port  num-
       ber in UnixWare is 7000.)
