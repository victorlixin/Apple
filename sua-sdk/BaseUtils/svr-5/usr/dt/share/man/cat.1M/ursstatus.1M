       With no options, ursstatus reports the status of all pend-
       ing  user  restore requests that are posted in the restore
       status table.

       This command can request a status report  for  only  those
       restore requests that the user has initiated.

       Suppresses header for the report.  Restricts the report to
       the specified jobs.  jobids is a list of restore  job  IDs
       (either  comma-separated or blank-separated and surrounded
       by quotes).  jobids must be valid for  the  user  invoking
       the  command.  Suppresses field wrap and specifies an out-
       put field separator to be used.   field_separator  is  the
       character  that  will appear as the field separator in the
       output displayed.  A null field_separator will use  a  tab
       character as a separator.  Restricts the report to pending
       restore jobs that could  be  satisfied  by  the  specified
       device type or volumes.  ddev describes the device or vol-
       umes used to select requests to be restored.  ddev  is  of
       the  form:  [dtype][:dlabels] where dtype is a device type
       (such as diskette, cartridge tape, or 9-track  tape).   If
       specified,  restrict  the  report  to posted requests that
       could be satisfied by volumes of the type specified.

       dlabels is a list of volume  names  corresponding  to  the
       volumename  displayed by the labelit command.  dlabels may
       be either  comma-separated  or  blank-separated  and  sur-
       rounded  by  quotes.  If specified, restrict the report to
       posted requests that could  be  satisfied  by  an  archive
       residing  on  the specified volumes.  Restricts the report
       to requests  submitted  by  the  specified  users  (either
       comma-separated   or  blank-separated  and  surrounded  by
       quotes).  users must be listed in the passwd file.
