       generic_options  are options supported by the generic vol-
       copy command.  current_options are  options  supported  by
       the s5-specific module of volcopy.

       volcopy makes a literal copy of the ufs filesystem using a
       blocksize matched to the device.

       Specify the ufs FSType. If -F ufs is not specified heuris-
       tics  similiar  to those used by are used to determine the
       file system type.  This command executes faster if  it  is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify  the  -F  ufs.   Invoke  a  verification  sequence
       requiring  a  positive  operator  response  instead of the
       standard 10-second delay before the copy is made.   Assume
       a yes response to all questions.

       Other  options  are  used  with both 9-track and cartridge
       tapes (cartridge tapes are treated as if they were 9-track
       tapes.)  bits per inch size of reel in feet beginning reel
       number for a restarted copy use double buffered  I/O  pro-
       cess  until the end of tape, then ask for the next tape in
       sequence.

       If the -e option is not  selected,  the  program  requests
       length and density information if this is not given on the
       command line or if it is not recorded  on  an  input  tape
       label.  If the filesystem is too large to fit on one reel,
       volcopy prompts for additional reels.  Labels of all reels
       are  checked.   Tapes may be mounted alternately on two or
       more drives.  If volcopy is interrupted, it  asks  if  the
       user  wants  to  quit  or  wants  to escape to the command
       interpreter.  In the latter case,  the  user  can  perform
       other  operations  (such as labelit) and return to volcopy
       by exiting the command  interpreter.   The  -e  and  -feet
       options  are mutually exclusive.  The fsname argument rep-
       resents the mounted name (for example, root, usr,  and  so
       on) of the filesystem being copied.

       The  srcdevice  or destdevice should be the disk partition
       or tape.  For example, /dev/rdsk/*  or  /dev/rmt/*,  where
       the value of * is machine specific.

       The volname is the physical volume name.  Such label names
       contain up to six characters.  volname may be - to use the
       existing volume name.

       srcdevice  and  volname1  are  the  device and volume from
       which the copy  of  the  filesystem  is  being  extracted.

                                                                1

volcopy_ufs(1M)                                   volcopy_ufs(1M)

       destdevice  and volname2 are the target device and volume.

       fsname and volname are recorded in the superblock.

       volcopy does not support tape-to-tape  copying.   Use  for
       tape-to-tape copying.
