       One  of  the  ID/TP  kernel  configuration tools, idmkinit
       reconstructs    /etc/inittab    from    the    files    in
       /etc/conf/init.d.   The  new inittab is normally placed in
       the /etc/conf/cf.d directory, although this can be changed
       through the -o option.

       The command-line options are: Create inittab in the direc-
       tory specified, instead of  the  default,  /etc/conf/cf.d.
       Use  the init files in the directory specified, instead of
       the default location, /etc/conf/init.d.  Append the  init-
       tab  lines  generated from the Init file, if there is one,
       of the loadable kernel module specified to /etc/inittab so
       it can take effect.  Print debugging information.

       In the sysinit state during the next system reboot after a
       kernel reconfiguration, the  idmkinit  command  is  called
       automatically   (by  idmkenv)  to  establish  the  correct
       /etc/inittab  for  the  running  (newly   built)   kernel.
       idmkinit  is  also  called by idbuild when loadable kernel
       module configuration is requested.  idmkinit for the  run-
       ning  (newly  built)  kernel.   can be executed as a user-
       level command before a Driver Software  Package  (DSP)  is
       actually built.  It is also useful in installation scripts
       that do not reconfigure the kernel, but which need to cre-
       ate  inittab entries.  In this case, the inittab generated
       by idmkinit must be copied to /etc/inittab, and an init  q
       command must be run for the new entry to take effect.

       An  exit  value of zero indicates success.  If an error is
       encountered, idmkinit will exit with a non-zero value  and
       report an error message.
