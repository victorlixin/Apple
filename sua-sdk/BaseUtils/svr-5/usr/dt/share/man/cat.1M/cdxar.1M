       cdxar displays the Extended Attribute Record (XAR) associ-
       ated with a File Section of a file or directory.  The out-
       put  is  a  table that lists each field in the XAR and its
       contents.  If the -b option is not used,  the  Application
       Use  field  and  the Escape Sequences field are not listed
       because they may contain non-printable  characters.   File
       or  directory  in  the  CD-ROM file system.  Specifies the
       File Section for which the XAR shall be read.  The number-
       ing  starts with one.  If this option is omitted, the last
       File Section of that file is assumed.  Displays the XAR in
       binary format, including the Application Use Field and the
       Escape Sequences field.

       IF LC_TIME (which determines the format  and  contents  of
       the  date  and  time  strings) is not set or is set to the
       empty string, then cdxar uses the value of LANG.  If  LANG
       is  not set, or is set to the empty string, cdxar uses the
       value from the implementation-specific default locale.  If
       both  LC_TIME  and  LANG  contain  invalid settings, cdxar
       behaves as if all of the variables are undefined.
