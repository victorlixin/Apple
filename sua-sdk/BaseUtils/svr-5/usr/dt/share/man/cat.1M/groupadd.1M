       The groupadd command creates a new group definition on the
       system by adding the appropriate entry to  the  /etc/group
       file.

       The  following options are available: The group ID for the
       new group.  This group ID must be a  non-negative  decimal
       integer  below  MAXUID  as defined in the <param.h> header
       file.  By default, a unique group ID is allocated  in  the
       valid range.  Group IDs from 0-99 are reserved.  The path-
       name of a directory containing two customization  scripts,
       groupadd.pre  and groupadd.post, to be executed before and
       after creation of the group,  respectively.   This  option
       allows the gid to be duplicated (non-unique).  A string of
       printable characters that specifies the name  of  the  new
       group.   It  may  not include a colon (:) or newline (\n).
       If group is preceded by a + or - character, (for  example,
       +student),  the  group  definition will be administered by
       the Network Information Service (NIS).  Values for the  -g
       and  -o  options will be silently ignored if these options
       are specified.  Instead, the value for group  ID  will  be
       taken from the NIS database.  See for more information.
