       tunefs is designed to change the dynamic parameters  of  a
       filesystem which affect the layout policies.  The filesys-
       tem must be unmounted before using tunefs.  The parameters
       which are to be changed are indicated by the options given
       below:

   CCoommmmaanndd ooppttiioonnss
       Specify the maximum number of contiguous blocks that  will
       be  laid  out  before  forcing  a rotational delay (see -d
       below).  The default  value  is  one,  since  most  device
       drivers  require  an  interrupt per disk transfer.  Device
       drivers that can chain several buffers together in a  sin-
       gle  transfer should set this to the maximum chain length.
       Specify the expected time (in milliseconds) to  service  a
       transfer  completion interrupt and initiate a new transfer
       on the same disk.  It is used to  decide  how  much  rota-
       tional  spacing  to  place  between successive blocks in a
       file.  Indicate the maximum number of  blocks  any  single
       file  can  allocate  out  of a cylinder group before it is
       forced to begin allocating blocks  from  another  cylinder
       group.   Typically  this value is set to approximately one
       quarter of the total blocks  in  a  cylinder  group.   The
       intent is to prevent any single file from using up all the
       blocks in a single cylinder group, thus  degrading  access
       times  for all files subsequently allocated in that cylin-
       der group.  The effect of this limit is to cause big files
       to do long seeks more frequently than if they were allowed
       to allocate all the blocks  in  a  cylinder  group  before
       seeking elsewhere.  For filesystems with exclusively large
       files, this parameter should be set higher.   Specify  the
       percentage of space held back from normal users; the mini-
       mum free space threshold.  The default value used is  10%.
       This  value  can be set to zero, however up to a factor of
       three in throughput will  be  lost  over  the  performance
       obtained at a 10% threshold.  If the value is raised above
       the current usage level, users will be unable to  allocate
       files  until  enough  files have been deleted to get under
       the higher threshold.  minfree also  determines  when  the
       filesystem  will  automatically  switch between time opti-
       mization and space optimization. If there  are  more  than
       (minfree  -2)  percent free fragments, the filesystem will
       switch to space optimization. If minfree is less  than  5,
       then  any  switch  to time optimization will be inhibited.
       Change optimization strategy for the  filesystem.   s  and
       space are interchangeable, and t and time are interchange-
       able.  Conserve space.  Organize file layout  to  minimize
       access time.

                                                                1

tunefs(1M)                                             tunefs(1M)

       Generally one should optimize for time unless the filesys-
       tem is over 90% full.
