       The fdetach command detaches a STREAMS-based file descrip-
       tor from a name in the filesystem.  path is  the  pathname
       of the object in the filesystem name space, which was pre-
       viously attached (see The user must be the  owner  of  the
       file  or a user with the appropriate privileges.  All sub-
       sequent operations on path operate on the filesystem  node
       and  not  on the STREAMS file.  The permissions and status
       of the node are restored to the state they were in  before
       the STREAMS file was attached to it.
