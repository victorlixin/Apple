       repquota prints a summary of the disk usage and quotas for
       the specified filesystems.  For each user the current num-
       ber of  files  and  amount  of  space  (in  kilobytes)  is
       printed, along with any quotas created with edquota.

       An  error  message  is  returned  if you run repquota on a
       filesystem that does not have a quotas file  in  the  root
       directory.

       Only  privileged users may view quotas which are not their
       own.  repquota is supported on the ufs and vxfs FStypes.

       Specify the FSType on which to operate.  If -F  FSType  is
       not  specified  it  is  determined by matching the inputfs
       device with an  entry  in  /etc/vfstab.   If  this  fails,
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the file system type.  If the FSType is known  beforehand,
       use  the  -F option. This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system  types.   Echo  the
       complete  command  line,  but  do not execute the command.
       The command line is generated by  using  the  options  and
       arguments provided by the user and adding to them informa-
       tion derived from /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used
       to  verify and validate the command line.  Specify FSType-
       specific options.
