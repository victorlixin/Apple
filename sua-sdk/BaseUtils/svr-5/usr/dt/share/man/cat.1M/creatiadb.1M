       The  creatiadb  command creates the /etc/security/ia/index
       and /etc/security/ia/master files.  It is invoked by  init
       through  an  entry  in  the  file at system initialization
       time.  The files are created after each system boot.

       If there are errors, a message is written to  the  console
       and to the file /var/adm/creatialog.

       Note   that  a  NIS  user  with  an  entry  in  /etc/secu-
       rity/ia/index and /etc/security/ia/master will  always  be
       authenticated  via their entry in these local I&A security
       databases.  In order for a NIS user  to  be  authenticated
       via the password database on the NIS server, the local I&A
       security databases must not  contain  an  entry  for  that
       user.  See for information on how to create such users.
