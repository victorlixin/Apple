       The  dmi command is used to start or stop the Desktop Man-
       agement Interface (DMI) Service Provider  daemons,  dmispd
       and oncsp.

       The  dmispd  daemon  is  the  Desktop Management Interface
       (DMI) Service Provider program that mediates  between  the
       management interface and the component interface, perform-
       ing services on behalf of both of them.

       The oncsp daemon makes the  Service  Provider's  Component
       Interface and Management Interface available over RPC.

       sion.  By default, you will not have write  permission  on
       startup.

       DMI  will  start  automatically  at system startup time if
       /etc/init.d/dmi is linked to /etc/rc2.d/S89dmi

       DMI will stop automatically at  system  shutdown  time  if
       /etc/init.d/dmi is linked to /etc/rc0.d/K30dmi
