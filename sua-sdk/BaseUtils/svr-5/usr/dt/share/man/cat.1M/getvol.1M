       getvol  verifies  that  the specified device is accessible
       and that a volume  of  the  appropriate  medium  has  been
       inserted.    The   command  is  interactive  and  displays
       instructional  prompts,  describes   errors,   and   shows
       required label information.  getvol uses the device table,
       /etc/device.tab, to determine the characteristics  of  the
       device when performing the volume label checking.

       getvol  has the following options: Run the command in non-
       interactive mode.  The volume is assumed  to  be  inserted
       upon  command  invocation.   Specify  that the label label
       must exist on the inserted volume (can  be  overridden  by
       the  -o option).  Format the volume after insertion, using
       the format command defined for this device in  the  device
       table.   Format  the  volume  after insertion and places a
       filesystem on the device.  Also uses  the  format  command
       defined  for  this  device in the device table.  Allow the
       administrator to write a new label on the device.  User is
       prompted  to  supply the label text.  This option is inef-
       fective if the -n option is enabled.  Allow  the  adminis-
       trator to override a label check.  Specifie that the label
       label must exist on the device.   This  option  should  be
       used  instead  of the -l option when the label can only be
       verified by visual means.  Use of the option causes a mes-
       sage  to be displayed asking the administrator to visually
       verify that the label is indeed label.   Name  the  device
       which should be verified for accessibility.

       On success, getvol returns 0.  On failure, it returns 1 if
       the command syntax was incorrect, an  invalid  option  was
       used,  or  an internal error occurred, or returns 3 if the
       device table could not be opened for reading.
