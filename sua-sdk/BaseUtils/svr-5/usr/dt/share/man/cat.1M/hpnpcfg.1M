       hpnpcfg is a menu driven configuration utility for config-
       uring HP  Network  Printers.  An  HP  Network  Printer  is
       attached  directly to the network using a built-in network
       card.

       The hpnpcfg configuration tasks main menu  supplies  eight
       options for checking and modifying the configuration of an
       HP Network Printer. These options are: Verify installation
       of software

       Verifies  that  all  the software needed to support the HP
       Network Printer has been properly installed.  Configure  a
       printer with BOOTP/TFTP

       Modifies   the   file   /etc/inetd.conf   to  include  the
       ``bootps'' service so that the Network Printer can use the
       BOOT Protocol to download its configuration. Configuration
       values are the ethernet address of  the  Network  Printer,
       the  network  name  for  the  printer,  subnet mask if the
       printer resides within a subnet, a gateway  mask  so  that
       hosts  outside the subnet can access the printer, the name
       of the syslog server for printer error messages, the  idle
       time-out  value,  the access list of hosts that can access
       the printer, and SNMP related parameters such as location,
       contact  person,  community  name, traps and trap destina-
       tions.

       Note   that   it   is   necessary   to   manually   modify
       /etc/inetd.conf   to   include   TFTP   support.    Verify
       BOOTP/TFTP configuration

       Not supported.  Verify network printer connectivity

       Uses the utility to verify that the printer is  responding
       to network requests.  Verify network printer operations

       Allows the administrator to test the operation of the Net-
       work Printer by sending files to the printer. These  files
       are  a  text  test  file  and a PostScript test file.  Add
       printer to spooler

       Uses to add the Network Printer to the  list  of  printers
       accessible  via the command. A special interface script is
       used to pass the output of the printer interface script to
       a filter, Remove printer BOOTP/TFTP configuration

       Removes the specified Network Printer's BOOTP/TFTP config-
       uration.  Remove printer from spooler

                                                                1

hpnpcfg(1M)                                           hpnpcfg(1M)

       Removes the specified  Network  Printer's  system  spooler
       configuration.   In  addition,  the menu supplies Help and
       Quit options.

       For details of BOOTP and TFTP, see the and manual pages.

       You must run /usr/lib/hpnp/hpnpinstall when installing the
       first    Network    Printer.   This   amends   the   files
       /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services to support the boot pro-
       tocol (BOOTP) used by the printers. It also installs util-
       ities and printer interface programs  used  by  the  print
       service.  Once  the installation script has completed, you
       run hpnpcfg to configure  individual  printers.   See  for
       more details.
