       pkgrm  will  remove  a  previously  installed or partially
       installed package/set from the system.   A  package  is  a
       collection  of  related  files and executables that can be
       independently installed.  A set is made up of  a  special-
       purpose package, referred to as a Set Installation Package
       (SIP), and a collection of one or more packages  that  are
       members of the set.

       pkgrm  checks that all packages listed on the command line
       are on the system.  If any of the packages listed does not
       exist, no changes are made to the system, that is, none of
       the listed packages are removed.

       A check is also made to determine if  any  other  packages
       depend  on  the  one being removed.  The action taken if a
       dependency exists is defined in the admin file (see the -a
       option, below).

       The  default  state  for  the command is interactive mode,
       meaning that prompt messages are given  during  processing
       to  allow  the  administrator to confirm the actions being
       taken.  Non-interactive mode can be requested with the  -n
       option.

       The  -s  option  can be used to specify the directory from
       which spooled packages should be removed.

       The options and arguments for this command are: Non-inter-
       active mode.  If there is a need for interaction, the com-
       mand will exit.  Use of this option requires that at least
       one  package instance be named upon invocation of the com-
       mand.  Defines an installation administration file, admin,
       to  be  used  in place of the default administration file.
       [For a description of the format of an admin file, see The
       token  none  overrides the use of any admin file, and thus
       forces interaction with the user.  Unless a full  pathname
       is  given,  pkgrm  looks  in  the  /var/sadm/install/admin
       directory for the file.  By default, the file  default  in
       that  directory is used.  Removes the specified package(s)
       from the directory spool.  A short string used  to  desig-
       nate  an abbreviation for the package/set name.  (The term
       ``package instance'' is used loosely:  it  refers  to  all
       instantiations  of pkginst, even those that do not include
       instance identifiers.)  See and

       If pkginst specifies a SIP, all installed  packages  which
       are members of the set, and the SIP itself, are removed in
       reverse dependency order.

       To indicate all instances of a package, specify  enclosing
       the  command  line  in single quotes, as shown, to prevent
       the shell from interpreting  the  *  character.   Use  the
