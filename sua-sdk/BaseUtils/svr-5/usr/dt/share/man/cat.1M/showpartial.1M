       The  showpartial  program uses the type message/partial to
       identify the body of a MIME-format message and attempts to
       fetch  each of the pieces for later use.  When showpartial
       is called on the  last  piece,  it  will  put  the  pieces
       together  and  call  metamail to display the full message.
       It is intended to be called  by  metamail  via  a  mailcap
       entry  modeled after the following: message/partial; show-
       partial %s %{id} %{partnum} %{totalnum} The parts are tem-
       porarily saved on /tmp, which can be a problem, since /tmp
       can fill up before the remaining parts are fetched.   When
       the  message is finally displayed, via metamail, the parts
       are all discarded, and the user is asked whether or not to
       delete the file containing the entire message.
