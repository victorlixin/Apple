       ati  auto-recognizes baud rates and modem model. ati sends
       out a known ATI command at a range of speeds  and  reports
       back  which  speeds the modem works at. ati also sends out
       the full range of ATI  commands  and  compares  the  modem
       replies with the database to find the best match. ati nor-
       mally probes ATI0 to ATI9 unless the  -i  option  is  set.
       ati is found in /usr/lib/uucp.

       The following options are available: Baud rate to use. The
       default is 9600.  ATI number to  probe.   Probe  for  baud
       rates.   Quiet  mode.   String  to  use for the modem. The
       default is ATE0Q0V1M0L0.  If no options are set, ati sends
       ATI  commands  to the modem. It reports what type of modem
       was  autodetected.  For   example:   #   /usr/lib/uucp/ati
       /dev/term/01m Sending ATI1

       The  following  modem(s)  are  matching the autodetection:
       Hayes_Accura_56K_Ext_Speakerphone_Modem_5670

       If the -b option is set, ati probes the  modem  using  the
       baud  rate  specified.  It  reports what type of modem was
       autodetected. For example: #  /usr/lib/uucp/ati  -b  14400
       /dev/term/01m  The  following  modem(s)  are  matching the
       autodetection:               Hayes_Accura_56K_Ext_Speaker-
       phone_Modem_5670

       If  the  -i  option is set, ati probes the modem using the
       ATI number specified. For example: # /usr/lib/uucp/ati  -i
       3 /dev/term/01m Probing ATI3: OK

       V1.120HZ-K56_DLS

       If  the -p option is set, ati probes the modem to find out
       what baud rates are supported. It produces  a  message  on
       the  screen  saying  what  baud rate it is trying and then
       reports what baud rates the modem supports. For example: #
       /usr/lib/uucp/ati -p /dev/term/01m Trying 2400 bauds

       #  /usr/lib/uucp/ati  -p  /dev/term/01m Bauds: 1200, 4800,
       9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, 76800, 115200

       If the -s option is set, ati probes the  modem  using  the
       string  specified.  For  example:  #  /usr/lib/uucp/ati -s
       ATE0Q0V1M0L0  /dev/term/01m  The  following  modem(s)  are
       matching  the autodetection: Hayes_Accura_56K_Ext_Speaker-
       phone_Modem_5670

                                                                1
