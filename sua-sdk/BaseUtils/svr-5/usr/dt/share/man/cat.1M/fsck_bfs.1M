       generic_options are options supported by the generic  fsck
       command.

       fsck  checks  to  see if compaction was in process but was
       not completed, perhaps as a result of a system crash.   If
       it  was,  fsck  completes  the compaction of the file (see
       bfs-specific

       Specify the bfs FSType. If -F bfs is not specified heuris-
       tics  similiar  to those used by are used to determine the
       file system type.  This command executes faster if  it  is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify the -F bfs.  Assume a yes response  to  all  ques-
       tions  asked  by  fsck.  Assume a no response to all ques-
       tions asked by fsck.
