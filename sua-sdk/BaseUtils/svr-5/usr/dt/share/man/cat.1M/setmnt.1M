       setmnt  creates  the /etc/mnttab table which is needed for
       both the mount and umount commands.  setmnt reads standard
       input  and  creates  a  mnttab entry for each line.  Input
       lines have the format: filesys node where filesys  is  the
       name   of  the  filesystem's  ``special  file''  (such  as
       /dev/dsk/c?b?t?d?s?)  and node is the root  name  of  that
       filesystem.   Thus  filesys  and node become the first two
       strings in the mount table entry.

       Problems may occur if filesys or node are longer  than  32
       characters.

       setmnt  silently  enforces  an  upper limit on the maximum
       number of mnttab entries.
