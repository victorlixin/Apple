       custom allows a privileged user to create a custom instal-
       lation by selectively installing or deleting  portions  of
       packages  written to be installed on &everest; (or earlier
       versions of SCO UNIX) systems.  Note that custom+ and cus-
       tom+  format  package  options  are not supported.  If you
       don't provide information custom needs, it will prompt you
       (see  ``Non-interactive  Mode''  and ``Interactive Mode,''
       below).

       Use pkgadd to install &gemini; packages which were created
       using the packaging format provided beginning with
        System V Release 4 [see and

       Products  are  made  up of one or more packages.  In turn,
       packages are made up of one or more files.   You  can  use
       custom  to  install  or  remove one or more packages for a
       product or list all the packages in a product.   In  addi-
       tion,  you  can  list  the files in a package or install a
       single file from a package.  By default, custom expects to
       install packages from floppy drive 0 (/dev/install).

       If you haven't installed a product before, you can provide
       the names of the packages to install  from  that  product.
       If  you want to install all the packages from the product,
       use ALL, instead of naming packages.  If you don't provide
       a  package  argument, custom will prompt you for the names
       of the packages you wish  to  install.   If  you  want  to
       install an additional package from a product that you pre-
       viously installed, follow the -s option  with  the  exist-
       ing_product name and follow the -i option with the package
       name(s).  existing_product can be a product id or a  prod-
       uct  name.   If  you don't provide these arguments, custom
       will prompt you for them.   Install  the  specified  pack-
       age(s)  Remove  the specified package(s) List the files in
       the  specified  package(s)  Install  the  specified   file
       Install  from  device /dev/install for floppy drive 0 (the
       default) or /dev/install1 for floppy drive 1

       If you invoke custom with no arguments, custom provides  a
       menu  of  the existing_products, beginning with the choice
       of adding a new product.  Select this first choice,  ``Add

                                                                1

       a  Supported  Product,''  if  you want to install packages
       from a new product whose distribution medium is in  floppy
       drive 0.  If you want to install, remove, or list packages
       from an existing_product, select the number  corresponding
       to  that existing_product.  If you choose to install pack-
       ages from existing_product, its distribution  medium  must
       be in floppy drive 0.

       Once  you  have  made your selection from this first menu,
       you will be offered the following menu:

       Install one or more packages Remove one or  more  packages
       List  the  available  packages List the files in a package
       Install a single file Select a new  product  to  customize
       Display current disk usage Help

       When you enter a menu option, you are prompted for further
       information.  Options 1, 2, and 3 list available  packages
       in  the selected product.  Each line describes the package
       name;  whether  the  package  is  fully   installed,   not
       installed  or partially installed; the size of the package
       (in 512-byte blocks); and a one line  description  of  the
       package contents.

       The  following  describes  what  actions are necessary for
       each menu option:

       After listing the packages available in  a  product,  this
       option  prompts for one or more package names.  To specify
       multiple packages, separate the names by spaces.  It  cal-
       culates  which  installation  volumes (distribution media)
       are needed and then prompts for the  correct  volume  num-
       bers.

       After  listing  the  packages available in a product, this
       option prompts for one or more package  names  to  remove.
       To  specify  multiple  packages,  separate  the  names  by
       spaces.  It deletes the correct  files  in  the  specified
       package(s).

       all files in the specified package(s).

   55.. iinnssttaallll ffiillee
       This option prompts for the name of a file from the  prod-
       uct  and retrieves that file from the distribution medium.

                                                                2

       The filename should be a full  pathname  relative  to  the
       root directory ``/''.

       When  installing some applications, error messages such as
       ``bad gid'' or ``bad uid'' may be printed.  These messages
       occur  because  some older UNIX systems assign UID and GID
       numbers differently from &gemini; systems.  If  necessary,
       the  file and/or directory permissions can be altered with
       after installation.

       Some packages require that SCOMPAT=3.2 be set before  cus-
       tom is run [see the NOTICES section of however, some pack-
       age installation procedures may not allow this to occur.

       If a package installation  using  the  custom  command  is
       interrupted,  the  /etc/perms/pkgname file is not deleted.
       The package cannot  be  reinstalled  until  this  file  is
       removed.  Remove the /etc/perms/pkgname file before resum-
       ing the installation.
