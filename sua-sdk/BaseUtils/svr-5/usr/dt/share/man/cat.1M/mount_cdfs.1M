       The  mount  command  attaches  the  cdfs filesystem to the
       filesystem  hierarchy  at  the   location   specified   by
       mount_point, which must already exist and must be a direc-
       tory.  If mount_point already has contents  prior  to  the
       mount operation, the contents remain hidden until the cdfs
       filesystem is  unmounted.   The  generic_options  are  the
       options  supported  by  the generic mount command (see the
       generic command for information about these options).  The
       cdfs-specific  options affect the mode of operation of the
       CDROM and are used to set default values.

       The CDROM media may or may not have values set  for  items
       such  as  the  User ID (UID), Group ID (GID), permissions,
       etc.  If a value is not recorded on the CDROM,  a  default
       value  is  assigned by the software.  The default value is
       either taken from the /etc/conf/pack.d/cdfs/space.c  file,
       or  from  the  value  specified  with the -o option of the
       mount command.

       Once the media is mounted, a default  value  can  only  be
       changed  by  using  the  or commands, or by unmounting (or
       remounting) the media and specifying  the  desired  values
       using the -o option.

       Specify  the  cdfs  FSType.  If  -F  cdfs is not specified
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the  file system type.  This command executes faster if it
       is not required to autodetect file system types. If possi-
       ble,  specify the -F cdfs.  Mounts the filesystem as read-
       only.  This option or the -o ro option is required.  Spec-
       ifies  the cdfs-specific options in a comma-separated list
       of options from the list below.  The default  values  that
       are  set when the CDROM is mounted include suid, susp, and
       rrip,    and     the     values     defined     in     the
       /etc/conf/pack.d/cdfs/space.c file.

       The  following  are  the  cdfs_options  to  -o: Mounts the
       resource read-only.  This option  or  the  -r  option  are
       required.   Allows  or  disallows execution of Setuid pro-
       grams.  The default is suid.   Enables/disables  the  pro-
       cessing  of all System Use Sharing Protocol (SUSP) compli-
       ant extensions to the ISO-9660/High-Sierra  specification.
       The SUSP defines a mechanism for which the System Use Area
       of a Directory Record may be shared by  multiple  indepen-
       dent  organizations,  for  example, Rock Ridge Interchange
       Protocol (RRIP).  The nosusp flag prevents the  processing

                                                                1

mount_cdfs(1M)                                     mount_cdfs(1M)

       of  all SUSP-compliant extensions, even if recorded on the
       media.  Enables/disables the processing of  all  the  Rock
       Ridge   Interchange  Protocol  (RRIP)  extensions  to  the
       ISO-9660/High-Sierra specification.  The RRIP is  a  SUSP-
       compliant set of extensions that provide POSIX file seman-
       tics within the context of an  ISO-9660/High-Sierra  file-
       system.  The rrip flag requires that the susp flag also be
       set.  The norrip flag prevents the processing of all  RRIP
       extensions  even  if recorded on the media.  Disallows the
       processing of all extensions to  the  ISO-9660/High-Sierra
       specification  (SUSP and non-SUSP alike), even if recorded
       on  the  media.   Currently,  noextend  is  equivalent  to
       nosusp,  norrip.   However,  noextend will apply to future
       ISO-9660/High-Sierra extensions.  Defines the logical sec-
       tor  size  of the media, as defined by the ISO-9660 and/or
       the High Sierra specifications.   If  not  specified,  the
       system  will  automatically  determine  the logical sector
       size of the media.  The user need not specify this option.
       However,  if  specified,  the value must exactly match the
       media being mounted.  Defines the default UID to  be  used
       for  the  files  and/or directories that do not have a UID
       recorded on the CDROM.  owner is a numeric UID value or  a
       user name.  See the command for more information.  Defines
       the default GID to be used for the files  and/or  directo-
       ries  that do not have a GID recorded on the CDROM.  group
       is a numeric GID value or a group name.  See  the  command
       in  the X/Open CD-ROM Support Component Preliminary Speci-
       fication for more information.  Defines the  default  file
       permissions to be used for the files that do not have per-
       missions recorded on the CDROM.   The  value  mode  is  an
       absolute  value (a 4-digit octal), or symbolic value.  See
       the and commands.  Defines the default  directory  permis-
       sions to be used for the directories that do not have per-
       missions recorded on the CDROM.   The  value  mode  is  an
       absolute  value (a 4-digit octal), or symbolic value.  See
       the and commands.  Sets User ID  mappings.   The  UID  and
       user  names  associated  with  a  file or directory on the
       CDROM might not be valid on the host system.   The  uidmap
       function maps the CDROM UIDs to valid host system UIDs.

       Entries in filename are specified as the value recorded on
       the CDROM, colon (:), followed by the UID or user name  as
       found  in  the  user database.  Multiple entries are sepa-
       rated by new lines.

       For example, filename may contain  the  entries:  1500:418
       1006:stanley  The first entry maps the UID of 1500 (on the
       CDROM) to a UID of 418.  The second entry maps the UID  of
       1006  (on  the  CDROM) to the user named stanley.  See the
       command.

       The maximum number  of  mappings  allowed  is  defined  in
       sys/cdrom.h.   Sets  Group ID mappings.  The GID and group
       names associated with a file or  directory  on  the  CDROM

                                                                2

       might  not  be valid on the host system.  The gidmap func-
       tion maps the CDROM GIDs to valid host system GIDs.

       Entries in filename are specified as the value recorded on
       CDROM,  colon  (:),  followed  by the GID or group name as
       found in the group database.  Multiple entries  are  sepa-
       rated by new lines.  See the command.

       The  maximum  number  of  mappings  allowed  is defined in
       sys/cdrom.h.  Sets the filename conversion  mode  for  the
       ISO-9660/High-Sierra  file and directory names recorded on
       the CDROM.  The nmconv option lets  you  specify  how  the
       file  and directory names are seen by the user on the host
       system.  Non-ISO-9660 and non-High-Sierra  names  are  not
       converted.

       a is some combination of the following: Names are not con-
       verted; the names used are the ones recorded on the CDROM.
       Converts upper case letters to lower case.  Suppresses the
       version number and the separator (;).  See  the  page  for
       more information.  Defines how the directory's search per-
       missions (the execute bit) are to be determined.  b is one
       of the following: Search permission is granted only if the
       user has execute permissions (as recorded on the CDROM  or
       using  the  dperm option above).  See the command for more
       information.  Search permission is  granted  only  if  the
       user  has  read or execute permissions (as recorded on the
       CDROM or using the dperm option above).  See  the  command
       for more information.  Maps the CDROM major and minor num-
       bers assigned to device nodes to valid host  system  major
       and  minor numbers.  The value for filename is a file that
       contains one entry for  each  device  file  in  the  form:
       device_file_path   new_major   new_minor  Fields are sepa-
       rated by white space (tabs or spaces) and entries are sep-
       arated  by a new line.  Anything beyond the third field in
       a line is treated as a comment.  See the command for  more
       information.

       The  mount command exits with one of the following values:
       Successful completion.  The mount  point  or  device  file
       specified does not exist.  Device does not contain a CDROM
       filesystem.  Access is denied.  Only a privileged user can
       change  any  settings.  Too many user, group, or file map-
       pings.  The sys/cdrom.h header file  defines  the  maximum
       number  of mappings allowed.  (See the devmap, gidmap, and
       uidmap options.)  Parameter error.  Bad format in filename
       (used  when setting/resetting the UID, GID and major/minor
       numbers).  The filename specified with the  devmap  option
       is not a device file.
