       The  mountall  command  mounts  filesystems according to a
       file_system_table.  If no file_system_table is  specified,
       then the file /etc/dfs/dfstab is used.

       Before  each filesystem is mounted, a sanity check is done
       using fsck (see
        to see if it appears mountable.  If the  filesystem  does
       not  appear mountable, it is fixed, using fsck, before the
       mount is attempted.

       The  umountall  command  causes  all  mounted  filesystems
       except root, /proc, /stand, and /dev/fd to be unmounted.

       The  mountall  and  umountall  commands take the following
       options: Specify the filesystem  type  to  be  mounted  or
       unmounted.   If  FSType is specified the action is limited
       to filesystems of this FSType.  Limit the action to  local
       filesystems.  Limit the action to remote filesystem types.
       Send a SIGKILL signal to processes that have files opened.
       The  mountall  and umountall commands may be executed by a
       privileged user only.

       With no arguments mountall restricts the mount to all sys-
       tems  with  automnt  field  set  to  yes  in the file_sys-
       tem_table.

       If the FSType is specified, mountall and  umountall  limit
       their actions to the FSType specified.

       No  messages  are printed if the filesystems are mountable
       and clean.
