       setclk  is  used  to set the internal system time from the
       hardware time-of-day clock.  The command can be used  only
       by a privileged user.  It is normally executed by an entry
       in the /etc/inittab file when the system is initialized at
       boot time.  Note that setclk checks the Nonvolatile Random

       set, setclk runs silently.  If the date is not set, setclk
       prompts the user to use
