       mount  attaches a sfs filesystem to the filesystem hierar-
       chy at  the  pathname  location  mount_point,  which  must
       already  exist.   If mount_point has any contents prior to
       the  mount  operation,  these  remain  hidden  until   the
       filesystem is once again unmounted.

       Specify the sfs FSType. If -F sfs is not specified heuris-
       tics similiar to those used by are used to  determine  the
       file  system  type.  This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify  the  -F  sfs.   Mount  the  filesystem read-only.
       Specify  sfs  filesystem  specific  options.   If  invalid
       options  are  specified,  a warning message is printed and
       the invalid options are ignored.  Multiple filesystem-spe-
       cific options may be listed in any order, but must be sep-
       arated by commas.  The following  options  are  available:
       Fake  an  /etc/mnttab entry, but do not actually mount any
       filesystems.  Parameters  are  not  verified.   Mount  the
       filesystem   without   making  an  entry  in  /etc/mnttab.
       Read/write or read-only.  Default is rw.  By  default  the
       filesystem  is  mounted  with  setuid  execution  allowed.
       Specifying nosuid overrides the  default  and  causes  the
       filesystem to be mounted with setuid execution disallowed.

       Note that mounting an unprotected medium (such as a floppy
       disk)  introduces  possible security risks.  While the use
       of nosuid protects against some  risks,  it  is  not  com-
       pletely effective.  The best defense against such security
       risks is to avoid mounting  unprotected  media.   Used  in
       conjunction  with  rw.  A filesystem mounted read-only can
       be remounted read-write.  Fails if the filesystem  is  not
       currently  mounted  or  if  the  filesystem is mounted rw.
       Specifies that writes need not  be  written  out  to  disk
       until  the  filesystem  is  about  to  be unmounted.  This
       volatility can improve system throughput as much as  eight
       percent  when the temporary directories (for example, /tmp
       and /var/tmp) are mounted this way.

       tory to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top
       of the symbolic link itself.
