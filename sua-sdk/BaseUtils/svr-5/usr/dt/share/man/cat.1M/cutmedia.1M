       The  cutmedia script provides the mechanism by which soft-
       ware publishers can create  floppy  diskettes  and  tapes.
       Invoked  without  arguments,  it  interactively allows the
       publisher to select media type, transfer one or more pack-
       ages  to the selected media, and transfer one or more sets
       to the selected media.

       You may exit the cutmedia script at any point.  Additional
       packages and sets can be incorporated, as long as they are
       in a standard location, and have  cutmedia  recognize  and
       prompt  for  these  packages  without having to modify the
       cutmedia script.

       cutmedia supports the following option:  Allows  the  pub-
       lisher  to  specify  the  type of media to be created. The
       argument to -d matches an  entry  in  the  /etc/device.tab
       file  on the host machine. The cutmedia script will accept
       the name of one or more sets and/or packages  to  be  cre-
       ated.  If  the -d option is not specified, the script will
       prompt for media type.
