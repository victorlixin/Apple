       HP-UX's  software distributor, SD-UX, is included with the
       HP-UX Operating System and manages software on  the  local
       host  only.  To install and manage software simultaneously
       on multiple remote hosts (including HP-UX, other (R) plat-
       forms,  Windows NT(R), and PCs) from a central controller,
       you must purchase the HP  OpenView  Software  Distributor,
       which  provides extended software management capabilities.

       the  command  without any command line options, or use the
       -i option.

       The command line versions of swinstall and swconfig can be
       interactive if the ask option is set to true.  The follow-
       ing information applies to HP OpenView Software  Distribu-
       tor only.

       To  invoke  the  HP OpenView Software Distributor GUI, use
       the sd command.  This  provides  the  central  interactive
       interface for creating and monitoring software jobs.

       All of the commands except swask, swpackage, and swmodify,
       use a distributed model of operation. The commands act  as
       a controller for distributed operations, managing the spe-
       cific software management tasks. For  each  target  selec-
       tion,  an  &sdpeter; agent process performs the task: Per-
       forms  software  management  tasks  as  the  agent  of  an
       &sdpeter; command.

       Communication  between  the  command  and each agent, plus
       other  target  host  activities  are  facilitated  by   an
       &sdpeter;  daemon process: Serves local or remote software
       management tasks.  The following  PC  information  applies
       only to HP OpenView Software Distributor.

       For  each PC controller target selection, a single Windows
       application combines the swagent and swagentd  functional-
       ity:  Performs  software management tasks, serves local PC
       software for distribution.

       Each PC running SWAGENTD.EXE is a PC controller. When dis-
       tributing  PC  software,  it acts as a fanout server to PC
       targets.  These targets run &sdpeter; PC agent programs to
       perform the actual software installation tasks.

       The  following paragraph applies only to HP OpenView Soft-
       ware Distributor.

       Most  &sdpeter;  commands  create  job  information   that
       records the job definition (in a session file), status and
       log information for the job.  Jobs can be executed immedi-
       ately,  or  scheduled  for  later execution.  The user can
       browse the scheduled, active,  and  completed  jobs  using
       either the command line, or interactive interfaces.

       &sdpeter;  uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to authorize a
       user attempting to create, modify, or read software  prod-

       access  permissions  to  a  target  host,  a target depot,
       and/or a target root filesystem.

       Because files are loaded and  scripts  are  run  as  root,
       granting  write permission (to install software) on a root
       filesystem, or insert permission (to create a new root) on
       a host, effectively gives the user root privileges.

       &sdpeter; uses a method based on credentials and passwords
       to authenticate the user and the  &sdpeter;  command  per-
       forming a given operation.

       Many policies and behaviors for the &sdpeter; commands can
       be controlled via the appropriate command options. Options
       can be defined in an &sdpeter; defaults file, specified on
       the command line invocation of a command, or specified  in
       the GUI.

       All commands, except swlist and swjob, log major events on
       the controller host, and detailed  events  on  the  target
       hosts.

       If  both  source  and  target machine are updated to HP-UX
       version 10.30 or later, the system  administrator  at  the
       source depot machine can track which user pulls what soft-
       ware (and when) from a depot on the source machine.  Refer
       to  the  source_depot_audit  option  for more information.
       The following paragraph applies only to HP OpenView  Soft-
       ware Distributor.

       You  can  use the &sdpeter; interactive interface (invoked
       using sd) and the command line interface  to  monitor  job
       progress  and  to  view  controller  and target log files.
       swconfig,  swcopy,  swinstall,  swmodify,  swpackage,  and
       swremove  support  a preview mode, where the commands will
       proceed through the Analysis phase, then exit.

       The preview mode only applies  to  non-interactive  opera-
       tions,  since  the GUIs wait for confirmation after analy-
       sis. In the interactive mode, you can resolve invalid con-
       ditions  that  the  commands  discover,  before they begin
       loading or removing files.

       Software products are organized in a  multi-level  hierar-
       chy:  bundles,  products,  subproducts, and filesets.  The
       actual files that make up  a  product  are  packaged  into
       filesets.   The  software selections for an &sdpeter; com-
       mand can specify bundles,  products,  individual  subprod-
       ucts, and/or individual filesets.

                                                                3

       Software products specify what machine types and operating
       systems they support.  swconfig, swinstall,  and  swverify
       can  detect and/or enforce the use of compatible software.

       swask, swconfig, swcopy, swinstall, swremove, and swverify
       support  dependencies  between filesets and other filesets
       and products.

       If a software selection specifies a  dependency  on  other
       filesets  and/or products, the commands will automatically
       select that software.  An exception is swremove, which can
       automatically  select  dependent software (filesets and/or
       products that depend on the software selections).

       By default, all dependencies must  be  resolved  before  a
       command  will  proceed.  The user can override this policy
       using the enforce_dependencies option.

       &sdpeter; supports two types of dependencies:  These  must
       be  installed  and configured before the dependent fileset
       is installed and configured (respectively).  These must be
       installed and configured before the dependent is usable.

       swinstall  can  install a software product to an alternate
       product location, instead of the default product directory
       specified  by  the vendor. (This directory location is the
       root directory of all the product's files.)

       swinstall can also install multiple versions of a software
       product  on a single target system, each in a unique prod-
       uct location.

       swconfig, swlist, swremove, and swverify allow a  user  to
       select a specific product from the multiple installed ver-
       sions, by specifying the product location as part  of  the
       software selection.

       By  default,  swinstall,  swlist,  swverify,  and swremove
       operate on the primary root filesystem,  /,  of  a  target
       host.   The  user  can specify an alternate root directory
       for these commands, meaning a directory other than /  that
       will eventually be the root of some target host (for exam-
       ple, building a test system by mounting its root  filesys-
       tem).  swconfig only operates on software installed to the
       primary root filesystem, /.  When operating  on  a  depot,
       swpackage,  swcopy,  swlist, swverify and swremove use the
       depot located at /var/spool/sw, by default.  The user  can
       also  specify  an alternate depot directory for these com-
       mands.

                                                                4

       swcopy, swinstall and swpackage perform a disk space anal-
       ysis  on  the target selections to ensure that enough free
       disk space is available to perform the task.

       Before performing any disk space analysis, these  commands
       (and  also  swverify  and  swremove)  execute to mount all
       filesystems  listed  in  each  target's  filesystem  table
       (/etc/fstab  or  equivalent).  This ensures that files are
       not loaded into a directory below a  future  mount  point.
       The  user  can  override  this  mounting  policy using the
       mount_all_filesystems option.

   CCoonnttrrooll ssccrriippttss
       swask, swconfig, swinstall, swremove and swverify  execute
       vendor-defined  control  scripts  to perform checks and/or
       other tasks beyond those explicitly performed by the  com-
       mands.

       swask,  swinstall, and swconfig can run request scripts to
       request user responses.

       For swinstall and swremove, a fileset and/or  product  can
       include a check script to perform an analysis of each tar-
       get selection (target host).  If this analysis fails,  the
       script   can   prevent   the  fileset/product  from  being
       installed/removed, or abort the entire session.

       In addition, swinstall and swremove  can  execute  scripts
       immediately  before and after the fileset/product has been
       installed or removed.  These scripts usually perform addi-
       tional file install or remove operations.

       swconfig, swinstall and swremove will also execute config-
       uration and unconfiguration scripts on an installed  file-
       set/product to configure or unconfigure the system for the
       software.

       swverify will execute a verification script which can ana-
       lyze  the  configured fileset/product to verify that it is
       configured properly.

       The &sdpeter; commands transition  products  and  filesets
       through a number of states.

       During  installation, software is transitioned through the
       following states: non-existant, TRANSIENT,  INSTALLED  and
       CONFIGURED.   During  removal,  software  is  transitioned
       through: CONFIGURED, INSTALLED,  TRANSIENT  and  non-exis-
       tant.

       When packaging or copying software into a depot, the soft-
       ware is transitioned through the  following  states:  non-

       existant,  TRANSIENT and AVAILABLE. When removing software
       from a depot, the software is transitioned through: AVAIL-
       ABLE, TRANSIENT and non-existant.

       If  a  task fails during any TRANSIENT state, the state is
       set to CORRUPT.

       Each invocation of an &sdpeter;  command  defines  a  task
       session.    Most  &sdpeter;  commands  automatically  save
       options, source information, software selections, and tar-
       get  selections before the task commences.  You can build,
       save, and reuse additional sessions with most commands.

       The  following options are supported by one or more of the
       &sdpeter; commands. Refer to  the  manual  pages  for  the
       available  options.   The  interactive  commands support a
       subset of the standard X Toolkit options  to  control  the
       appearance of the GUI.  The supported options are:
       -bg        -background
       -fg        -foreground
       -display   -name
       -xrm       -synchronous

       (Optional.) Causes the command to operate on target selec-
       tions  that  are alternate root directories (root filesys-
       tems other than /).

       Note that you cannot use this option to relocate  software
       during installation. You must use the l=location syntax in
       the software selection component.   Runs  the  command  in

       Runs the command in linkinstall mode, which makes software
       installed  under  a  server's  shared  root available to a
       diskless client's private root.

       When run  in  linkinstall  mode,  swinstall:  Creates  NFS
       mounts to the software to make it accessible from the tar-

       Mounts  are  created  by  examining the share_link product
       attribute.  Not all products  support  linkinstall.   Some
       products  may  be  visible without creating a new mount if
       they reside under an existing one.  Previews the  task  by
       executing  the  session  through  the  Analysis phase, and

       operands  (given  by target_selections).  Sets the session
       option to value, and overrides the  default  value  (or  a
       value  in  an  alternate option_file specified with the -X
       option).  Multiple -x options can be specified.  Reads the
       session  options  and  behaviors  from option_file.  These
       values override the default values.

   OOppeerraannddss
       Most &sdpeter; commands support  two  types  of  operands:
       software selections target selections

       These operands are separated by the @ character.

   SSooffttwwaarree sseelleeccttiioonnss
       The selections operands consist of software selections for
       most &sdpeter; commands.  For the swjob HP OpenView  Soft-
       ware Distributor and swreg commands, the selections can be
       job IDs, roots, or depots respectively.

       The &sdpeter; commands support the  following  syntax  for
       each    software    selection:   bundle[.product[.subprod-
       uct][.fileset]][,version]      product[.subproduct][.file-
       set][,version]  The version component has the form: [,r op
       revision][,a  op  arch][,v  op  vendor]   [,c   op   cate-
       gory][,l=location][,fr  op revision] [,fa op arch] Applies
       only to installed software that is installed to a location
       other  than  the default product directory.  Apply only to
       filesets.  The relational operator can be one of the  fol-
       lowing:  ==, >=, <=, <, > or !=.  These perform individual
       comparisons on dot-separated fields.

       For example, r>=B.10.00 chooses all revisions greater than
       or  equal  to B.10.00.  The system compares each dot-sepa-
       rated field to  find  matches.   Shell  patterns  are  not
       allowed with these operators.  The equals relational oper-
       ator lets you specify selections  for  swlist,  swpackage,
       and  swmodify with the shell wildcard and pattern-matching
       notations: [], *, ? and !.

       For example, r=1[01].* returns any revision in version  10
       or  version  11.   All  version  components are repeatable
       within  a  single  specification.   For   example,r>=A.12,
       r<A.20.   If  multiple  components are used, the selection
       must match all components.

       Fully-qualified software specifications include the r=  ,,
       a= , and v= version components, even if they contain empty
       strings.

       The software instance_id can take the place of the version
       component.  It  has the form [instance_id] within the con-
       text of an  exported  catalog,  where  instance_id  is  an

                                                                8

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       integer  that  distinguishes versions of products and bun-
       dles with the same tag.

       No space or tab  characters  are  allowed  in  a  software
       selection.

       The  \* software specification selects all products in the
       depot when used with -l product.   software  specification
       selects  all  products.  It  is  not allowed when removing
       software from the root directory, /.

   TTaarrggeett sseelleeccttiioonnss
       The &sdpeter; commands support the  following  format  for
       each  target  selection:  [host][:][/directory]  The  : is
       required if both a host and directory are specified.   The
       following PC information applies only to HP OpenView Soft-
       ware Distributor.

       swinstall and swjob support the following format for spec-
       ifying  PCs:  [pc_controller][::][pc_target]  The  PC con-
       troller is a fanout server.  The PC target  may  be  a  PC
       machine,  user or group name.  Valid targets for a PC con-
       troller can be listed using: swlist -l machine  |  user  |
       group PC targets can be further qualified for whether they
       refer to a PC machine, user or group type, with  the  fol-
       lowing  syntax:  name[,t=type][,k=address]  type  must  be
       specified when a name  applies  to  more  than  one  of  a
       machine,  user, or group.  (address is used internally for
       machines and is generally not needed on the command line.)
       The keyword * can be substituted for pc_target, specifying
       an installation to all target machines: @ pc_controller::*

       In  addition  to  the  standard options, several &sdpeter;
       behaviors and policy options can be changed  by  modifying
       the  default values found in: the system-wide default val-
       ues the user-specific default values

       Values must be specified in the defaults file as  follows:
       [command.]option=value The optional command prefix denotes
       one of the &sdpeter; commands. Using the prefix limits the
       change  in  the default value to the specified command. If
       the prefix is ommitted, the change  applies  to  all  com-
       mands.

       You  can  also  override default values using the -x or -X
       options: command -x option=value command -X option_file

       The following section lists all of the keywords  supported
       by  the  &sdpeter;  commands.   The keywords that are sup-
       ported for individual commands are  also  listed  on  each
       command's  manual  page.  If a default value exists, it is

                                                                9

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       listed in brackets. The commands that this option  applies
       to  are also specified.  The location of the agent program
       invoked by the daemon.

       Applies to swagentd.  Causes the target agent to automati-
       cally exit after Execute phase, or after a failed Analysis
       phase. This is forced to  false  when  the  controller  is
       using  an interactive user interface, or when the -p (pre-
       view) option is used. This  enhances  network  reliability
       and  performance.   If set to true' the target agent auto-
       matically exits when appropriate.  If set  to  false,  the
       target  agent  will not exit until the controller ends the
       session.

       Applies to swconfig, swcopy, swinstall,  swremove,  swver-
       ify.   Causes  a target agent to exit if it has been inac-
       tive for the specified time. This can be used to make tar-
       get  agents  more  quickly detect lost network connections
       since RPC can take as long as 130 minutes to detect a lost
       connection. The recommended value is the longest period of
       inactivity expected in your environment. For command  line
       invocation,  a  value between 10 minutes and 60 minutes is
       suitable. A value of 60 minutes  or  more  is  recommended
       when  the  GUI  will  be  used.  (The  default of 10000 is
       slightly less than 7 days.)

       Applies to swcopy,  swinstall,  swjob,  swlist,  swremove,
       swverify.   Prevents the installation of an older revision
       of a fileset that already exists  at  the  targets.  (Many
       software  products  do  not support downdating.) If set to
       true, the older revision can be installed.

       Applies to swinstall.  Requires that the software products
       which  are  being installed are compatible with the target
       selections. (All of the target selections must  match  the
       list  of supported systems defined for each selected prod-
       uct.)  If  set  to  true,  target  compatibility  is   not
       enforced.

       Applies  to  swconfig,  swinstall, and swverify.  Prevents
       the installation or configuration of another,  independent
       version  of  a product when a version is already installed
       or configured at the target.

       If set to true, another version of an existing product can
       be  installed into a new location, or can be configured in
       its new location. Multiple versions can only be  installed
       if  a  product  is locatable. Multiple configured versions
       will not work unless the product supports it.

       Applies to swconfig, swinstall, and swverify.  Defines the
       alternate  source  which  the  agent  will  use  when  the
       use_alternate_source option is set to true.  The alternate
       source  is  specified  as  follows: [host][:][path] If the

                                                               10

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       host is not specified, then the local host is used. If the
       path  is  not specified, then the path sent by the command
       is used.  The protocol sequence and endpoint given by  the
       option  swagent.rpc_binding_info  are  used when the agent
       attempts to contact an alternate source depot.

       Applies to swagent.  Executes a request script, which asks
       for a user response. If ask is set to as_needed, swinstall
       executes the request script only if a response  file  does
       not  already  exist in the control directory. See for more
       information on request scripts.

       Applies to swask, swconfig, and swinstall.

       The default for swask is true.  The default  for  swconfig
       and  swinstall  is  false.   Specifies  whether the kernel
       should be rebuilt after removing a kernel fileset.  If the
       kernel rebuild succeeds, the system automatically reboots.
       If set to false, the system continues to run  the  current
       kernel.

       If  set to true, the autoreboot option must also be set to
       true.  If set to false, the value of the autoreboot option
       does not matter.

       Applies  to  swremove  only.  Prevents the installation or
       removal of software that requires a reboot from  the  non-
       interactive  interface.  If  set  to true, software can be
       installed or removed, after which the target systems  will
       automatically reboot.

       An interactive session always asks for confirmation before
       software requiring a reboot is installed or removed.

       If the  auto_kernel_build  option  is  set  to  true,  the
       autoreboot  option  must  also  be  set  to  true.  If the
       auto_kernel_build option is set to false, the value of the
       autoreboot option does not matter.

       Applies  to  swinstall  and swremove.  Causes swinstall to
       remove the original files as  they  are  updated.   If  an
       error occurs during the installation (for example, network
       failure), then  the  original  files  are  lost,  and  the
       installation must be retried.

       If set to true, all files are saved as backup copies until
       all filesets in the current product loading are  complete,
       then they are removed. At the cost of a temporary increase
       in disk space and  slower  performance,  this  allows  for
       automatic  recovery of the original filesets in that prod-
       uct if the load fails.

       Applies only to swinstall.  This option applies only to HP
       OpenView Software Distributor.

                                                               11

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       Controls  automatic  job removal of completed jobs. If the
       job is automatically removed, job information (job  status
       or target log files) cannot be queried with swjob.

       Install jobs to PCs can not be automatically removed. They
       should not be removed until the job completes  on  all  PC
       targets.  Controls the automatic selection of prerequisite
       and corequisite software that is not  explicitly  selected
       by  the  user.  If  set to true, the requisite software is
       automatically  selected  for  configuration.   If  set  to
       false,   requisite   software,  which  is  not  explicitly
       selected, is not automatically selected for configuration.

       Applies  to  swconfig,  swcopy,  swinstall,  and swverify.
       Controls the automatic  selection  of  dependent  software
       that is not explicitly selected by the user. (Dependent is
       the opposite of requisite.) A dependent fileset has estab-
       lished either a prerequisite or a corequisite on the file-
       set under discussion.  If set to true, dependent  software
       to  be  automatically  selected  for  the  operation.  The
       default, false causes dependent  software,  which  is  not
       explicitly  selected, to not be automatically selected for
       the operation.

       Applies to swconfig and swremove.   Automatically  selects
       the  latest  patches  (based  on  superseding and ancestor
       attributes) for a software object selected by the user for
       a  swinstall  or  swcopy  operation.  If set to false, the
       patches corresponding to the selected object will  not  be
       automatically selected.

       The  patch_filter  option  can be used in conjunction with
       autoselect_patches.

       Applies to swask, swinstall, and swcopy.  If set to  true,
       bundles  that  are sticky will be automatically installed,
       or copied, along with the software it is made up  of.   If
       set  to  false,  the software can be installed, or copied,
       without automatically including sticky bundles  that  con-
       tain it.

       For  swremove,  if  set  to  true,  any  bundle  with  the
       is_sticky attribute set to true is  removed  automatically
       when  the  last  of  its  contents  is removed.  If set to
       false,  the  sticky  bundles  will  not  be  automatically
       removed.

       Applies to swcopy, swinstall, and swremove.  Causes swver-
       ify to verify the time stamp, size and checksum attributes
       of files.  If set to false, these attributes are not veri-
       fied.

       Applies to swverify.  Causes swverify to verify the  mode,
       owner,  UID, group, and GID attributes of installed files.

                                                               12

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       If set to false, these attributes are not verified.

       Applies to swverify.  Causes swverify to verify  that  the
       prerequisite  and corequisite dependencies of the software
       selections are being met.  If set to false,  these  checks
       are not performed.

       Applies  to  swverify.   Causes  swverify to run the file-
       set/product verify scripts for installed software.  If set
       to false, these scripts are not executed.

       Applies  to swverify.  Causes swverify to not verify those
       files marked as volatile  (that  is,  those  that  can  be
       changed).  If set to true, volatile files are also checked
       (for installed software).

       Applies to swverify.   Provides  the  codeword  needed  to
       unlock protected HP CD-ROM software.

       Some  HP  software  products are shipped on CD-ROM as pro-
       tected products.  That is, they  cannot  be  installed  or
       copied  unless  a  codeword  and customer ID are provided.
       The codeword is found on the CD-ROM certificate which  you
       received  from  HP. You may use this default specification
       on the command line or the SD-UX Interactive  User  Inter-
       face to enter the codeword.

       This  keyword stores the codeword for future reference; it
       needs to be entered only once.  If a  new  HP  product  is
       purchased,  and  a  previous  codeword  has  already  been
       entered for that CD-ROM, just enter the  new  codeword  as
       usual   and  the  codewords  will  be  merged  internally.
       Defines  the  command  called  to  compress  files  before
       installing, copying or packaging.  If the compression_type
       option is not set to gzip or compress, this path  must  be
       changed.

       Applies  to  swpackage and swagent.  If set to true, files
       are compressed (if not already compressed), before  trans-
       fer  from  a  source.   This  will  enhance performance on
       slower networks for swcopy and swinstall, and will  result
       in  smaller depots for swcopy and swpackage (unless uncom-
       press_files is also set to true).

       Applies to swcopy, swinstall, and swpackage.  Defines  the
       default  compression  type  used by the agent when it com-
       presses files during  or  after  transmission.  If  uncom-
       press_files  is  set  to  false,  the  compression type is
       recorded for each file compressed,  so  that  the  correct
       uncompression  can be applied later during a swinstall, or
       a swcopy operation, with uncompress_files set to true. The
       command  specified by compress_cmd must produce files with
       the specified compression  type  (compression_type).   The
       command  specified  by  uncompress_cmd  must  be  able  to

                                                               13

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       process files of the specified  compression  type,  unless
       the  format is gzip, which is uncompressed by the internal
       uncompressor (funzip).

       Applies to swagent.  Defines  the  script  called  by  the
       agent to perform release-specific configure cleanup steps.

       Applies to swagent.  When adding or deleting control  file
       objects,  this  option  lists  the  tags  of those control
       files. There is no supplied default.   If  there  is  more
       than  one  tag,  they  must be separated by whitespace and
       surrounded by quotes.

       Applies to swmodify.  Specifies the location  of  a  depot
       which  the  controller uses to resolve selections. Setting
       this option can reduce network traffic  between  the  con-
       troller  and the target.  The location is specified in the
       following  format:  [host][:][path]  This  option  has  no
       effect  on  which  sources  the target uses and is ignored
       when used with an Interactive User Interface.

       Applies  to  swcopy,  swconfig,  swinstall,  swremove  and
       swverify.   If  creating a target depot, swpackage creates
       Access Control Lists (ACLs) for the new  depots,  and  all
       products  being packaged into it.  If set to false, and if
       the  user  is  root,  swpackage  does  not  create   ACLs.
       (swpackage never creates ACLs when software is packaged on
       to a distribution tape.)

       Applies to swpackage.  Causes the agent to create the tar-
       get  directory  if  it  does  not already exist. If set to
       false, a new target directory will not  be  created.  This
       option  can  prevent  the erroneous creation of new target
       depots.

       Applies  to  swcopy  and  swinstall.   This  number,  also
       printed  on  the  Software  Certificate, is used to unlock
       protected software and restrict its installation to a spe-
       cific  site  or  owner.  It  is  entered using the -x cus-
       tomer_id= option or by using the Interactive  User  Inter-
       face.  The customer ID can be used on any HP-UX 10.0X com-
       patible HP9000 system.  Causes swinstall to  automatically
       configure   the   software   selections   after  they  are
       installed.  When an alternate root directory is specified,
       swinstall  never  performs  the  configuration task, since
       only hosts using the software should  be  configured.   If
       set  to  true,  this  option  allows  configuration  to be
       deferred, even when the root directory is /.

       When installing a successive version of a product, it will
       not  be  configured  if another version is already config-
       ured.  swconfig must be run separately.

       Applies to swinstall.  Defines  the  default  distribution

                                                               14

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       directory  to  read as the source (when source_type is set
       to directory).  The -s option overrides this default.

       Applies to swcopy, swinstall, and swpackage.  Defines  the
       default  distribution  directory of the target depot.  The
       target_selections operand overrides this default.

       Applies to swacl,  swcopy,  swlist,  swmodify,  swpackage,
       swreg,  swremove, and swverify.  Defines the default loca-
       tion of the target tape device  file.   The  target_selec-
       tions operand overrides this default.

       Applies  to  swpackage.   Requires  that  all dependencies
       specified by the software selections be resolved either in
       the  specified  source,  or at the target selections them-
       selves.

       swconfig, swcopy and swinstall will not proceed unless the
       dependencies  have  also been selected or already exist at
       the target in the correct state (INSTALLED, CONFIGURED  or
       AVAILABLE).   This  prevents  unusable software from being
       installed on the system. It also ensures that depots  con-
       tain usable sets of software.

       For  swremove,  if a selected fileset has dependents (that
       is, other software depends on the fileset)  and  they  are
       not selected, do not remove the selected filesets.

       If  set  to false, dependencies will still be checked, but
       not enforced. Corequisite dependencies (if not  enforced),
       may keep the selected software from working properly. Pre-
       requisite dependencies (if not enforced),  may  cause  the
       installation or configuration to fail.

       Applies  to  swconfig,  swcopy,  swinstall,  swremove  and
       swverify.  Prevents a command  from  proceeding  past  the
       Analysis  phase  if  the  disk  space required exceeds the
       available free space of the impacted filesystems.  If  set
       to  false,  then  the  install, copy, or package operation
       will use the filesystem's  MINFREE  space,  and  may  fail
       because it reaches the filesystem's absolute limit.

       Applies  to  swcopy,  swinstall  and  swpackage.  Prevents
       swinstall from proceeding past the kernel build  phase  if
       the  kernel  build  processes fail.  If set to false, then
       the install operation will continue (without suspension if
       in  the interactive mode) despite failure or warnings from
       either the system preparation process or the kernel  build
       process.

       Applies  to  swinstall.  If a fileset/product checkinstall
       or checkremove script fails (that is,  returns  with  exit
       code  1),  none  of  the  filesets in that product will be
       installed or removed.  If set to  false,  the  install  or

                                                               15

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       remove  operation  will  proceed, even when a check script
       fails.

       Applies to swinstall and swremove.  When adding or  delet-
       ing file objects, this option lists the pathnames of those
       file objects. There is  no  supplied  default.   Pathnames
       must be separated by whitespace.

       Applies  to swmodify.  Do not follow symbolic links in the
       package source files, but include the  symbolic  links  in
       the  packaged products.  If set to true, swpackage follows
       symbolic links in the package source files,  and  includes
       the files they reference in the packaged products.

       Applies  to  swpackage.   This  option  applies only to HP
       OpenView Software Distributor.

       By default, the job information is removed from  the  cen-
       tral  controller  only after the successful removal of the
       job information stored on each of the targets.  If the job
       should be removed regardless of the success of the removal
       of job information from targets, set this option to  true.

       Applies to swjob.  This option applies to HP-UX 10.* only.

       This option applies only to the Interactive User Interface
       when no SD-OV license is in effect on diskless server sys-
       tems. It causes swremove to run in a single  target  mode,
       even  though a diskless server normally causes swremove to
       run in multi-target mode.   Do  not  include  each  source
       file's  revision attribute in the products being packaged.
       Because this operation is  time  consuming,  the  revision
       attributes  are  not included by default.  If set to true,
       swpackage executes and possibly (in that order) to try  to
       determine a file's revision attribute.

       Applies  to  swpackage.   Defines the script called by the
       agent to perform release-specific  install  cleanup  steps
       immediately  after  the  last  postinstall script has been
       run.  For an operating system update, this  script  should
       at   least   remove   commands  that  were  saved  by  the
       install_setup script. This script is  executed  after  all
       filesets  have  been  installed, just before the reboot to
       the new operating system.

       Applies to swagent.  Defines  the  script  called  by  the
       agent to perform release-specific install preparation. For
       an operating system update, this script  should  at  least
       copy commands needed for the checkinstall, preinstall, and
       postinstall scripts to a path where they can be  accessed,
       while the real commands are being updated.  This script is
       executed before any kernel filesets are loaded.

       Applies to  swagent.   This  option  applies  only  to  HP

                                                               16

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       OpenView Software Distributor.

       Defines the polling interval, in minutes, used by the dae-
       mon.  It specifies how often a  PC  install  job  will  be
       polled in order to cache the progress of remote targets on
       the controller.

       Applies to swinstall.  This  option  applies  only  to  HP
       OpenView Software Distributor.

       This  is  an ASCII string specifying a job title.  This is
       displayed along with the  job  ID  to  provide  additional
       identifying information about a job when swjob is invoked.

       Applies  to  swconfig,  swcopy,  swinstall,  swremove  and
       swverify.  Defines the script called by the agent for ker-
       nel building.

       Applies to swagent.  Defines  the  path  to  the  system's
       bootable kernel. This path is passed to the command speci-
       fied by kernel_build_cmd via the  SW_KERNEL_PATH  environ-
       ment variable.

       Applies to swagent.  Specifies the POSIX layout version to
       which the &sdpeter; commands conform when writing  distri-
       butions  and  swlist  output. Supported values are 1.0 and
       0.8.  &sdpeter; for HP-UX version 10.10 and later can read
       or write either layout version.

       &sdpeter; object and attribute syntax conforms to the lay-
       out version 1.0 specification of  the  IEEE  POSIX  1387.2
       Software Administration standard. &sdpeter; commands still
       accept the keyword names associated with the older  layout
       version,  but  you  should  only use layout version 0.8 to
       create  distributions  readable  by  older   versions   of
       &sdpeter;.

       The  version used by swpackage can be controlled by speci-
       fying the layout_version attribute in the product specifi-
       cation   file   (PSF).   However,  if  the  layout_version
       attribute in the PSF is 1.0,  the  is_locatable  attribute
       defaults  to true in all cases, and must be explicitly set
       to false. (See for more information on PSFs.)

       Layout version 1.0 adds significant functionality not rec-
       ognized  by  systems supporting only 0.8, including: Cate-
       gory  class  objects  (formerly  the  category  and  cate-
       gory_title attributes within the bundle or product class).
       Patch-handling  attributes,   including   applied_patches,
       is_patch   and   patch_state.   The  fileset  architecture
       attribute, which permits you to specify  the  architecture
       of the target system on which the product will run.

       In  addition  to adding new attributes and objects, layout

                                                               17

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       version 1.0 changes the following preexisting 0.8  objects
       and    attributes   as   follows:   Replaces   the   depot
       media_sequence_number  of  the   media   object   with   a
       sequence_number attribute.  Replaces the vendor definition
       within products and bundles with  a  vendor_tag  attribute
       and  a  corresponding  vendor  object  defined outside the
       product or bundle.  Pluralizes the corequisite and prereq-
       uisite  fileset  attributes (to corequisites and prerequi-
       sites).  Changes the timestamp attribute of mod_time.

       Applies to swpackage, swcopy, swmodify and swlist.  Speci-
       fies a software level for swlist, swacl, or swreg.

       For swlist:

       Lists  all  objects down to the specified level.  Both the
       specified levels and the depth of the  specified  software
       selections  control  the  depth  of the swlist output. The
       supported software levels are: Shows all objects  down  to
       the  bundle  level.  Shows all objects down to the product
       level.  (-l bundle -l product also shows bundles.)   Shows
       all  objects  down  to  the  subproduct  level.  Shows all
       objects down to the fileset level.  (-l  fileset  -l  sub-
       product  also  shows subproducts.)  Showa all objects down
       to the file level (depots, products, filesets and  files).
       Shows all categories of available software objects.  Shows
       all applied patches.

       The supported depot and root levels are:  Shows  only  the
       depot  level (that is, depots which exist at the specified
       target hosts).  Lists all alternate roots.  Lists all reg-
       istered  shared roots (HP-UX 10.X only.)  Lists all regis-
       tered private roots (HP-UX 10.X only.)  The machine, user,
       and  group  levels apply only to HP OpenView Software Dis-
       tributor PC target files.  Shows the machines known  to  a
       PC  controller.  Shows the users known to a PC controller.
       Shows the groups known to a PC controller.

       For swacl, the level option defines the level of  ACLs  to
       view  or  modify: Views or modifies the ACL protecting the
       host systems identified by  target_selections.   Views  or
       modifies the ACL protecting the software depots identified
       by target_selections.  Views or modifies the ACL  protect-
       ing  the root filesystems identified by target_selections.
       Views or modifies the ACL protecting the software  product
       identified by software_selections.

       Applies only to products in depots, not installed products
       in roots.  Views or modifies the template's  ACL  used  to
       initialize  the ACLs of future products added to the soft-
       ware depots identified  by  target_selections.   Views  or
       modifies the template's ACL used to initialize the ACLs of
       future software depots or root filesystems, added  to  the
       hosts  identified by target_selections.  Views or modifies

                                                               18

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       the template's ACL used to  initialize  the  product  tem-
       plate's  ACLs of future software depots added to the hosts
       identified by target_selections.

       For swreg, the level option defines the level of object to
       register  or  unregister: Depots which exist at the speci-
       fied target hosts.  All alternate roots.   All  registered
       shared  roots  (HP-UX  10.X only.)  All registered private
       roots (HP-UX 10.X only.)

       Applies to swacl,  swlist  and  swreg.   Controls  whether
       numeric  identification  numbers are prepended to log file
       messages  produced  by  &sdpeter;:  No   identifiers   are
       attached to messages.  Applies to ERROR messages.  Applies
       to ERROR and WARNING messages.  Applies to ERROR, WARNING,
       and  NOTE  messages.  Applies to ERROR, WARNING, NOTE, and
       certain other messages.

       Applies to swconfig, swcopy,  swinstall,  swreg,  swremove
       and  swverify.   Controls  the amount of detail written to
       the log file.  If set to true, this option  adds  detailed
       task  information  (such  as  options  specified, progress
       statements, and additional summary information) to the log
       file.  This  information is in addition to log information
       controlled by the loglevel option.

       The  possible  combinations  of  loglevel  and   logdetail
       options are:
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       Log level  Log detail       Information included
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       loglevel=0                  No  information  is written to
                                   the log file.
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       loglevel=1 logdetail=false  Only key  events  are  logged.
       (Default.)                  (This is the default.)
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       loglevel=1 logdetail=true   Event  detail  as  above  plus
                                   task progress messages.
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       loglevel=2 logdetail=false  Event and file level  messages
                  (Default.)       only.
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       loglevel=2 logdetail=true   All   information  is  logged.
                                   This combination  may  produce
                                   the  same log file behavior as
                                   previous HP-UX 10.x  releases.
       Applies  to  swconfig, swcopy, swinstall, swreg, swremove,
       and swverify.  Defines  the  default  log  file  for  each
       &sdpeter;  command.   (The  agent  log  files  are  always
       located relative to the target depot or target  root,  for
       example,  /var/spool/sw/swagent.log  and  /var/adm/sw/swa-
       gent.log.)

                                                               19

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       Applies to all commands except swacl, swlist and swjob (HP
       OpenView  Software  Distributor).   Controls the log level
       for the events logged to the command,  the  target  agent,
       and  the source agent log files, by prepending identifica-
       tion numbers to &sdpeter; log file messages. This informa-
       tion is in addition to the detail controlled by the logde-
       tail option.

       A value of: provides no information.  enables verbose log-
       ging.  enables very verbose logging.

       Applies  to swconfig, swcopy, swinstall, swmodify, swpack-
       age, swremove and swverify.   If  set  to  true,  software
       selection  is done by locating filesets on the source that
       match the target system's installed filesets. If  multiple
       targets  are  specified,  the first in the list is used as
       the basis for selections.

       Applies to swinstall.  The maximum number of  agents  that
       are  permitted  to  run  simultaneously.   The value of -1
       means that there is no limit.

       Applies to swagentd.  If  creating  a  distribution  tape,
       this specifies the capacity of the tape in MB. This option
       is required if the media is not a DDS tape or a disk file,
       otherwise  swpackage sets the size to 1330MB for tape, and
       free space up to MINFREE for a disk file.

       Applies to swpackage.  Defines the type of distribution to
       create. The recognized types are: directory tape

       Applies  to  swpackage.   This  option  applies only to HP
       OpenView Software Distributor.

       Defines how often, in minutes, the daemon will wake up and
       scan the job queue to determine if any scheduled jobs need
       to be initiated or if  any  PC  install  jobs  need  their
       remote     target     status     cached    locally    (see
       job_polling_interval).  If set to  0,  no  scheduled  jobs
       will  be initiated, and no caching of PC install jobs will
       occur.

       Applies to swagentd.  By default, the  &sdpeter;  commands
       attempt to mount all filesystems in the /etc/fstab file at
       the beginning of the Analysis phase, to  ensure  that  all
       listed  filesystems  are  mounted before proceeding.  This
       policy helps to ensure that files are not  loaded  into  a
       directory that may be below a future mount point, and that
       the expected files are available for a  remove  or  verify
       operation.

       If set to false, the mount operation is not attempted, and
       no check of the current mounts is performed.

                                                               20

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       Applies  to  swconfig,  swcopy,  swinstall,  swremove  and
       swverify.   Defines  the  command  called  by the agent to
       mount all filesystems.

       Applies to swagent.  Defines the default objects to regis-
       ter  or  unregister.   There  is  no supplied default (see
       select_local above).  If there is more  than  one  object,
       they must be separated by spaces.

       Applies to swreg.  Defines the attributes which are listed
       in the non-verbose listing.

       Applies to swlist and HP OpenView  Software  Distributor's
       swjob.   This  option  can  be  used  in  conjunction with
       os_release to  specify  fileset  selection  for  an  HP-UX
       update.  os_name should only be specified from the command
       line. Refer to the &sdpeter; readme file for correct  syn-
       tax.  To  display  the  readme  file,  enter: swlist -d -a
       readme SW-DIST [@ host:/depot] Applies to swinstall.  This
       option  can be used in conjunction with os_name to specify
       fileset selection for an HP-UX update.  os_release  should
       only  be  specified  from  the  command line. Refer to the
       &sdpeter; readme file for correct syntax. To  display  the
       readme  file,  enter:  swlist  -d  -a  readme  SW-DIST  [@
       host:/depot]  Applies  to  swinstall.   If  set  to  true,
       swpackage  will  package  the specified products such that
       the target depot will not contain the files that make up a
       product.  Instead,  swpackage  inserts  references  to the
       original source files  used  to  build  a  product.   This
       behavior  allows products to be packaged without consuming
       the full disk space of copying all the source  files  into
       the target depot.

       Applies  to  swpackage.  Commits a patch by removing files
       saved for patch rollback. If set to  true,  and  run  with
       swmodify, you cannot roll back (remove) a patch unless you
       remove the associated base software that the  patch  modi-
       fied.

       Applies  to  swmodify.  Specifies a software specification
       for a patch filter.

       This option can be used in conjunction  with  the  autose-
       lect_patches  and patch_match_target options to filter the
       selected patches to meet the criteria specified  by  soft-
       ware_specification.

       Applies  to  swask,  swcopy and swinstall, If set to true,
       selects the latest patches  (software  identified  by  the
       is_patch  attribute)  that  correspond  to software on the
       target root or depot.

       The patch_filter option can be used  in  conjunction  with
       patch_match_target.

                                                               21

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       Applies to swcopy and swinstall.  Specifies the attributes
       displayed for each object listed when the -l patch  option
       is  invoked, and when no -a or -v option is specified. The
       default display attributes are title and patch_state.

       Applies to swlist and swjob.  Saves patched  files,  which
       permits  future  rollback  of  patches.  If  set to false,
       patches cannot be rolled back (removed)  unless  the  base
       software  modified  by  the  patch  is removed at the same
       time.

       Applies to swinstall.  This  option  applies  only  to  HP
       OpenView Software Distributor.

       The  status  information displayed for a PC install job is
       as recent as the last time the daemon polled  remote  tar-
       gets  for information (see the option job_polling_interval
       ).  If the most recent status is wanted, set  this  option
       to true.

       Applies to swjob.  Defines (in seconds) the polling inter-
       val used by interactive (GUI) sessions. It  specifies  how
       often  each  target  agent will be polled to obtain status
       information about the task being performed. When operating
       across  wide-area  networks,  the  polling interval can be
       increased to reduce network overhead.

       Applies to swcopy, swinstall and  swremove.   Defines  the
       command called by the agent to reboot the system.

       Applies to swagent.  Prevents software which is already in
       the CONFIGURED state from being reconfigured.  If  set  to
       true, CONFIGURED software can be reconfigured.

       Applies  to  swconfig.   Causes swcopy to register a newly
       created depot with the local swagentd daemon.  This action
       allows  other  &sdpeter;  commands  to automatically "see"
       this depot.  If set to false, a  new  depot  will  not  be
       automatically  registered.   (It  can  be registered later
       with swreg.)

       Applies to swcopy.  Causes swinstall to register  a  newly
       created  alternate  root  with  the local swagentd daemon.
       This action allows other &sdpeter; commands  to  automati-
       cally see this root.  If set to false, a new root will not
       be automatically registered.  (It can be registered  later
       with swreg.)

       Applies  to swinstall.  When re-installing (or re-copying)
       an existing version of a fileset, this option causes  that
       fileset  to be skipped, that is, not re-installed.  If set
       to true, the fileset will be re-installed (re-copied).

       Applies to swinstall and swcopy.  Causes all the files  in

                                                               22

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       a  fileset  to  always  be re-installed, re-copied, or re-
       packaged, even when the file already exists at the target,
       and  is identical to the new file.  If set to false, files
       that    have    the    same    checksum     (see     rein-
       stall_files_use_cksum),  size  and  time stamp will not be
       re-installed,  re-copied,  or  re-packaged.   This   check
       enhances performance on slow networks or slow disks.

       Applies  to  swinstall, swcopy and swpackage.  This option
       affects the operation when the reinstall_files  option  is
       set  to false.  It causes the checksums of the new and old
       files to be compared to determine if the new  file  should
       replace  the  old  one.  (The checksum is slower, but is a
       more robust way to check for file equivalence.)  If set to
       false, the checksums are not computed, and files are (not)
       reinstalled based only on their size and time stamp.

       Applies to swcopy, swinstall and swpackage.

       For swpackage, the default value for this option is false.
       Remove  an  empty  depot when the last product is removed.
       If set to false, an empty depot will not be removed,  pre-
       serving any depot's ACLs.

       Applies to swremove.  This option applies only to HP Open-
       View Software Distributor.

       When an install job to a PC is removed the software  asso-
       ciated  with that job is automatically removed from the PC
       depot.  If the software that is part of this  job  is  the
       same  software  being used by another job, then be sure to
       not delete the software as part of the  job  removal.   If
       the  software on the PC depot should be retained, set this
       option to false.

       Applies to swjob.  Controls whether  swcopy  automatically
       removes obsolete filesets from target products in the tar-
       get depot. If set to true, swcopy removes  obsolete  file-
       sets  from the target products that were written to during
       the copy process. Removal occurs after the  copy  is  com-
       plete.  Filesets  are defined as obsolete if they were not
       part of the most recent packaging of the product  residing
       on the source depot.

       Applies to swcopy.  Defines the script called by the agent
       to perform release-specific removal  preparation.  For  an
       operating  system  update,  this  script invokes the tlink
       command when a fileset is removed.

       Applies to swagentd.  Defines the number of times  a  lost
       source  connection  will be retried during file transfers.
       A lost connection is one that has timed out. When used  in
       conjunction  with  the  rpc_timeout option, the success of
       installing over slow or busy networks can be increased. If

                                                               23

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       set to zero, then any rpc_timeout value to the source will
       cause the task to abort. If set from  1  to  9,  then  the
       install  of  each fileset will be attempted that number of
       times.  The reinstall_files option should also be  set  to
       false  to  avoid  installing files within the fileset that
       were successfully installed.

       Applies to swcopy and  swinstall.   Defines  the  protocol
       sequences and endpoints on which the daemon listens and on
       which the other commands use to contact  the  daemon.   If
       the  connection  fails for one protocol sequence, the next
       is   attempted.    &sdpeter;   supports   both   the   TCP
       (ncacn_ip_tcp:[2121]) and UDP (ncadg_ip_udp:[2121]) proto-
       col sequence on most platforms.

       The values for swagentd can have the  following  forms:  A
       DCE  string  binding containing a protocol sequence and an
       endpoint. The syntax is: protocol_sequence:[endpoint]  The
       name  of  a  DCE protocol sequence with no endpoint speci-
       fied.  The  syntax  is:  protocol_sequence  For   example,
       ncadg_ip_udp  or  ncacn_ip_tcp.   (A  trailing  :  can  be
       attached to the protocol  sequence.  It  has  no  effect.)
       Since  no  endpoint  is specified, the DCE endpoint mapper
       rpcd must be running and will be used to find the endpoint
       registered  by  the  swagentd.  The value all.  This entry
       means to use (try) all protocol sequences supported by the
       DCE  RPC.   It  should be the only entry in the list.  The
       DCE endpoint mapper rpcd also must be running in order  to
       use this option.

       Applies to all commands except swask, swpackage and swmod-
       ify.  Defines the protocol sequences  and  endpoints  used
       when  the  agent  attempts  to contact an alternate source
       depot specified by  the  alternate_source  option.   HP-UX
       supports   both  the  UDP  (ncadg_ip_udp:[2121])  and  TCP
       (ncacn_ip_tcp:[2121]) protocol sequence/endpoint.  UDP  is
       used by default.

       Applies  to swagentd.  The relative length of the communi-
       cations timeout. This is a value in the range from 0 to  9
       and  is  interpreted  by  the DCE RPC.  Higher values mean
       longer times. You may need a higher value for  a  slow  or
       busy network. Lower values will give faster recognition on
       attempts to contact hosts that are not up, or are not run-
       ning  swagentd.  Each value is approximately twice as long
       as the preceding value.  A value of 5 is about 30  seconds
       for  the  ncadg_ip_udp protocol sequence.  This option may
       not have any noticeable impact when using the ncacn_ip_tcp
       protocol sequence.

       Applies to all commands except swpackage and swmodify.  If
       no target selections are specified,  selects  the  default
       target directory of the local host as the target selection
       for the command.

                                                               24

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       Applies to swacl,  swconfig,  swcopy,  swinstall,  swlist,
       swreg,  swremove  and swverify.  Defines the default soft-
       ware selections.  There is no supplied default.  If  there
       is  more  than  one software selection, they must be sepa-
       rated by spaces.  Software is usually specified in a soft-
       ware  input  file,  as operands on the command line, or in
       the GUI.

       Applies to all commands except swreg and HP OpenView Soft-
       ware  Distributor's swjob.  Indicates the software view to
       be used by the interactive interface of the  commands  and
       by swlist for the default listing level.  It can be set to
       products, all_bundles, or a bundle category tag (to  indi-
       cate to show only bundles of that category).

       Applies   to   swcopy,  swinstall,  swlist  and  swremove.
       Defines the default location of the source CD-ROM as  fol-
       lows:  host:path Applies to swinstall.  If both source and
       target machine are  updated  to  HP-UX  version  10.30  or
       later,  the  system  administrator  at  the  source  depot
       machine can set this option to track which user pulls what
       software  (and  when)  from a depot on the source machine.
       (Note that a user running swinstall or swcopy from a  tar-
       get machine cannot set this option; only the administrator
       of the source depot machine can set it.)

       If source_depot_audit is set to true, a  swaudit.log  file
       is  created  on  the  source depot (for writable directory
       depots) or in /var/tmp (for images, CD-ROMs, or other non-
       writable depots).

       Users  can  invoke  the  swlist interactive user interface
       (using swlist -i -d) to view, print,  or  save  the  audit
       information  on  a  remote  or local depot. Users can view
       audit information based on language preference, as long as
       the system has the corresponding &sdpeter; message catalog
       files on it. For example, a user can view the source audit
       information  in  Japanese during one invocation of swlist,
       then view the same information  in  English  at  the  next
       invocation.

       Applies  to  swagent,  swinstall  and swlist.  Defines the
       default location of the source product specification  file
       (PSF).  The  host:path syntax is not allowed: only a valid
       path can be  specified.   The  -s  option  overrides  this
       value.

       Applies  to  swpackage  and swmodify.  Defines the default
       location of the source tape, usually the character-special
       file  of  a  local tape device. If the host:path syntax is
       used, the host must match the local host.  The  -s  option
       overrides this value.

       Applies  to  swcopy  and  swinstall.   Defines the default

                                                               25

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       source type: cdrom, file, directory or tape.   The  source
       type derived from the -s option overrides this value.

       Applies  to  swcopy, swinstall and swpackage.  (The values
       of cdrom, and tape do not apply to swpackage.   The  value
       file  applies to swpackage only.)  Defines the path to the
       kernel's template file. This path is passed to the command
       specified  by  system_prep_cmd via the SW_SYSTEM_FILE_PATH
       environment variable.

       Applies to swagent.  Defines the kernel build  preparation
       script  called by the agent.  This script must do any nec-
       essary preparation so that control scripts  can  correctly
       configure  the  kernel  about  to be built. This script is
       called before any kernel filesets have been loaded.

       Applies to swagent.  Defines  the  default  target  selec-
       tions.   There  is  no  supplied default (see select_local
       above).  If there is more than one target selection,  they
       must  be  separated by spaces.  Targets are usually speci-
       fied in a target input file, as operands  on  the  command
       line, or in the GUI.

       Applies  to  all  commands.  Defines the command to uncom-
       press files when installing, copying or  packaging.   This
       command  processes files which were stored on the media in
       a compressed format. If  the  compression  type  (compres-
       sion_type)  of  the  file is gzip then the internal uncom-
       pression (funzip) is used instead of the external  command
       specified by uncompress_cmd.

       Applies  to  swpackage  and  swagent.   If the files being
       transferred from a source  are  compressed,  setting  this
       option  will  uncompress  the files before storing them on
       the target depot.

       Applies to swcopy and  swpackage.   Empowers  each  target
       agent to use its own, configured alternate source, instead
       of the one specified by the user.  If set to  false,  each
       target  agent  will use the same source, namely the source
       specified by the user and validated by  the  command.   If
       set  to  true,  each target agent will instead use its own
       configured value for the source.

       Applies to swcopy and swinstall.  Controls  the  verbosity
       of  a non-interactive command's output: disables output to
       stdout. (Error and warning messages are always written  to
       stderr.)   enables  verbose  messaging to stdout.  enables
       very verbose messaging to stdout (for swpackage and swmod-
       ify)

       For swlist, a verbose listing includes all attributes that
       have been defined for the appropriate level of each  soft-
       ware selection operand. The attributes are listed, one per

                                                               26

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       line, prefaced by the attribute keyword.

       The -v option overrides verbose (if set to 0).

       Applies to all commands.  Prevents the installation, copy-
       ing,  or  packaging of files to a target which exists on a
       remote (NFS) filesystem.  Also  prevents  the  removal  of
       files  from  a  remote filesystem.  All files destined for
       (or already on) a remote filesystem will be skipped.

       If set to true and if root has  write  permission  on  the
       remote  filesystem,  the remote files will not be skipped,
       but will be installed, copied, packaged or removed.

       Applies to swcopy, swinstall, swpackage and swremove.

       Each invocation of an &sdpeter;  command  defines  a  task
       session.   Most   &sdpeter;  commands  automatically  save
       options, source information, software selections, and tar-
       get  selections  before  the task actually commences. This
       lets you re-execute the command even if the  session  ends
       before  the  task  is  complete. You can also save session
       information from interactive or command line sessions.

       Session information is saved to  the  file  $HOME/.sw/ses-
       sions/command.last.   This  file  is  overwritten  by each
       invocation of the command. The file uses the  same  syntax
       as the defaults files.

       From an interactive session, you can save session informa-
       tion into a file at any time by selecting the Save Session
       or Save Session As option from the File menu.

       From a command line session, you can save session informa-
       tion by executing the command  with  the  -C  session_file
       option.  You  can  specify  an absolute path for a session
       file. If you do not specify a directory, the default loca-
       tion is $HOME/.sw/sessions/.

       To re-execute a saved session from an interactive session,
       use the Recall Session option from the File menu.

       To re-execute a session from a command line,  specify  the
       session file as the argument to the -S option.

       When you re-execute a session file, the values in the ses-
       sion file override values in  the  system  defaults  file.
       Also, any command line options and parameters override the
       values in the session file.

       Most &sdpeter; commands support software and target selec-
       tions  from  separate  input  files  (see  the  -f  and -t

                                                               27

       options).  Software and targets specified in  these  files
       will be selected for operation.

       Additionally,  commands that support an interactive inter-
       face read a list of possible hosts to operate on from  the
       values found in: the system-wide default list of hosts the
       user-specific default list of hosts

       Hosts in this file are not marked for operation, but  pro-
       vide  a default list from which to choose. For each inter-
       active command, target hosts containing roots,  containing
       depots,  and hosts serving as fanout servers are specified
       in   separate   lists   (hosts,   hosts_with_depots    and
       fanout_servers   respectively).  The  list  of  hosts  are
       enclosed in curly braces ({}) and separated by whitespace.
       For  example:  swinstall.hosts={hostA  hostB  hostC  hostD
       hostE hostF} swinstall.fanout_servers={pc1 pc2} (HP  Open-
       View          Software          Distributor          only)
       swcopy.hosts_with_depots={hostS}
       swcopy.fanout_servers={pc1 pc2} (HP OpenView Software Dis-
       tributor only)  swremove.hosts={hostA  hostB  hostC  hostD
       hostE   hostF}   swremove.hosts_with_depots={hostS}   Most
       &sdpeter; commands support patch  filtering  with  the  -x
       patch_filter=software_specification  option.  In addition,
       the interactive user  interface  commands,  swinstall  and
       swcopy read a list of possible patch filters. The user can
       use the values from this list for selection criteria.  The
       lists are stored in: the system-wide default list of patch
       filters the user-specific default list of patch filters

       Filters in this file are not marked for selection use, but
       provide a default list from which the user can choose. The
       list of patch filters is enclosed in curly brackets  ({}),
       and   separated   by   whitespace.    For  example:  swin-
       stall.patch_filter_choices={ *.*,c=enhancement *.*,c=crit-
       ical   }   swremove.patch_filter_choices={   Product.File-
       set,c=halts_system } The following PC information  applies
       to HP OpenView Software Distributor only.

       For installing to PCs, PC target lists are generated auto-
       matically by querying the PC file server associated with a
       PC  controller.   Any user, group, or machine known to the
       fileserver will be included in the default list from which
       to  choose.   Additionally, all machines known to the file
       server will by default be selected for  installation  when
       selecting a PC controller.

       &sdpeter;  programs  are  affected by external environment
       variables, set environment variables for use by  the  con-
       trol  scripts,  and  set  additional environment variables
       that affect scripts run by swinstall and swremove.

       Some  external  environment  variables  that  affect   the

                                                               28

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       &sdpeter; commands.  The LANG variable determines the lan-
       guage in which messages are displayed.   If  LANG  is  not
       specified,  or is set to the empty string, a default value
       of C is used.  See for more information.  The language  in
       which the &sdpeter; agent and daemon log messages are dis-
       played is set by the system configuration variable script,
       /etc/rc.config.d/LANG.  For example, /etc/rc.config.d/LANG
       must be set to LANG=ja_JP.SJIS or LANG=ja_JP.eucJP to make
       the  agent  and  daemon  log messages display in Japanese.
       This variable applies to  all  &sdpeter;  commands  except
       swgettools.

       Environment  variables  that  affect  scripts: Defines the
       current directory of the script being executed:  either  a
       temporary  catalog  directory,  or  a directory within the
       Installed Products Database (IPD).   This  variable  tells
       scripts  where  other control scripts for the software are
       located.  Defines the location of the product,  which  may
       have been changed from the default product directory. When
       combined  with  SW_ROOT_DIRECTORY,  this  variable   tells
       scripts  where  the  product files are located.  Defines a
       minimum set of commands available for  use  in  a  control
       script  (for  example,  /sbin:/usr/bin).  Defines the root
       directory in which the session is operating, either  /  or
       an alternative root directory. This variable tells control
       scripts the root  directory  in  which  the  products  are
       installed. A script must use this directory as a prefix to
       SW_LOCATION to locate the product's installed  files.  The
       configure  script is only run when SW_ROOT_DIRECTORY is /.
       Contains the pathname of a file containing  the  value  of
       every  option for a particular command, including software
       and target selections. This lets scripts retrieve any com-
       mand  options  and  values  other  than  the ones provided
       explicitly by other environment  variables.  For  example,
       when  the  file  pointed to by SW_SESSIONS_OPTIONS is made
       available to a request script, the targets option contains
       a list of software_collection_specs for all targets speci-
       fied for the command.

       When the file pointed to by  SW_SESSIONS_OPTIONS  is  made
       available  to  other  scripts, the targets option contains
       the single software_collection_spec  for  the  targets  on
       which  the  script  is  being executed.  This contains the
       fully qualified  software  specification  of  the  current
       product  or fileset. The software specification allows the
       product or fileset to be uniquely identified.

       Additional environment variables that affect  scripts  run
       by  swinstall  and swremove: This is normally unset. If it
       is set, the actions necessary  for  preparing  the  system
       file,  /stand/system,  cannot  be accomplished from within
       the postinstall scripts, but instead must be  accomplished
       by  the  configure scripts.  This occurs whenever software
       is installed to a directory other than /, such  as  for  a

                                                               29

       cluster  client system.  This variable should be read only
       by the configure and postinstall scripts of a kernel file-
       set.   swinstall  sets these environment variables for use
       by the kernel preparation and build scripts.  This is nor-
       mally unset. If set, the swinstall session is being run as
       the back end of an initial  system  software  installation
       (cold  install).  The path to the kernel. The default path
       is  /stand/vmunix,  defined  by  the  swagent  kernel_path
       options.   Indicates  whether  a kernel build is scheduled
       for the current install/remove session. If  set  to  true,
       the  selected  kernel  fileset  is  scheduled for a kernel
       build, and changes to /stand/system are required.  If  set
       to  NULL,  a kernel build is not scheduled, and changes to
       /stand/system are not required.

       The value of this variable is always equal to the value of
       SW_SESSION_IS_REBOOT.    Indicates  whether  a  reboot  is
       scheduled for a fileset selected for removal. Because  all
       HP-UX  kernel filesets are also reboot filesets, the value
       of this variable is always equal to the value  of  SW_SES-
       SION_IS_KERNEL.  The path to the kernel's system file. The
       default path is /stand/system.

       The &sdpeter; commands catch the SIGQUIT and  SIGINT  sig-
       nals.  If these signals are received, the command prints a
       message, sends a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to the agents
       to wrap up, and then exits.

       The  agent ignores SIGHUP, SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals.  It
       immediately exits gracefully after receiving the  SIGTERM,
       SIGUSR1  or  SIGUSR2  signal.  Killing the agent may leave
       corrupt software on the system, and thus  should  only  be
       done  if absolutely necessary. Note that when an &sdpeter;
       command is killed, the agent does not terminate until com-
       pleting the task in progress.

       The daemon ignores the SIGHUP, SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals.
       It immediately exits gracefully after receiving a  SIGTERM
       and SIGUSR2 signal.  After receiving SIGUSR1, it waits for
       completion of a copy or remove from a depot session before
       exiting,  so  that it can register or unregister depots if
       necessary. Requests to start new sessions are refused dur-
       ing this wait.

       &sdpeter;  commands  use  a  common  locking mechanism for
       reading and modifying both root directories  and  software
       depots.  This  mechanism  allows multiple readers but only
       one writer on a root or depot.

       The &sdpeter; commands which modify software in an (alter-
       nate) root directory are restricted from simultaneous mod-
       ification using locking on the  var/adm/sw/products/swlock

                                                               30

sd(1M)                                                     sd(1M)

       file,   relative  to  the  root  directory  (for  example,
       /var/adm/sw/products/swlock).

       The &sdpeter; commands which modify software  in  a  depot
       are  restricted from simultaneous modification using fcntl
       locking on the catalog/swlock file relative to  the  depot
       directory (for example, /var/spool/sw/catalog/swlock).

       All  commands  set  fcntl  read  locks on roots and depots
       using the swlock file mentioned above.  When a  read  lock
       is set, it prevents other &sdpeter; commands from perform-
       ing modifications (that is, from setting write locks).

       Each &sdpeter; command invocation returns: The swtask suc-
       cessfully  completed.   The  swtask  failed  on all target

       swconfig, swcopy, swinstall, swmodify, swpackage, swremove
       and swverify support a preview mode, where operation  will
       proceed  through  the  analysis  of each target selection,
       then exit before the actual task is performed.

       The HP OpenView Software Distributor interactive interface
       (invoked  using  and swjob can be used to view the current
       status of any job as well as the controller and target log
       files.

       Preview  is only applicable for non-interactive operation,
       since the interactive commands wait for confirmation after
       analysis. In the interactive mode, you can resolve invalid
       conditions that the commands discover  before  they  begin
       loading or removing files.

       When non-interactive, the commands write messages for sig-
       nificant events.  These events include: a  begin  and  end
       task  message a message for starting the task on each host
       a message for completing the task on each host

       When the verbose option is set, summary messages about the
       task are also sent to stdin.

       All  commands  log major events on the host where the com-
       mand was invoked.  They log detailed events to the swagent
       log  file associated with each target selection.  The com-

       option.)  A swagent process  performs  the  actual  swacl,
       swconfig,  swcopy, swinstall, swremove and swverify opera-
       tion at each target selection.  For operations  on  target
       root  objects,  swagent  logs  messages to var/adm/sw/swa-
       gent.log beneath the root directory (for example, / or  an
       alternate root directory).  For operations on target depot
       objects, swagent logs messages to swagent.log beneath  the
       depot directory (for example, /var/spool/sw).

       The  swagentd  daemon  running  on  a host, logs events to
       /var/adm/sw/swagentd.log.   If  both  source  and   target
       machine  are  updated to HP-UX version 10.30 or later, the
       system administrator at the source depot machine can track
       which  user pulls what software (and when) from a depot on
       the  source  machine.   Refer  to  the  source_depot_audit
