       generic_options  are options supported by the generic vol-
       copy command.

       volcopy makes a literal copy of the s5 filesystem using  a
       blocksize matched to the device.

       Specify  the  s5 FSType. If -F s5 is not specified heuris-
       tics similiar to those used by are used to  determine  the
       file  system  type.  This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify the -F s5.  Invoke a verification sequence requir-
       ing a positive operator response instead of  the  standard
       10-second  delay  before  the  copy is made.  Assume a yes
       response to all questions.

       Other options are used with  both  9-track  and  cartridge
       tapes (cartridge tapes are treated as if they were 9-track
       tapes.)  bits per inch size of reel in feet beginning reel
       number  for  a restarted copy use double buffered I/O pro-
       cess until the end of tape, then ask for the next tape  in
       sequence.

       If  the  -e  option  is not selected, the program requests
       length and density information if this is not given on the
       command  line,  or  if it is not recorded on an input tape
       label.  If the filesystem is too large to fit on one reel,
       volcopy prompts for additional reels.  Labels of all reels
       are checked.  Tapes may be mounted alternately on  two  or
       more  drives.   If  volcopy is interrupted, it asks if the
       user wants to quit or escape to the  command  interpreter.
       In  the latter case, the user can perform other operations
       (such as labelit) and return to  volcopy  by  exiting  the
       command  interpreter.   The -e and -feet options are mutu-
       ally  exclusive.   The  fsname  argument  represents   the
       mounted  name  (for  example,  root,  usr,  etc.)  of  the
       filesystem being copied.

       The srcdevice or destdevice should be the  disk  partition
       or tape. For example, /dev/rdsk/* or /dev/rmt/*, where the
       value of * is machine specific.

       The volname is the physical volume name.  Such label names
       contain up to six characters.  volname may be ``-'' to use
       the existing volume name.

       srcdevice and volname1 are  the  device  and  volume  from
       which  the  copy  of  the  filesystem  is being extracted.
       destdevice and volname2 are the target device and  volume.

                                                                1

       fsname and volname are recorded in the superblock.

       volcopy  does  not  support tape-to-tape copying.  Use for
       tape-to-tape copying.
