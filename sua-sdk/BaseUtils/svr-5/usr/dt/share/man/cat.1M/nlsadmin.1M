       nlsadmin  is  the  administrative  command for the network
       listener processes on a  machine.   Each  network  has  at
       least one instance of the network listener process associ-
       ated with it; each instance (and thus,  each  network)  is
       configured  separately.   The listener process ``listens''
       to the network for service requests, accepts requests when
       they arrive, and invokes servers in response to those ser-
       vice requests.

       nlsadmin may be used with the  following  combinations  of
       options  and  arguments:  Gives  a  brief  usage  message.
       Reports the  status  of  all  of  the  listener  processes
       installed  on this machine.  Prints the status of the lis-
       tener process for net_spec.  Queries  the  status  of  the
       listener  process  for the specified network, and reflects
       the result of that query in its exit code.  If a  listener
       process  is active, nlsadmin will exit with a status of 0;
       if no process is active, the exit code will be 1; the exit
       code  will  be  greater than 1 in case of error.  Prints a
       verbose report on the servers  associated  with  net_spec,
       giving  the service code, status, command, and comment for
       each.  It also specifies the uid the server will  run  as,
       the  authentication  scheme, and the list of modules to be
       pushed, if any, before the server is  started.   Prints  a
       report  on  the  server  associated with net_spec that has
       service code service_code, giving the same information  as
       in  the -v option.  Queries the status of the service with
       service code service_code on network net_spec,  and  exits
       with  a  status of 0 if that service is enabled, 1 if that
       service is disabled, and greater than 1 in case of  error.
       Changes  or  sets  the transport address on which the lis-
       tener  listens  (the  general  listener  service).    This
       address  can  be  used  by  remote processes to access the
       servers  available  through  this  listener  (see  the  -a
       option, below).

       If  address  is  just a dash (-), nlsadmin will report the
       address currently configured, instead of changing it.

       A change of address takes effect immediately.  Changes  or

                                                                1

       sets  the  address  on  which  the  listener  listens  for
       requests for terminal service but is otherwise similar  to
       the  -l  option  above.  A terminal service address should
       not be defined unless the appropriate remote  login  soft-
       ware  is  available.  The terminal service must be config-
       ured as service code 1 (see the -a option,  below).   Ini-
       tializes an instance of the listener for the network spec-
       ified by net_spec; that is, creates  and  initializes  the
       files  required  by  the listener as well as starting that
       instance of the listener.  Note that a particular instance
       of the listener should be initialized only once.  The lis-
       tener must be initialized before  assigning  addresses  or
       services.   Adds  a  new  service  to the list of services
       available through the indicated listener.  service_code is
       the code for the service, cmd is the command to be invoked
       in response to that service code, comprised  of  the  full
       path  name of the server and its arguments, and comment is
       a brief (free-form) description of the service for use  in
       various  reports.   Note  that cmd must appear as a single
       word to the shell; if arguments are required, the cmd  and
       its  arguments  must be enclosed in quotation marks.  com-
       ment must also appear as a single word to the shell.  When
       a  service  is  added, it is initially enabled (see the -e
       and -d options, below).  cmd and comment may contain  sup-
       plementary code set characters.

       Service  codes are alphanumeric strings.  The numeric ser-
       vice codes 0 through 100 are reserved for internal use  by
       the  listener.   Service  code  0  is assigned to the nlps
       server, which is the service invoked on the  general  lis-
       tening  address.  In particular, code 1 is assigned to the
       remote login service, which is the  service  automatically
       invoked for connections to the terminal login address.

       If the -p option is specified, then modules will be inter-
       preted as a list of STREAMS modules for  the  listener  to
       push before starting the service being added.  The modules
       are pushed in  the  order  they  are  specified.   modules
       should be a comma-separated list of modules, with no white
       space included.  modules must be specified in ASCII  char-
       acters.

       If the -w option is specified, then name is interpreted as
       the user name from /etc/passwd that  the  listener  should
       look  up.   From  the  user name, the listener obtains the
       user ID, the group IDs, and the home directory for use  by
       the server.  If -w is not specified, the default is to use
       the user name listen.

       A service must explicitly be added  to  the  listener  for
       each  network  on  which  that service is to be available.
       This operation will normally be performed  only  when  the
       service  is installed on a machine, or when populating the
       list of services for a new network.  Removes the entry for

                                                                2

       the  service_code  from  that listener's list of services.
       This is normally done only in conjunction with  the  dein-
       stallation  of  a service from a machine.  Enables or dis-
       ables (respectively) the service indicated by service_code
       for  the  specified  network.  The service must previously
       have been added to the listener for that network (see  the
       -a  option, above).  Disabling a service will cause subse-
       quent service requests for that service to be denied,  but
       the  processes  from  any  prior service requests that are
       still running will continue unaffected.  Starts and  kills
       (respectively) the listener process for the indicated net-
       work.  These operations will normally be performed as part
       of  the  system startup and shutdown procedures.  Before a
       listener can be started for a particular network, it  must
       first  have  been  initialized (see the -i option, above).
       When a listener is killed, processes that are  still  run-
       ning  as  a result of prior service requests will continue
       unaffected.

       Under the Service Access Facility, it is possible to  have
       multiple  instances  of the listener on a single net_spec.
       In any of the above commands, the option -N pmtag  may  be
       used  in  place  of  the net_spec argument.  This argument
       specifies the tag by which an instance of the listener  is
       identified  by  the  Service  Access  Facility.  If the -N
       option is not specified (that is, the net_spec  is  speci-
       fied  in the invocation), then it will be assumed that the
       last component of the net_spec represents the tag  of  the
       listener  for  which  the operation is destined.  In other
       words, it is assumed that there is at least  one  listener
       on a designated net_spec, and that its tag is identical to
       the last component of the net_spec.  This listener may  be
       thought of as the primary, or default, listener for a par-
       ticular net_spec.

       nlsadmin is also used  in  conjunction  with  the  Service
       Access Facility commands.  In that capacity, the following
       combinations of options can be used:  writes  the  current
       version  number  of  the listener's administrative file to
       the standard output.  It is used as part  of  the  command
       line when sacadm adds a listener to the system.
       formats  the  port monitor-specific information to be used
       as an argument to

       The -c option specifies the full path name of  the  server
       and  its  arguments.   cmd must appear as a single word to
       the shell; its arguments must  be  surrounded  by  quotes.
       cmd may contain supplementary code set characters.

       The  -o  option  specifies the full path name of a FIFO or
       named STREAM through which a standing server  is  actually
       receiving the connection.

                                                                3

       If the -p option is specified, then modules will be inter-
       preted as a list of STREAMS modules for  the  listener  to
       push before starting the service being added.  The modules
       are pushed in the order in which they are specified.  mod-
       ules  must  be a comma-separated list, with no white space
       included.

       If the -A option is specified, then address will be inter-
       preted as the server's private address.  The listener will
       monitor this address on behalf of  the  service  and  will
       dispatch  all  calls  arriving on this address directly to
       the designated service.  This option may not  be  used  in
       conjunction with the -D option.

       If  the  -D  option  is  specified,  then  the  service is
       assigned a private address dynamically, that is, the  lis-
       tener  will have the transport provider select the address
       each time the listener begins listening on behalf of  this
       service.   For  RPC services, this option will be often be
       used in conjunction with the -R  option  to  register  the
       dynamically  assigned  address  with  the rpcbinder.  This
       option may not be used in conjunction with the -A  option.

       When  the  -R  option  is specified, the service is an RPC
       service whose address, program number, and version  number
       should be registered with the rpcbinder for this transport
       provider.  This registration is performed  each  time  the
       listener  begins  listening  on  behalf  of  the  service.
       prognum and versnum are the  program  number  and  version
       number, respectively, of the RPC service.  nlsadmin may be
       invoked by any user to generate reports.

       The options specific to the Service  Access  Facility  may
       not be mixed with any other options.

       The  network listener process may be used with any network
       (more precisely, with  any  connection-oriented  transport
       provider) that conforms to the transport provider specifi-
       cation.

       nlsadmin can establish a listener process for a given net-
       work,  configure the specific attributes of that listener,
       and start and kill the listener process for that  network.
       nlsadmin  can  also  report on the listener processes on a
       machine, either  individually  (per  network)  or  collec-
       tively.

       net_spec   represents   a   particular  listener  process.
       Specifically, net_spec is the relative path  name  of  the
       entry under /dev for a given network (that is, a transport
       provider); net_spec must be specified in ASCII characters.
       address  is  a transport address on which to listen and is
       interpreted using a syntax that allows for  a  variety  of

                                                                4

       address  formats.   By  default, address is interpreted as
       the  symbolic  ASCII  representation  of   the   transport
       address.   An  address preceded by a \x will let you enter
       an address in hexadecimal  notation.   Note  that  address
       must appear as a single word to the shell and thus must be
       quoted if it contains any blanks.

       nlsadmin processes supplementary code  set  characters  in
       the  cmd  given  to the -c option and the comment given to
       the -y option (see below) according to the  locale  speci-
       fied in the LC_CTYPE environment variable (see LANG on
