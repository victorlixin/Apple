       cdvd  reads  the Primary Volume Descriptor from the CD-ROM
       and produces a table that lists each field  and  its  con-
       tents.   If the -b option is not used, the Application Use
       field is not listed because it may  contain  non-printable
       characters.   A  file or directory in the CD-ROM file sys-
       tem, or a block special file that holds a CD-ROM file sys-
       tem.  Copies the entire Primary Volume Descriptor from CD-
       ROM to standard output in  binary  format,  including  the
       Application Use field.

       If  LC_TIME  (which  determines the format and contents of
       the date and time strings) is not set or  is  set  to  the
       empty  string,  then cdvd uses the value of LANG.  If LANG
       is not set, or is set to the empty string, cdvd  uses  the
       value from the implementation-specific default locale.  If
       both LC_TIME  and  LANG  contain  invalid  settings,  cdvd
       behaves as if all of the variables are undefined.
