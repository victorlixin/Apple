       mconnect  opens a connection to the mail server on a given
       host, so that it can be tested independently of all  other
       mail software. If no host is given, the connection is made
       to the local host.  The server at the  other  end  of  the
       connection  expects any communication over this connection
       to conform to the Simple Mail  Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP).
       Exit  by  typing the quit command. Typing end-of-file will
       cause an end of file to be sent to the server.  An  inter-
       rupt closes the connection immediately and exits.

       Raw  mode:  disable  the  default line buffering and input
       handling.  This gives you a similar effect  as  telnet  to
       port  number 25, not very useful.  Specify the port number
       instead of the default SMTP port (number 25) as  the  next
       argument.   Specify  a  destination  host  instead  of the
       default host (localhost).
