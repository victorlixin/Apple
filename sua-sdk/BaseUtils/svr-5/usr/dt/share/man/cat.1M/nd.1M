       The  nd  command is used to start, stop or restart config-
       ured network adapter drivers.  It  can  also  be  used  to
       switch  to a backup device (failover) for a network inter-
       face or to revert to the primary device (failback).

       Configured network adapter drivers start automatically  at
       system startup because /etc/nd is run by /etc/rc2.d/S15nd.
       Similarly, configured network adapter drivers  stop  auto-
       matically  at  system  shutdown  because /etc/nd is run by
       /etc/rc0.d/K85nd.  See and for further information.

       The nd command accepts the following arguments:  The  name
       of the driver instance on which the command will act.  The
       interface name takes the form netX, where X is a number in
       the  range  0 through N-1, and N is the number of adapters
       configured in your system.  If the interface is not speci-
       fied with start, stop, or restart, nd will start, stop, or
       restart all configured drivers.  Start a  network  driver.
       Stop  a  network  driver.   Restart a network driver after
       hardware failure.  Switch the  specified  interface  to  a
       backup device.  Switch the specified interface back to the
       primary  device.   Print  information  about  a  specified
       interface  on  the standard output.  The action determines
       the type of information that is returned.

       The actions that are  recognized,  the  possible  returned
       values and their meaning are shown in the following table:

       If an unknown action is specified, nd  returns  INFO  FAIL
       OPTION.   If an unknown interface is specified, nd returns
       INFO FAIL DEVICE.  The nd command starts the dlpid daemon,
       which  links an instance of the common DLPI module to each
       MDI driver  instance.  The  startup  of  nd  precedes  the
       startup of network transport stacks and other higher-level
       protocols.

       Do not manually edit the network driver startup and  shut-
       down scripts. Doing so may disable the drivers. Use the to
       add and modify network adapter driver configuration.
