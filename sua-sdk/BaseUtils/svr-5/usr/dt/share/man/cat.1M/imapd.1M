       imapd  is  a  server  which supports the IMAP4 remote mail
       access protocol as documented in RFC-1730. It is  normally
       invoked  by the Internet server (see the manual page), for
       requests to connect to the IMAP4 port as indicated by  the
       /etc/services  file  (see the manual page). Normally, this
       is port 143.

       imapd can also be accessed via by many -based clients.  To
       do  this, the imapd binary must have a link to /etc/rimapd
       since this  is  where  this  software  expects  it  to  be
       located.
