       udisetup [options] [UDI_pkg_file]

       udisetup  installs  a  driver that has been packaged using
       the command onto an intended target system.  udisetup con-
       verts  the  driver  files into an appropriate native form,
       installs copies of them  into  environment-specific  loca-
       tions, and performs any other operations necessary to make
       the driver available for use.

       With no command-line arguments, udisetup searches the cur-
       rent  working  directory  for  all files ending in .udi or
       .UDI, and either installs all of the drivers in all of the
       packages,  or  allows  the  packages to be chosen interac-
       tively if there are more than one.

       The following command-line options are understood: Specify
       whether  or  not  to  confirm  each package and component.
       Build debug objects.  Display help message.   Display  the
       full  usage  information.   Specify that udisetup is being
       executed for a mapper.  Do a dry run  of  udisetup.   Used
       with  the  -v option, commands are not executed.  Commands
       are echoed only.  Specify output directory.   By  default,
       output  is  directed  to  the  current  working directory.
       Build optimized objects.  Specify the name of the  operat-
       ing  system-specific  package  for  this  driver.  Specify
       quiet mode; minimal  output  on  success.   Stop  udisetup
       prior  to  install.   Show  current UDI setup; no input is
       processed.  Specify a temporary directory for udisetup  to
       use.  By default, this directory is /tmp.  Specify verbose
       output.  Display the help message.  Specify the  udi-pack-
       aged file on which to run udisetup.
