       The  auditoff shell level command allows the administrator
       with the appropriate privileges to disable auditing.   The
       privileges required are audit and setplevel.

       The  execution  of  auditoff  while  auditing  is  enabled
       results in a flush of the audit buffer(s) to the audit log
       file.  Additionally, a record indicating auditing has been
       disabled is written to the audit log file via the auditdmp
       system  call.  If the &lkpou8; is installed, but disabled,
       executing an auditoff command  enables  the  &lkp;.   When
       auditing  is  disabled  the  auditable events currently in
       progress will not have a record written to the  audit  log
       file  since  they  did  not  complete  while  auditing was
       enabled.

       When the auditoff command is invoked and returns  success,
       the following message will be displayed: Auditing disabled
