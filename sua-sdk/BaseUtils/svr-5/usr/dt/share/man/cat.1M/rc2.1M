       This  file is executed via an entry in /etc/inittab and is
       responsible for those initializations that bring the  sys-
       tem to a ready-to-use state, traditionally state 2, called
       the ``multi-user'' state.

       The actions performed by rc2 are found  in  files  in  the
       directory   /etc/rc.d   and  files  beginning  with  S  in
       /etc/rc2.d.  These files are executed  by  /usr/bin/sh  in
       ASCII  sort-sequence order.  When functions are added that
       need to be initialized when the system goes multi-user, an
       appropriate file should be added in /etc/rc2.d.

       The  functions  done  by  the  rc2  command and associated
       /etc/rc2.d files include: Setting and exporting the  TIME-
       ZONE  variable.   Cleaning  up  (remaking)  the  /tmp  and
       /var/tmp directories.  Loading the network  interface  and
       ports  cards with program data and starting the associated
       processes.   Starting  the  cron   daemon   by   executing
       /usr/sbin/cron.  Cleaning up (deleting) uucp locks status,
       and temporary  files  in  the  /var/spool/uucp  directory.
       Other  functions can be added, as required, to support the
       addition of hardware and software features.

       Here are some hints about files in /etc/rc.d:

       The order in which files are executed is important.  Since
       they  are executed in ASCII sort-sequence order, using the
       first character of the filename as  a  sequence  indicator
       will  help  keep  the  proper order.  Thus, files starting
       with the following characters would be: very  early  early
       later  last  Files  in /etc/rc.d that begin with a dot (.)
       will not be executed.  This feature can be  used  to  hide
       files that are not to be executed for the time being with-
       out removing them.  The command can  be  used  only  by  a
       privileged user.

       Files  in  /etc/rc2.d must begin with an S or a K followed
       by a number and the rest of the filename.   Upon  entering
       run  level 2, files beginning with S are executed with the
       start option; files beginning with K,  are  executed  with
       the  stop  option.   Files beginning with other characters
       are ignored.

       The following are prototypical files found in  /etc/rc2.d.
       In  a real installation, these filenames would be prefixed
       with an S and a number indicating the execution  order  of
       the  files.   #     Set  up  and  mount  filesystems  cd /

                                                                1

       rm   -rf  /usr/spool/locks/*  The  file  /etc/TIMEZONE  is
       included early in rc2, thus establishing the default  time
       zone for all commands that follow.
