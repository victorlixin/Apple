       The config_search script runs the Verity bulk insert oper-
       ation to update the search index files.   It  is  normally
       run  automatically by or unless the -n option is used with
       those scripts to defer the indexing operation.

       This script is  most  useful  when  several  documentation
       packages  are  being  installed at the same time.  You can
       speed up the  installation  by  deferring  the  (sometimes
       lengthy)  index  optimization  process and running it once
       after all the documentation has been installed.   In  this
       case,  add  the  -n option to each instance of config_help
       and config_man in your installation scripts.  This  gener-
       ates  the  .vbi  bulk  insert  files and places them under
       _SearchIndex/Insert or _SearchIndex/Delete,  depending  on
       what  is  being  added or removed.  For topics or man sec-
       tions being updated, the old data is placed  under  Delete
       and  the  new data is placed under Insert.  Your installa-
       tion script should then run config_search to  process  all
       the bulk insert files.

       If  there  are  more  than  15  items  in  the queue to be
       indexed, config_search defers  the  indexing  process  and
       displays  a  message to this effect to standard error.  In
       this case, to index all the items in  the  queue,  specify
       the  -f  option: /usr/man/bin/config_search -f By default,
       the Verity indexing process is not performed automatically
       at Initial System Load (ISL).  Before users can access the
       full capabilities of the Search and Print  functions,  the
       documentation  must be indexed.  To index all of the docu-
       mentation on the system, the system administrator must run
       config_search  with  the  -f  option.  If the -L option is
       specified, the processes are run  on  the  given  language
       (LANG);  otherwise  all  language  versions are processed.
       For example, the following command runs  config_search  on
       all  the  topicID  directories  under the es (Spanish lan-
       guage) directory: config_search -L  es  The  config_search
       command  attempts  to enable or disable each language col-
       lection for searching.  To  determine  if  a  language  is
       enabled  after  running config_search, click on the Search
       button and then click on Options.  For each  enabled  lan-
       guage,  the  Search interface displays a checkbox (the box
       is checked or not depending on the user's LANG setting  or
       the user's selection of checkboxes).

       If a language is installed and config_search has been run,
       the language will be enabled if there are any index  files
       under    /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/_SearchIndex/Indexed.    If
       there are no files in Indexed, the language  is  disabled.
       The  config_search utility manages the language configura-
       tion by changing the State field (from  State=Disabled  to

                                                                1

config_search(1M)                               config_search(1M)

       State=Enabled)  for the appropriate language collection in
       the  search  configuration  file   /usr/ns-home/httpd-sco-
       helphttp/search97/bin/inetsrch.ini.

       When  run  either  automatically  or  manually,  the  con-
       fig_search script performs the following actions: For each
       language  to  be processed, create the Verity index direc-
       tory _SearchIndex, if it does not already exist.   If  any
       .vbi  files exist under _SearchIndex/Delete, run the index
       delete operation on that data.  If any  .vbi  files  exist
       under  _SearchIndex/Insert, run the index insert operation
       on that data.  For each file that is  inserted,  move  the
       file  to  _SearchIndex/Indexed.  This saves the index data
       so that if the HTML files are  removed  later,  the  index
       data  can be removed from the search index.  Run the index
       optimization process.  The _SearchIndex  directory  struc-
       ture  is  automatically  maintained; documentation package
       removal scripts should not perform  any  actions  in  this
       area.
