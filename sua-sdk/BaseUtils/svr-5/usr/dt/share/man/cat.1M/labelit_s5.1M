       generic_options  are  options  supported  by  the  generic
       labelit command.

       labelit  can  be  used  to provide labels for unmounted s5
       disk filesystems or s5 filesystems being copied to tape.

       With the optional arguments omitted, labelit  prints  cur-
       rent label values.

       The  special  name should be the disk partition (for exam-
       ple, /dev/rdsk/*), or the  cartridge  tape  (for  example,
       /dev/rmt/*,  where  the  value of * is machine dependent.)
       The device may not be on a remote machine.

       The fsname argument represents the mounted name (for exam-
       ple, root, usr, and so on) of the filesystem.  fsname must
       be less than seven characters long.

       volume may be used to equate an internal name to a  volume
       name  applied  externally  to  the  hard disk, diskette or
       tape.  volume must be less than seven characters long.

       For filesystems on disk, fsname and volume are recorded in
       the superblock.

       The  options  are:  Specify the s5 FSType. If -F s5 is not
       specified heuristics similiar to those used by are used to
       determine  the  file  system  type.  This command executes
       faster if it is not required  to  autodetect  file  system
       types.  If  possible, specify -F s5.  Provides for initial
       tape labeling only.  (This destroys the previous  contents
       of the tape.)
