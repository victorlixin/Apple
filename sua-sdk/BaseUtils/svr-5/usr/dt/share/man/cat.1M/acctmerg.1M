       acctmerg reads its standard input and  up  to  nine  addi-
       tional  files,  all  in  the tacct format (see or an ASCII
       version thereof.  It merges these inputs by adding records
       whose  keys (normally user ID and name) are identical, and
       expects the inputs to be sorted on  those  keys.   Options
       are:  Produce  output  in  ASCII  version of tacct.  Input
       files are in ASCII version of tacct.  Print input with  no
       processing.   Produce  a  single  record  that  totals all
       input.  Summarize by user ID,  rather  than  user  ID  and
       name.   Produce  output in verbose ASCII format, with more
       precise notation for floating-point numbers.

       The following sequence is useful for making ``repairs'' to
       any  file kept in this format: acctmerg -v < file1 > file2
       Edit file2 as desired . . .  acctmerg -i < file2 > file1
