       The vtgetty command is invoked by It is the second process
       in the series (init-vtgetty-getty-login-shell) that passes
       its arguments and  executes  /etc/getty.   The  /etc/getty
       process  will  eventually connect a user with the  system.
       vtgetty can be executed only by a  user  with  appropriate
       privilege (a process with the user-ID of root).

       The command options are identical to those of

       Initially,  vtgetty opens the device and determines if any
       virtual terminals (vts) are  open  for  that  device.   If
       there  are active vts, the user will be prompted to deter-
       mine if the vts should be closed automatically or manually
       when  the  user  logs  out.   If  the  automatic option is
       selected,  vtgetty  will  send  the  signals,  SIGHUP  and
       SIGTERM, to each open vt.  It will then wait 2 seconds and
       send a SIGKILL signal to the vts to ensure  that  all  the
       vts are terminated.

       If the manual closure option is selected, the highest num-
       bered vt will be activated and the user can manually close
       the vt.  This will be repeated until all open vts are man-
       ually closed.
