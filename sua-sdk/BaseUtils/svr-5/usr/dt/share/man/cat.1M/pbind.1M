       The  processor_id is an integer that uniquely identifies a
       processor; the pid is the process ID.

       LWPs that are bound to a processor will run only  on  that
       processor,   except  briefly  when  the  LWPs  requires  a
       resource that only another  processor  can  provide.   The
       processor  may  run  other  processes in addition to those
       which are bound to it.

       If there are already processes exclusively  bound  to  the
       specified  processor  (for example, by pexbind), the pbind
       command will fail.

       If an LWP specified by pid is already bound to a different
       processor,  the  binding for that process shall be changed
       to the specified processor.  If, however, an LWP specified
       by  pid is bound exclusively (for example, by pexbind) the
       pbind command will fail.

       Users can control only those processes they own unless the
       user is a privileged user.

       The options are: specifies a processor bind operation dis-
       plays non-exclusive binding information for the  specified
       pids.   When no pids are specified, pbind displays binding
       information for the entire system.  removes  any  previous
       non-exclusive binding for the specified processes

       The following conditions result in abnormal program termi-
       nation: The user does not have appropriate privilege.  The
       specified  processor_id is invalid.  The specified proces-
       sor has one or more LWPs exclusively bound to it.

       The format of the output displayed by pbind -q may  change
       significantly in a future release.  Applications and shell
       scripts should not depend on this format.
