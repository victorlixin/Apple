       pciprint  is  a sample print program that can also convert
       characters between DOS and the operating system.

       pciprint is a shell script that is  used  as  the  default
       print program.

       When  arguments  are specified, they are the character set
       tables, so charconv can translate the  print  data.   How-
       ever, this translation is not in effect for pciprint as it
       is distributed since it can cause problems for  PostScript
       print streams.

                                                                1
