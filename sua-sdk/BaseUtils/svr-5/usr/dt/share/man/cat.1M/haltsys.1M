       The  haltsys  command  uses to flush out pending disk I/O,
       mark the filesystems as clean,  and  halt  the  processor.
       haltsys takes effect immediately, so user processes should
       be killed beforehand.  is recommended  for  normal  system
       shutdown,  because  it  warns users, terminates processes,
       then calls haltsys.  Use haltsys directly only if you can-
       not  run  shutdown; for example, because of a system prob-
       lem.

       By default, haltsys displays a prompt indicating that  the
       system  has  been shut down and can be rebooted or powered
       down.

       The reboot command performs the same function  as  haltsys
       except the system is rebooted automatically afterward.

       Only users with appropriate privileges can execute haltsys
       and reboot.
