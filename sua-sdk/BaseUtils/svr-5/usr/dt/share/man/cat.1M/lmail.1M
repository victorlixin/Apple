       lmail  interprets incoming mail received from and delivers
       it to the specified user on the local  machine.  It  locks
       the user's mailbox using the locking mechanism.

       Before  delivering mail, lmail reads the first line in the
       user's mailbox.  If the first line begins with the  string
       ``Forward  to  '',  lmail forwards the mail to the address
       following the ``Forward to '' string  instead  of  putting
       the  mail in the user's mailbox.  The address must be in a
       format consistent with those described in
