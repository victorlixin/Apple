       ppplinkadd adds a link to the nominated outgoing PPP  bun-
       dle by passing the specified bundle name and optional link
       name to the PPP daemon, (The bundle  and  link  must  have
       been  previously configured using pppd looks up the bundle
       and link names, and adds the link to the  bundle.   If  no
       link  name is specified, pppd will select a pre-configured
       link.

       In default synchronous mode, ppplinkadd does not return to
       the  shell prompt until either a usable PPP connection has
       been established with the remote host which  can  use  the
       new link, or a timeout has occurred.

       The  following  options are available: Select asynchronous
       mode. In this mode, pppattach sends a linkadd  command  to
       pppd,  and  then exits without monitoring the state of the
       bundle.  The status of the bundle is checked every  period
       seconds  to  verify  if  the bundle is usable.  In verbose
       mode, the on-screen status is also updated.  Set the time-
       out  value  for the connection.  The default timeout value
       is 120 seconds.  A timeout value of 0 will cause an indef-
       inite  wait  if  the  additional  link is not established.
       Turn on verbose mode. In this mode, status information for
       the  bundle,  bundle  protocols and link protocols will be
       displayed.

       In verbose mode, the  state  of  links  are  displayed  on
       screen.  If  a link has been specified then information on
       that link only will be displayed  along  with  bundle  and
       link protocol information. If a link is not specified then
       information on links will be shown up to the  point  where
       the  information  would  overflow  the screen. For systems
       using high numbers of links within a single bundle, use to
       provide full information about all links.

       In  synchronous mode, the following exit codes can be used
       to diagnose establishment of  the  additional  link:  Link
       added  successful.  Unable to add link because the command
       or its arguments are invalid.  Unable to add link  because
       the bundle name is invalid.  Unable to add link within the
       specified timeout value (note that link establishment  may
       still  be in progress, even though pppattach has timed out
       and returned to the shell prompt).  Unable to add link due
       to  an unexpected error from pppd.  Unable to add link due
       to a dialer error.  An unspecified error occurred.

                                                                1
