       generic_options  are  options  supported by the generic ff
       command.

       ff reads the i-list and directories of the  special  file,
       assuming it is an s5 filesystem.  I-node data is saved for
       files which match the selection criteria.  Output consists
       of  the  pathname  for  each saved i-node, plus other file
       information requested using the print options below.  Out-
       put  fields  are positional.  The output is produced in i-
       node order; fields are separated by tab  characters.   The
       default  line  produced  by  ff is: path-name i-number The
       pathname is preceded by a . (dot) unless the -p option  is
       specified.

       The  maximum information the command provides is: pathname
       i-number size uid The argument n in  the  option  descrip-
       tions that follow is used as a decimal integer (optionally
       signed), where + n means more than n, - n means less  than
       n,  and  n means exactly n.  A day is defined as a 24 hour
       period.

       Specify the s5-FSType. If -F FSType is not specified it is
       determined  by  matching  the  special  with  an  entry in
       /etc/vfstab.  If this fails, heuristics similiar to  those
       used  by  are  used to determine the file system type.  If
       the FSType is known beforehand, use the  -F  option.  This
       command  executes  faster if it is not required to autode-
       tect file system types.  Do not print  the  i-node  number
       after each pathname.  Generate a supplementary list of all
       pathnames for multiply-linked files.  The specified prefix
       is  added  to  each  generated pathname.  The default is .
       (dot).  Print the file size, in bytes,  after  each  path-
       name.   Print  the owner's login name after each pathname.
       Select if the i-node has been accessed in n days.   Select
       if  the i-node has been modified in n days.  Select if the
       i-node has been changed in n days.  Select if  the  i-node
       has  been  modified  more recently than the argument file.
       Generate names for only those i-nodes specified in i-node-
       list.   i-node-list is a list of numbers separated by com-
       mas and without spaces.

       If the -l option is not specified, only a single  pathname
       out  of  all  possible  ones  is generated for a multiply-
       linked i-node.  If -l is specified, all possible names for
       every  linked  file  on the filesystem are included in the

                                                                1

       output.  If -l and -i are both specified,  then  only  the
       names for linked files matching an i-node listed in the i-
       node list are displayed.
