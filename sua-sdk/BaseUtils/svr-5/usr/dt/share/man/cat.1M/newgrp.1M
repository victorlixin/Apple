       The  command  newgrp  changes  a user's real and effective
       group identification.  The user remains logged in and  the
       current  directory  is unchanged.  The user is given a new
       shell that replaces the current shell, whether newgrp ter-
       minated  successfully or due to an error condition.  A new
       shell is created even if the group is not changed.

       Exported variables retain their values after invoking new-
       grp; however, all unexported variables are either reset to
       their default value or set to null.  Environment variables
       (such  as PS1, PS2, PATH, MAIL, and HOME), unless exported
       by the system or explicitly  exported  by  the  user,  are
       reset  to  default values.  For example, a user has a pri-
       mary prompt string (PS1) other than $  (default)  and  has
       not exported PS1.  After an invocation of newgrp, success-
       ful or not, the user's PS1 will now be set to the  default
       prompt string $.  The shell command export (see the manual
       page) should be used to  export  variables  so  that  they
       retain their assigned value when new shells are invoked.

       With  no  arguments,  newgrp  changes the user's group IDs
       (real and effective) back to the group  specified  in  the
       user's  password  file  entry.   This is a way to undo the
       effect of an earlier newgrp command.

       If the first argument to newgrp is a - or -l, the environ-
       ment  is  changed  to  what  would be expected if the user
       logged in again as a member of the new group.
