       chroot causes the given command to be executed relative to
       the new root.  The meaning of any initial slashes  (/)  in
       the  path  names is changed for the command and any of its
       child processes to newroot.  Furthermore, upon  execution,
       the initial working directory is newroot.

       Notice,  however,  that  if you redirect the output of the
       command to a file: chroot newroot command > x will  create
       the  file  x relative to the original root of the command,
       not the new one.

       The new root path name is always relative to  the  current
       root: even if a chroot is currently in effect, the newroot
       argument is relative to the current root  of  the  running
       process.

       This command can be run only by a privileged user.

       One  should  exercise  extreme  caution  when  referencing
       device files in the new root file system.

       When using chroot, do not exec a command that uses  shared
       libraries.  This will result in killing your process.
