       getdev generates a list of devices that match certain cri-
       teria.  These criteria include a list of attributes (given
       in expressions) and a list of devices.  If no criteria are
       given, all devices are included in the generated list.

       The options for getdev are: Specifies  that  the  list  of
       devices  that  follows  on the command line must match all
       criteria to be included in the list generated by this com-
       mand.   The flag has no effect if no criteria are defined.
       Specifies that the list of devices following on  the  com-
       mand  line  should  be excluded from the list generated by
       this command.  The flag has no effect if  no  devices  are
       defined.  Defines the criteria that a device must match to
       be included in the generated list.  The criteria should be
       given  in expressions.  Defines the devices that should be
       included or excluded (based on the command options) in the
       generated list.  This can be the pathname of the device or
       the device alias.

       The criteria argument may be specified  with  any  of  the
       following  four  expression  types: Select all devices for
       which attribute is defined and is equal to value.   Select
       all  devices  for  which attribute is defined and does not
       equal value.  Select all devices for  which  attribute  is
       defined.   Select  all  devices that do not have attribute
       defined.  See the manual page for a complete  listing  and
       description of available attributes.

       If  successful,  getdev  exits with a code of 0.  If there
       are errors, the command exits with one  of  the  following
       values   and   prints  the  corresponding  error  message:
       usage:getdev [-ae] [criterion[...]] [device[...]]   Device
       Database  in  inconsistent  state  -  notify administrator
       Device Database could not be opened for reading

       Devices must satisfy at least one of the criteria  in  the
       list  unless  the  -a  option  is  used.  Then, only those
       devices that match all the criteria  in  a  list  will  be
       included in the generated list.

       Devices  that  are  defined  on  the command line and that
       match the criteria are included  in  the  generated  list.
       However,  if  the  -e  flag  is  used, the list of devices
       defined on the command line becomes a set of devices to be
       excluded from the list.
