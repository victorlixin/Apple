       dcopy copies filesystem inputfs to outputfs.   inputfs  is
       the  device  file for the existing filesystem; outputfs is
       the device file to hold the reorganized result.   For  the
       most  effective  optimization  inputfs  should  be the raw
       device and outputfs should  be  the  block  device.   Both
       inputfs and outputfs should be unmounted filesystems.

       current_options  are  options supported by the s5-specific
       module of dcopy.  Other FSTypes do not necessarily support
       these options.  specific_options indicate suboptions spec-
       ified in a comma-separated list of suboptions and/or  key-
       word-attribute pairs for interpretation by the FSType-spe-
       cific module of the command.

       Specify the FSType on which to operate.  If -F  FSType  is
       not  specified  it  is  determined by matching the inputfs
       (device) with an entry in  /etc/vfstab.   If  this  fails,
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the file system type.  If the FSType is known  beforehand,
       use  the  -F option. This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system  types.   Echo  the
       complete  command  line,  but  do not execute the command.
       The command line is generated by  using  the  options  and
       arguments provided by the user and adding to them informa-
       tion derived from /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used
       to  verify and validate the command line.  Specify FSType-
       specific options.
