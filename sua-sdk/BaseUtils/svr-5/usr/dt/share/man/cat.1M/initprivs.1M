       The  initprivs  command initializes the system with privi-
       lege  information.   It  reads   this   information   from
       /etc/security/tcb/privs.  Invalid entries in this file are
       ignored.  If the validity information for the  entry  does
       not  match  the  validity  information stored on disk, the
       file specified by the entry is not privileged.  In  either
       case,  a  warning  is  issued if the command is run at the
       shell level.  Otherwise, initprivs operates silently.

       initprivs must have the P_SETSPRIV  or  P_SETUPRIV  privi-
       lege.   Otherwise  permission is denied.  In addition, the
       maximum privilege set of initprivs must be a super-set  of
       the  privileges  to be set.  If not, only those privileges
       in the maximum set of initprivs that can be  set  for  the
       file are in effect.

       The  file  /etc/default/privcmds  contains  the  following
       parameter: If the value of this parameter is No, then  the
       initprivs  command  will  not validate the check sum value
       stored  in  the  Privilege  Data  File  (PDF)  located  in
       /etc/security/tcb/privs;  this  results  in faster perfor-
       mance compared to validating the check sum value each time
       the  command  is  run.   If the value of this parameter is
       anything other than No (including null, the default), then
       the  initprivs  command  validates  the check sum for each
       file each time it is run.

       initprivs exits with a return code of  0  upon  successful
       completion.

       If initprivs detects errors, the following messages may be
       displayed: Cannot clear file privileges on  ``file''  File
       ``file'' fails validation; entry ignored.  1 entry ignored
       in  ``/etc/security/tcb/privs''  #  entries   ignored   in
       ``/etc/security/tcb/privs''
