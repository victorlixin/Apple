       sysdef  analyzes  the default bootable kernel and extracts
       configuration information. The output from sysdef includes
       hardware and software specifications used when the operat-
       ing system was built. The  configuration  information  may
       include hardware configuration as well as software devices
       and tunable parameters.  The format of  the  configuration
       information displayed is implementation defined.

       The default system namelist is /stand/unix.

       the kernel that is currently  in  memory  (that  is,  from
       /dev/kmem) rather than from a file.
