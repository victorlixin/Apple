       pppattach  starts  a manual outgoing PPP bundle by passing
       the specified bundle name to the  PPP  daemon,  (You  must
       have  previously  configured the bundle using the PPP Man-
       ager, or the PPP Internet Connection Manager.)  pppd looks
       up  the named bundle and connects to the remote host iden-
       tified by the remotesys entry in the bundle.

       In default synchronous mode, pppattach does not return  to
       the  shell prompt until either a usable PPP connection has
       been established with the  remote  host,  or  the  timeout
       value expires.

       The  following  options are available: Select asynchronous
       mode. In this mode, pppattach sends an attach  command  to
       pppd,  and  then exits without monitoring the state of the
       bundle.  The status of the bundle is checked every  period
       seconds  to  verify  if  the bundle is usable.  In verbose
       mode, the on-screen status is also updated.  Set the time-
       out  value  for the connection.  The default timeout value
       is 120 seconds.  A timeout value of 0 will cause an indef-
       inite  wait if the connection is not established.  Turn on
       verbose mode. In this mode,  status  information  for  the
       bundle,  bundle  protocols and link protocols will be dis-
       played.

       In synchronous mode, the following exit codes can be  used
       to  diagnose  establishment  of the connection: Connection
       establishment successful.  Unable to establish  connection
       because  the command or its arguments are invalid.  Unable
       to  establish  connection  because  the  bundle  name   is
       invalid.  Unable to establish connection within the speci-
       fied timeout value (note that connection establishment may
       still  be in progress, even though pppattach has timed out
       and returned to the shell prompt).   Unable  to  establish
       connection  due  to an unexpected error from pppd.  Unable
       to establish connection due to a dialer error.  An unspec-
       ified error occurred.
