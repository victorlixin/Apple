       generic_options are options supported by the generic mount
       command.  mount attaches a ufs filesystem,  referenced  by
       special, to the filesystem hierarchy at the pathname loca-
       tion  mount_point,   which   must   already   exist.    If
       mount_point has any contents prior to the mount operation,
       these remain hidden until the  filesystem  is  once  again
       unmounted.

       Specify the ufs FSType. If -F ufs is not specified heuris-
       tics similiar to those used by are used to  determine  the
       file  system  type.  This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify  the  -F  ufs.   Mount  the  filesystem read-only.
       Specify the ufs filesystem specific options  in  a  comma-
       separated list.  If invalid options are specified, a warn-
       ing  message  is  printed  and  the  invalid  options  are
       ignored.   Multiple  filesystem-specific  options  may  be
       listed in any order, but must be separated by commas.  The
       following  options  are  available:  Fake  an  /etc/mnttab
       entry, but do not actually mount any filesystems.  Parame-
       ters  are not verified.  Mount the filesystem without mak-
       ing an entry in  /etc/mnttab.   Read/write  or  read-only.
       Default  is rw.  By default the filesystem is mounted with
       setuid execution allowed.  Specifying nosuid overrides the
       default  and  causes  the  filesystem  to  be mounted with
       setuid execution disallowed.  Used in conjunction with rw.
       A  filesystem  mounted  read-only  can  be remounted read-
       write.  Fails if the filesystem is not  currently  mounted
       or if the filesystem is mounted rw.  Specifies that writes
       need not be written out to disk until  the  filesystem  is
       about  to be unmounted. This volatility can improve system
       throughput as much as eight  percent  when  the  temporary
       directories  (for  example, /tmp and /var/tmp) are mounted
       this way.

       If the directory on which a filesystem is to be mounted is
       a  symbolic  link, the filesystem is mounted on the direc-
       tory to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top
       of the symbolic link itself.
