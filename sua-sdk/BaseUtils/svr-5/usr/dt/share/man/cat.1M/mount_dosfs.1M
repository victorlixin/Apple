       mount attaches a dosfs file system, referenced by special,
       to the file system  hierarchy  at  the  pathname  location
       mount_point, which must already exist.  If mount_point has
       any contents prior to the mount  operation,  these  remain
       hidden until the file system is once again unmounted.

       The option is:

       Specify  the  dosfs  FSType.  If -F dosfs is not specified
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the  file system type.  This command executes faster if it
       is not required to autodetect file system types. If possi-
       ble, specify the -F dosfs.

       If  the  directory on which a file system is to be mounted
       is a symbolic link, the file  system  is  mounted  on  the
       directory  to  which the symbolic link refers, rather than
       on top of the symbolic link itself.
