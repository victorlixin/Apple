       The  richtext program allows users to view "text/richtext"
       and "text/enriched" files on  an  ASCII  terminal.   Files
       considered  to  be  richtext  are based on a simple markup
       language designed to send richtext through the mail.

       richtext employs termcap capabilities  to  highlight  text
       that  is  supposed  to be bold or italic, and to underline
       text that is supposed to be underlined.   It  also  imple-
       ments  a set of richtext subcommands that provide for text
       indentation and justification, as well as  formatting  for
       excerpt and signature.

       The   richtext   program   takes   raw   text/richtext  or
       text/enriched output on its standard input or from a  file
       specified by filename and produces formatted output on its
       standard output, which is assumed to be a terminal.  It is
       intended primarily for use by the metamail program.

       The program will also repair the raw input to match up any
       richtext or enriched command pairs that are out of  order.

       When  invoked  with no options, richtext expects raw rich-
       text on its standard input, which is corrected,  and  then
       formatted  output  is written on its standard output.  The
       following options can alter that behavior:  Directs  rich-
       text to simply correct the raw richtext and write the cor-
       rected version to its standard output, without  performing
       any  formatting.   This  option directs richtext to expect
       text/enriched instead of  text/richtext  on  its  standard
       input.   Directs  richtext  to  use termcap derived escape
       codes for bold and italic text, even if richtext is called
       in  a  pipe.  Directs richtext to not do any correction to
       the  raw  text/richtext  or  text/enriched  it   receives.
       Directs  richtext  to  use  overstriking  for underlining,
       etc., on terminals where  this  is  the  most  appropriate
       behavior.   Enables the use of a pager which reports Press
       to go on after each screen-full of  data.   Alternatively,
       if  the environment variable MM_USEPAGER is set, the pager
       is used.  This option and the environment variable have no
       effect  if  either  standard  input  or standard output is
       redirected.  Toggles whether or not to use ANSI  mode  for
       highlighting  bold,  italic,  or  underlined  text.  (This
       option is available only under DOS.)  Directs richtext not
       to  use  termcap  derived escape codes for bold and italic
       text, even if richtext is called in a terminal.   Instead,
       the  asterisk and underscore characters (* and _) are used
       to highlight the affected text.

                                                                1

       If you are using the xterm program, you  can  control  the
       font  that  will  be used for bold text by referencing the
       xterm*boldFont resource.
