       The PPP login shell, pppsh, is executed upon receipt of an
       incoming PPP connection request at a serial port or on  an
       ISDN  channel.   pppsh  passes over control of the call to
       the PPP daemon and then exits.

       If the PPP connection is initiated by the serial port mon-
       itor  (ttymon) or the ISDN monitor (isdnmon) automatically
       detecting PPP data, the monitor first performs  call  fil-
       tering  (see  before  executing  pppsh directly (see Login
       authentication is not performed but CHAP or PAP  authenti-
       cation  must  be  performed  during negotiation of the PPP
       link.

       If the PPP connection is initiated by logging in  using  a
       chat  script,  the  monitor  first performs call filtering
       (see and then starts any services that are defined for the
       serial  port  or  ISDN  device  in the file.  If users can
       either log in remotely using PPP or locally using a  login
       shell  such as ksh, Callservices should contain entries to
       start /bin/pppsh for the  serial  ports  or  ISDN  devices
       which  will  be  used  for remote access.  If Callservices
       does not define any entries for the serial ports  or  ISDN
       devices  that will be used, or the entries start the shell
       server (see the /etc/passwd entry for the remote user must
       define  /bin/pppsh  as its login shell if a PPP session is
       to be initiated.  In all cases,  login  authenticates  the
       supplied  password. If successful, CHAP or PAP authentica-
       tion may also be performed during negotiation of  the  PPP
       link.

       The -d option generates debugging information in syslog.
