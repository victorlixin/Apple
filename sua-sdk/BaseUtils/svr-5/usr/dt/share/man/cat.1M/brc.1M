       The bcheckrc procedure first checks the status of the root
       file system.  If the root file system is found to be  bad,
       bcheckrc  repairs  it.  Then, it mounts the /stand, /proc,
       and /var (if it exists) file systems (/var may exist as  a
       directory  in  the root file system, or as a separate file
       system).  bcheckrc is executed by an entry in /etc/inittab
       by init whenever the system is booted.

       The  brc  script  performs administrative tasks related to
       file sharing.  The functionality of brc has been  incorpo-
       rated  into  other startup routines, and is no longer exe-
       cuted by /etc/inittab.  It is kept for compatibility  rea-
       sons.

       After  bcheckrc  has executed, init checks for the initde-
       fault value in /etc/inittab.  This tells init in which run
       level  to  place the system.  If, for example, initdefault
       is set to 2, the system will be placed in  the  multi-user
       state via the rc2 procedure.

       Note  that  bcheckrc should always be executed before brc.
       Also, these shell procedures may be used for several  run-
       level states.
