       The  psradm command is the interface to processor configu-
       ration management on a multiprocessor system.  It is  used
       by  system  administrators  and  operators  to  manage the
       administrative state of individual processors in a  multi-
       processor  system.   The  processor_id  is an integer that
       uniquely identifies a processor; one  or  more  processors
       can be specified.

       Successful   state   transitions   are   recorded  in  the
       /var/adm/wtmp file for later system activity accounting.

       When the -n option is specified, the following message  is
       written   to  the  kernel  log  driver:  UX:psradm:INFO:At
       MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS, processor_id was brought online.   When
       the -f option is specified, the following message is writ-
       ten to the kernel log driver:  UX:psradm:INFO:At  MM/DD/YY
       HH:MM:SS,  processor_id  was  taken  offline.  When the -d
       option is specified, the following message is  written  to
       the   kernel   log   driver:   UX:psradm:INFO:At  MM/DD/YY
       HH:MM:SS, processor_id was disabled.  The message also  is
       written to the standard output when the -v option is spec-
       ified.

       System activity such as a system reboot or putting a  pro-
       cessor online is recorded in the /var/adm/wtmp file.

       The  options  are:  Specifies that all processors are tar-
       geted for the operation.  Take the specified  processor(s)
       offline,  and make unavailable for use.  This token speci-
       fies a transition from an online or unlocked state  to  an
       offline  or locked administrative state.  If the -a option
       is specified, all online processors except the  boot  pro-
       cessor  will  be  taken offline.  Prior to this operation,
       the specified  processor(s)  may  be  in  any  operational
       state.  The processor(s) may even be just physically added
       to a system which supports the hot plugging  of  CPUs;  it
       will  be enabled but offline after specifying this option.
       Bring the specified processor(s) online or all  processors
       online  if  no  processor_id is specified.  -n specifies a
       transition  from  a  locked  administrative  state  to  an
       unlocked administrative state.  If the -a option is speci-
       fied, all offline processors will be brought online.   The
       named  processors  must be in an enabled operational state
       before this operation will succeed.  By default, the  com-
       mand  executes  silently.   The  -v  forces the command to
       report the completing status per processor_id.
