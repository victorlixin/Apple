       ddbconv   converts   the   device  table  located  in  the
       /etc/device.tab file to Device Database  (DDB)  format,  a
       format which recognized by the device management commands.
       Pathnames of device special files defined for the cdevice,
       bdevice,  cdevlist, and bdevlist attributes are moved into
       a new file, /etc/security/ddb/ddb_dsfmap.  This file  con-
       tains  mappings  between  device  special files and device
       names (aliases).  The device management software  requires
       that these mappings be unique.
