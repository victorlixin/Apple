       /usr/sbin/diskformat  low-level  formats a SCSI hard disk.
       All formatting parameters are obtained automatically  from
       the disk itself using SCSI commands.  /usr/sbin/diskformat
       is not applicable to non-SCSI hard  disks.   In  order  to
       low-level format a non-SCSI hard disk you must use a util-
       ity supplied by the vendor of your disk.

       diskformat is provided as a convenience to system adminis-
       trators  and  can only be run as root.  It is not normally
       necessary to low-level format a  SCSI  hard  disk.   Using
       diskformat may not provide an optimal format for your SCSI
       hard disk and controller combination.  It  is  recommended
       that  the  format  utility  supplied by the vendor of your
       SCSI controller be used instead.  See for  information  on
       setting up a new hard disk on a system.
