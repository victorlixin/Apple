       tunefs  is  designed to change the dynamic parameters of a
       filesystem which affect the layout policies.  The filesys-
       tem must be unmounted before using tunefs.  The parameters
       which are to be changed are indicated by the options given
       below:

       The  options are: Specify the maximum number of contiguous
       blocks that will be laid out before forcing  a  rotational
       delay  (see  -d  below).   The default value is one, since
       most device drivers require an interrupt per  disk  trans-
       fer.   Device  drivers  that  can  chain  several  buffers
       together in a single transfer should set this to the maxi-
       mum chain length.  Specify the expected time (in millisec-
       onds) to service a transfer completion interrupt and  ini-
       tiate  a  new  transfer  on  the same disk.  It is used to
       decide how much rotational spacing to place  between  suc-
       cessive  blocks in a file.  Indicate the maximum number of
       blocks any single file can  allocate  out  of  a  cylinder
       group  before it is forced to begin allocating blocks from
       another cylinder group.  Typically this value  is  set  to
       approximately  one quarter of the total blocks in a cylin-
       der group.  The intent is to prevent any single file  from
       using  up  all the blocks in a single cylinder group, thus
       degrading access times for all  files  subsequently  allo-
       cated in that cylinder group.  The effect of this limit is
       to cause big files to do long seeks more  frequently  than
       if  they  were  allowed  to  allocate  all the blocks in a
       cylinder group before seeking elsewhere.  For  filesystems
       with exclusively large files, this parameter should be set
       higher.  Change optimization strategy for the  filesystem.
       s and space are interchangeable, and t and time are inter-
       changeable.  Conserve space.  Organize file layout to min-
       imize access time.

       Generally one should optimize for time unless the filesys-
       tem is over 90% full.

       The tunable minfree is not supported on sfs file  systems.
