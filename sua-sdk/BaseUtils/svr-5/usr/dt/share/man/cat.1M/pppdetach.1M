       pppdetach  closes  a PPP bundle by passing the name of the
       bundle to the PPP daemon, (The bundle must have been  pre-
       viously  configured  using  pppd looks up the named bundle
       and closes it.

       In default synchronous mode, pppdetach does not return  to
       the   shell  prompt  until  either  the  bundle  phase  is
       ``Dead'', or the timeout value expires.

       The following options are available:  Select  asynchronous
       mode.  In  this  mode, pppdetach sends a detach command to
       pppd, and then exits without monitoring the state  of  the
       bundle.   The status of the bundle is checked every period
       seconds to verify if the bundle is ``Dead''.   In  verbose
       mode, the on-screen status is also updated.  Set the time-
       out value for  the  disconnection.   The  default  timeout
       value  is 120 seconds.  A timeout value of 0 will cause an
       indefinite wait if the connection is not closed.  Turn  on
       verbose  mode.  In  this  mode, status information for the
       bundle, bundle protocols and link protocols will  be  dis-
       played.

       In  synchronous mode, the following exit codes can be used
       to diagnose problems with  disconnection:  The  connection
       was  successfully  detached.   Unable to detach connection
       because the command or its arguments are invalid.   Unable
       to  detach  connection because the bundle name is invalid.
       Unable to detach connection within the  specified  timeout
       value  (note  that disconnection may still be in progress,
       even though pppattach has timed out and  returned  to  the
       shell  prompt).   Unable  to  detach  connection due to an
       unexpected error from pppd.  Unable to  detach  connection
       due to a dialer error.  An unspecified error occurred.
