       The  shownonascii program allows data in non-ASCII charac-
       ter sets to be viewed under X11.  By default, it opens  up
       an xterm using the font identified by charset in the first
       argument.  It then runs the more command to  view  all  of
       the  files  named  on the command line using the specified
       font.

       If the -e switch is used, the rest of the command line  is
       accepted  as a command to pass to xterm to be used instead
       of more.

       If the MM_CHARSET environment variable is set and  matches
       the  character set named in the first argument, charset, a
       new xterm window is not opened.

       If the MM_AUXCHARSETS environment  variable  is  set,  the
       character set named in the first argument is recognized as
       a subset of that string, and a new  xterm  window  is  not
       opened.
