       The  pwconv  command  creates and updates /etc/shadow with
       information from /etc/passwd.

       If the /etc/shadow file does  not  exist,  pwconv  creates
       /etc/shadow  with  information from /etc/passwd.  The com-
       mand populates /etc/shadow with  the  user's  login  name,
       password,  and  password  aging  information.  If password
       aging information does not  exist  in  /etc/passwd  for  a
       given  user,  none  is added to /etc/shadow.  However, the
       last changed information is always updated.

       If the /etc/shadow file does exist,  the  following  tasks
       are  performed:  Entries  that are in the /etc/passwd file
       and  not  in  the  /etc/shadow  file  are  added  to   the
       /etc/shadow  file.   Entries  that  are in the /etc/shadow
       file and not in the  /etc/passwd  file  are  removed  from
       /etc/shadow.   Password  attributes (for example, password
       and aging information) in an /etc/passwd entry  are  moved
       to  the  corresponding  entry  in /etc/shadow.  The pwconv
       program is a privileged system command that cannot be exe-
       cuted by ordinary users.
