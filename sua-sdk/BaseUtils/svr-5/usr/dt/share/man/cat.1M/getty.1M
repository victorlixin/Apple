       getty is included for compatibility with previous releases
       for  the  few applications that still call getty directly.
       getty can only be executed by a process with the appropri-
       ate  privileges.   Initially, getty prints the information
       from the file and the login prompt, waits for  the  user's
       login  name,  and  then  invokes the login command.  getty
       attempts to adapt the system  to  the  terminal  speed  by
       using  the  options and arguments specified on the command
       line.  The name of a TTY line in /dev to which getty is to
       attach  itself.   getty  uses this string as the name of a
       file in the /dev directory to open for reading  and  writ-
       ing.   If  the -h flag is not set, a hangup will be forced
       by setting the speed to zero before setting the  speed  to
       the  default  or  specified  speed.   specifies that getty
       should exit if the open on the line succeeds  and  no  one
       types  anything in timeout seconds.  The speed argument is
       a label  to  a  speed  and  TTY  definition  in  the  file
       /etc/ttydefs.   This  definition tells getty at what speed
       to run initially, what the initial TTY settings  are,  and
       what  speed  to  try  next,  should  the user indicate, by
       pressing the BREAK key, that the speed  is  inappropriate.
       If  not  specified  on the command line, speed defaults to
       the first entry in /etc/ttydefs.  The terminal  option  is
       the name of the terminal type.  The linedisc option is the
       name of the line discipline.  The  -c  option  performs  a
       check on the gettydefs file.

       When given no optional arguments, getty specifies the fol-
       lowing: The speed of the interface is  set  to  the  speed
       defined  in the first entry in /etc/gettydefs, either par-
       ity is allowed, new-line characters are converted to  car-
       riage  return-line feed, and tab expansion is performed on
       the standard output.  getty types the login prompt  before
       reading  the user's name a character at a time.  If a null
       character (or framing error) is received, it is assumed to
       be  the  result  of the user pressing the BREAK key.  This
       will cause getty to attempt the next speed in the  series.
       The series that getty tries is determined by what it finds
       in /etc/ttydefs.

       Administrators and developers are  encouraged  to  use  as
       support for getty may be dropped in the future.
