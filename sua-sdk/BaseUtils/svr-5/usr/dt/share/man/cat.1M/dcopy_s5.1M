       generic_options are options supported by the generic dcopy
       command.

       With no options, dcopy copies files from inputfs compress-
       ing directories by removing vacant  entries,  and  spacing
       consecutive  blocks  in  a  file by the optimal rotational
       gap.

       Specify the FSType on which to operate.  If -F  FSType  is
       not  specified  it  is  determined by matching the inputfs
       device with an  entry  in  /etc/vfstab.   If  this  fails,
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the file system type.  If the FSType is known  beforehand,
       use  the  -F option. This command executes faster if it is
       not required to  autodetect  file  system  types.   Supply
       device information for creating an optimal organization of
       blocks  in  a  file.   X  must  be  of  the  form   cylin-
       der_size:gap_size.  Place the files not accessed in n days
       after the free blocks of the destination file system If no
       n  is  specified  then no movement occurs.  Leave order of
       directory entries as is.   The  default  is  to  sort  the
       directory  based  on  how  recently  each  entry  has been
       accessed.  Entries accessed within the last 24  hours  are
       placed at the beginning of the directory.  All subdirecto-
       ries are treated as if they were accessed within the  last
       24  hours.   Reports how many files were processed and how
       big the source and destination freelists are.  Specify the
       outputfs  file system (fsize) and inode list (isize) sizes
       in logical blocks.  If the suboption (or  :isize)  is  not
       given, the values from inputfs are used.

       dcopy  catches  interrupts  and  quits  and reports on its
       progress.  To terminate dcopy, send a quit signal followed
       by an interrupt or quit.
