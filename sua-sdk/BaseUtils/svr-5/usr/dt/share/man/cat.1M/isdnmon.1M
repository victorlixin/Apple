       isdnmon is an ISDN port monitor.  It controls all /dev/isx
       interfaces that are ISDN devices configured  for  incoming
       calls.   isdnmon  is started by when the first ISDN device
       is configured for incoming calls, and  stopped  by  netcfg
       the  last device configured for incoming calls is removed.
       It should only be running when ISDN devices exist and  are
       configured  for  incoming  calls.  isdnmon creates a child
       process using to handle each incoming call.

       isdnmon monitors multiple interfaces.  It is not necessary
       to  have  multiple  instances of isdnmon for multiple ISDN
       connections.

       isdnmon is configured to run  under  (the  Service  Access
       Controller)  as part of the Service Access Facility (SAF).
       netcfg configures isdnmon  using  the  and  commands.   It
       accepts  or rejects calls based on the contents of the and
       files.

       It is not necessary to start and  stop  isdnmon  with  the
       sacadm  command Under normal circumstances, isdnmon should
       only be controlled by netcfg; it  should  not  be  invoked
       from the command line.

       isdnmon  can  be  used  to troubleshoot suspected problems
       with incoming ISDN calls.  To do so, you must stop isdnmon
       and  create log files before starting it again.  For exam-
       ple: sacadmin -k -p isdnmon  touch  /var/saf/isdnmon/isdn-
       mon.debug  touch  /var/saf/isdnmon/isdncall.debug sacadmin
       -s -p isdnmon These files are created in the /var/saf/isd-
       nmon/  directory: contains a record of all activity on the
       ISDN port, including the process ID (pid) numbers  of  the
       child  process handling each call alerts isdnmon to create
       per-call logs but does not contain  any  information  con-
       tains  information about each call, identified by the call
       handler's pid number  No  incoming  connections  are  made
       while isdnmon is stopped.

       isdnmon log files are cumulative and grow rapidly.  If you
       plan to use them for extended periods of time, you  should
       clean them out regularly with jobs.
