       The swlist command  displays  information  about  software
       products  installed  at,  or available from, the specified
       target selections.  It allows  you  to:  specify  bundles,
       products,  subproducts and/or filesets to list display the
       files contained in each fileset display a  table  of  con-
       tents  from  a  software  source specify the attributes to
       display for each software object  display  all  attributes
       for  bundles, products, subproducts, filesets and/or files
       display the full software specification to  be  used  with
       software  selections  display the readme file for products
       display the depots on a specified host create  a  list  of
       products,  subproducts  and/or filesets for input to other
       SM commands list the categories of  available  or  applied
       patches  list  applied patches and their state (applied or
       committed) If you want to list the contents of a depot  on
       a  CD you must use the -nmconv option of when mounting the
       CD.  For example: mount  -Fcdfs  -r  /dev/cdrom  -nmconv=c
       /mountpoint  If  you  do not use this option, the SM tools
       will be unable to detect the depot.

       To preview information about new software  in  the  depot,
       you  can use swlist to view the readme file for each prod-
       uct.  For example, to display the readme file for the BASH
       product,  enter:  swlist  -d  -a  readme -l product BASH @
       hostA:/depot11

       When no options or operands are  specified,  swlist  lists
       the  software bundles (and products that are not part of a
       bundle) that are installed on the local host's root (/).

       swlist supports the following options: Each object has its
       own  set  of  attributes.  These  attributes  include such
       things as revision, description,  vendor  information  and
       size.   The -a option selects a specific attribute to dis-
       play.  You can specify multiple -a options to display mul-
       tiple attributes.

       Note  that  the tag attribute (that is, the identifier) is

                                                                1

swlist(1M)                                             swlist(1M)

       always  displayed  for  product,  subproduct  and  fileset
       objects.  The  path  attribute  (that is, the filename) is
       always displayed for file objects.

       The full set of attributes for a given software object can
       be  obtained  using the -v option. See the manual page for
       details of these attributes.  Provides a means to list the
       full  catalog  structure.  If  the -c option is specified,
       output from swlist  is  written  to  an  exported  catalog
       structure  instead  of  stdout.  The -c option specifies a
       directory below which  the  catalog  information  for  the
       specified  objects  and attributes is stored. The exported
       catalog  structure   is   used   for   distributions   and
       installed_software catalog information.

       If -c catalog is specified, then -a attribute and -l level
       do not apply; all attributes down to the  file  level  and
       the control scripts are written to the catalog.  Saves the
       current options and operands  to  session_file.   You  can
       enter  a relative or absolute path with the filename.  The
       default directory  for  session  files  is  $HOME/.sw/ses-
       sions/.   You  can  recall a session file with the -S ses-
       sion_file option. You can save  session  information  with
       the -C session_file option.  In addition, swlist automati-
       cally creates a session file of the  most  recent  session
       information     called     $HOME/.sw/sessions/swlist.last.
       (Optional) Lists software available from a depot  (instead
       of  software  installed  on a root filesystem).  Reads the
       list of software selections from software_file, instead of
       (or  in  addition  to) the command line operands (given by
       software_selections).  Lists all objects down to the spec-
       ified  level.   Both the specified levels and the depth of
       the specified software selections control the depth of the
       output.   (Optional) Lists products installed on an alter-
       nate root filesystem (instead of software installed on /).
       The  same as specifying -l bundle -l product -l subproduct
       -l fileset.  Specifies the software source to  list.  This
       is  an alternative way to list a source depot. Sources can
       also be specified as target depots and listed using the -d
       option.   Runs swlist with options and operands saved from
       a previous session to session_file.  You can save  session
       information  to  a  file  with the -C session_file option.
       Reads the list  of  target  selections  from  target_file,
       instead  of  (or in addition to) the command line operands
       (given by target_selections).  Turns on verbose output  to
       stdout.  (The  command  log  file  is not affected by this
       option.) By default, verbose output is enabled for all the
       SM  commands.  Sets the default option to value, and over-
       rides the default  value  (or  a  value  in  an  alternate
       option_file  specified  with  the -X option).  Multiple -x
       options can be specified.  Reads the default  options  and
       behaviors  from  option_file.   These  values override the
       default values.  swlist supports the following format  for
       each                  software                  selection:

                                                                2

       op  vendor] [,c op category][,l=location][,fr op revision]
       [,fa op arch] Refer to the manual page for more details of
       specifying  software selections.  swlist supports the fol-
       lowing format for each target selection: [host][:][/direc-
       tory]  The  : is required if both a host and directory are
       specified.

       In addition to the standard options, several SM  behaviors
       and  policy  options  can  be changed by modifying default
       values   listed   in    the    master    defaults    file,
       /usr/lib/sw/sys.defaults.   Refer  to  the manual page for
       information about each of these default options and how to
       modify them.

       The following options are supported by swlist:
       agent_timeout_minutes           rpc_timeout
       distribution_target_directory   select_local
       layout_version                  installed_software_catalog

       Each  invocation  of  swlist  defines  a list session. The
       options, source information, software selections, and tar-
       get  selections  are  saved  before  the  actual list task
       starts. This lets you re-execute swlist even if  the  ses-
       sion  ends before the task is complete.  Refer to the man-
       ual page for further details.

       swlist  catches  the SIGQUIT and SIGINT signals.  If these
       are received, swlist writes a message, sends a Remote Pro-
       cedure  Call  (RPC)  to  the  agents  to wrap up, and then
       exits.

       Each agent will complete the list task (if  the  execution
       phase has already started) before it wraps up.

       explicitly saved by the user.  Contains the master list of
       current SM  options  (with  their  default  values).   The
       directory which contains all of the configurable (and non-
       configurable) data for SM.  This  directory  is  also  the
       default  location  of log files.  Contains the active sys-
       tem-wide default values for some or all SM  options.   The
       file  which  stores  the  list of depots registered at the
       local host.  The Installed Products Database (IPD): a cat-
       alog  of  all products installed on a system.  The default
       location of a source and target software depot.

UUssaaggee
       The output from swlist follows this rule with all options:
       only the lowest level listed (product, subproduct, fileset
       or file) will be uncommented.  Among  other  things,  this
       allows  the output to be used as input for other commands.
       The one exception is the list that  contains  files;  file
       level output is not accepted by other commands.

       The  types  of  listings  that  can  be selected are given
       below. Some of these listings are not  exclusive  choices,
       but  rather ways to view the objects while controlling the
       amount of output.  If swlist is invoked with  no  software
       selections  and  no  target  selections,  a listing of all
       installed products on the local host's root  is  produced.
       This  listing contains one line for each product. The line
       includes  the  product  tag  attributes  and   all   other
       attributes selected via the one_liner option.

       If target_selections (that is, target hosts) is specified,
       the same format listing  is  produced  for  the  installed
       software  at  each  of  the specified hosts.  A listing of
       software objects is  controlled  by  the  specified  soft-
       ware_selections, and also by the -l option (which sets the
       level default option).  swlist lists the contents of  each
       software  object  specified  in  software_selections.  For
       example, if you specify product selections,  the  subprod-
       ucts  and/or  filesets  contained  immediately  below each
       product will be listed. If you specify fileset selections,
       the files contained in each fileset will be listed.

       The  depth  of  objects  listed  is controlled with the -l
       option. This option can expand or restrict  the  depth  in
       concert   with   the  specified  software  selections.  By
       default, the contents of a  specified  software  selection
       are  always  listed. The -l option can defeat this listing
       by specifying a level equivalent to the level  of  objects
       in software_selections.

       For  example,  if you want to list specific product selec-
       tions but not their contents, use -l product.  If you want
       to  list  specific  fileset  selections but not their con-
       tained files, use  -l  fileset.   The  software  selection
       options  only  apply  if  the  level  is  bundle, product,

                                                                4

swlist(1M)                                             swlist(1M)

       subproduct, fileset, file  or  patch.   Another  class  of
       objects  that  swlist can display are software depots. For
       example, the user can list  all  registered  depots  on  a
       given  host. A combination of the -l depot option and tar-
       get_selections operands can produce  a  variety  of  depot
       listings.   Multiple  target  selections  (that  is,  root
       filesystems,  alternate  roots,  or  depots)  are   listed
       sequentially:   list   all   the   requested  objects  and
       attributes from the first target  selection,  followed  by
       the  second  target  selection,  and so on.  The -v option
       causes a verbose listing to be generated.  A verbose list-
       ing includes all attributes defined for an object.  swlist
       writes the keyword  and  value  for  each  attribute.  The
       attributes are listed one per line.

       The  depot's  attributes are displayed if swlist is called
       with the -v and -l depot options,  and  a  specific  depot
       target selection.

       Attributes  for a particular software level (product, sub-
       product, fileset or file) are displayed based on the depth
       of the specified software selections.  For example, swlist
       -v product1.fileset1  gives  all  fileset  attributes  for
       fileset1.   If -v is used with -l, the different attribute
       listings are: swlist -v -l product swlist -v -l subproduct
       swlist -v -l fileset swlist -v -l file
