       reads  the  Equipped  Device  Table (EDT) built by the SDI
       drivers and  updates  the  device  table  entries  in  the
       /etc/device.tab  file  for  any  tape and SCSI controllers
       that are present on the system.  For the first 16  slices,
       the  device  table entries are created from template files
       because the entries are unique for each device type.   The
       location  of  the  template files is specified in a target
       controller index file, which can be supplied as a command-
       line  argument.  When more than 16 slices are used, device
       nodes are created for each additional slice in use.  These
       device  nodes  are  created from the VTOC rather than from
       the template files.

       sdimkdtab keeps a record of the  EDT  from  invocation  to
       invocation  in  the  /etc/scsi/sdi_edt  file.   If the EDT
       obtained by sdimkdtab during execution is identical to the
       one in /etc/scsi/sdi_edt, no action is taken and sdimkdtab
       exits.  If the EDT has changed since the  last  invocation
       of  either  sdimkdev  or  sdimkdtab, sdimkdtab updates the
       device table entries for every device in the EDT.

       sdimkdtab takes the following options: Forces sdimkdtab to
       run  at a time other than from sdimkdtab is designed to be
       run from init; to force its execution at any  other  time,
       you  must  use  the -f option.  Forces sdimkdtab to ignore
       the existing record of  this  machine's  configuration  in
       /etc/scsi/sdi_edt  and update /etc/device.tab, as if a new
       device had been added to the system.  Use filename instead
       of  /etc/scsi/tc.index to determine which template file to
       use for each device.

       When sdimkdtab is run immediately after sdimkdev, it  must
       be  run  with the -i option or no updates will take place,
       because the EDT in /etc/scsi/sdi_edt will be the one  cre-
       ated by sdimkdev and will be up-to-date.

       On  success,  sdimkdtab  exits  with a return code of zero
       when it detects new devices on the system.  If  there  are
       no  new  devices  since  the  last time either sdimkdev or
       sdimkdtab was executed, it exits with  a  positive  return
       code.   If  an error is detected, it exits with a negative
