       The  lpusers  command  is  used to set limits to the queue
       priority level that can be assigned to jobs  submitted  by
       users of the LP print service.

       The  first  form of the command (with -d) sets the system-
       wide priority default to priority-level,  where  priority-
       level is a value of 0 to 39, with 0 being the highest pri-
       ority.  If a user does not specify a priority level with a
       print  request  (see  the  default priority is used.  Ini-
       tially, the default priority level is 20.

       The second form of the command (with -q and -u)  sets  the
       default  priority-limit (0-39) that the users in login-ID-
       list can request when submitting  a  print  request.   The
       login-ID-list  argument may include any or all of the fol-
       lowing constructs: a user on the local system  a  user  on
       the  system  system_name all users on system system_name a
       user on all systems all users on the  local  system  Users
       that have been given a limit cannot submit a print request
       with a higher priority level than the  one  assigned,  nor
       can  they  change  a  request  already submitted to have a
       higher priority.  Any print requests submitted with prior-
       ity  levels  higher than allowed will be given the highest
       priority allowed.

       The third form  of  the  command  (with  -u)  removes  any
       explicit priority limit for the specified users.

       The  fourth form of the command (with -q) sets the default
       priority limit for all users not explicitly covered by the
       use of the second form of this command.

       The  last  form of the command (with -l) lists the default
       priority level and the priority limits assigned to  users.
