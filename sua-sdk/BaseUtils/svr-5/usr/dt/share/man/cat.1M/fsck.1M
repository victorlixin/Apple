       fsck audits and interactively repairs inconsistent  condi-
       tions  for filesystems.  If the filesystem is inconsistent
       the user is prompted for concurrence before  each  correc-
       tion  is  attempted.  It should be noted that some correc-
       tive actions will result in some loss of data.  The amount
       and severity of data loss may be determined from the diag-
       nostic output.  The default action for each correction  is
       to wait for the user to respond yes or no.

       The  filesystem should be unmounted when fsck is used.  If
       this is not possible, care should be taken that the system
       is  quiescent  and  that it is rebooted immediately after-
       wards if the filesystem is a  critical  one,  for  example
       root.

       current_options  are  options supported by the s5-specific
       module of fsck.  Other FSTypes do not necessarily  support
       these options.  specific_options indicate suboptions spec-
       ified in  a  comma-separated  list  of  suboptions  and/or
       keyword-attribute  pairs for interpretation by the FSType-
       specific module of the command.

       special represents a block  or  character  special  device
       (for example, /dev/rdsk/*, where the value of * is machine
       dependent).  It is preferable  that  a  character  special
       device  be  used.  fsck will not work on a block device if
       it is mounted.  If special is  not  supplied,  fsck  looks
       through  /etc/vfstab  and  executes fsck for all character
       specials in the fsckdev field  of  /etc/vfstab  for  which
       there is a numeric entry in the fsckpass field.

       Specify  the  FSType on which to operate.  If -F FSType is
       not specified heuristics similiar to  those  used  by  are
       used to determine the file system type.  This command exe-
       cutes faster if it is not required to autodetect file sys-
       tem  types. If you are uncertain about the FSType, you can
       use the fstyp command to determine it.  Echo the  complete
       command line, but do not execute the command.  The command
       line is generated by using the options and arguments  pro-
       vided  by  the user and adding to them information derived
       from /etc/vfstab.  This option should be  used  to  verify
       and  validate  the command line.  Check but do not repair.
       This option checks that the  filesystem  is  suitable  for
       mounting.  Specify FSType-specific options.  Automatically

fsck(1M)                                                 fsck(1M)

       audits and interactively repairs  inconsistent  conditions
       for  all  filesystems  in /etc/vfstab in parallel. It uses
       the fsckpass field of /etc/vfstab  to  create  a  list  of
       filesystems  that  need  checking  on  separate disks. The
       filesystems are then scheduled for checking such that each
       disk  has  one  filesystem being checked on that disk at a
       given  time.   -P  supports  the   following   suboptions:
       Requests  that  the ouput is arranged in order by filesys-
       tem.  Prints the filesystem output in a brief  terse  for-
       mat.  Upon  success,  the  command  prints  one  line, per
       filesystem,  which  is  a  summary  of  fsck  information.
       Assumes  a "yes" response to all questions, and the inter-
       active mode is circumvented.   Averts  confusion  stemming
       from  several different filesystems requesting interactive
       responses. Runs as expected upon success  (either  verbose
       or  brief).  If it fails, the parent fsck process collects
       the failure information, but defers any corrections  until
       the rest of the filesystems have been checked.
