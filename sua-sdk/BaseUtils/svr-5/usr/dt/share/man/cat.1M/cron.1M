       The  cron  command starts a process that executes commands
       at specified dates and times.   Regularly  scheduled  com-
       mands  can be specified according to instructions found in
       crontab files in the  directory  /var/spool/cron/crontabs.
       Users  can  submit  their own crontab file via the crontab
       command.  Commands to be executed only once may be submit-
       ted via the at command.

       cron  normally  forks  itself  and  places itself into the
       background.  When the nofork  option  is  specified,  this
       initial  fork  is not performed.  This would allow cron to
       be started via inittab  rather  than  during  system  boot
       time.

       The  commands  are  not executed if, at the time of execu-
       tion, the requesting user ID or level ID has been deleted,
       or  if  the level is no longer a valid login level for the
       requesting user.

       cron only examines crontab files and at command files dur-
       ing process initialization and when a file changes via the
       crontab or at commands.   This  reduces  the  overhead  of
       checking  for  new or changed files at regularly scheduled
       intervals.

       Because cron never exits, it should be executed only once,
       normally  through  /etc/rc2.d/S75cron at system boot time.
       The file /etc/cron.d/LCK_CRON is used as a  lock  file  to
       prevent the execution of more than one cron.

       Use  the following files, described in to control cron: To
       specify whether cron is to log all actions, set CRONLOG to
       YES  or  to NO in /etc/default/cron.  cron usually creates
       huge log files.  Specify the number of concurrent jobs per
       user,  their  priority,  and  a retry interval in the file
       /etc/cron.d/queuedefs.

       /var/cron/log if logging is turned on.

       Changing  the  time of day clock on the system affects the
       execution of jobs specified  in  crontab  files.   If  the

       clock  is  moved ahead, the jobs scheduled for the skipped
       time interval will not be run.   If  the  clock  is  moved
       back, the jobs already executed in the time interval to be
       revisited will be run a second time.  Adjusting the system
       time  because  of standard or alternate time zone changes,
       including daylight time changes, causes this problem.
