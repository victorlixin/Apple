       syslogd reads and forwards system messages to  the  appro-
       priate log files and/or users, depending upon the priority
       of a message and the system facility from which it  origi-
       nates.   The configuration file /etc/syslog.conf (see con-
       trols where messages are forwarded.  syslogd logs  a  mark
       (timestamp) message every interval minutes (default 20) at
       priority LOG_INFO to the facility whose name is  given  as
       mark in the syslog.conf file.

       A  system message consists of a single line of text, which
       may be prefixed with a priority code  number  enclosed  in
       angle-brackets  (<>);  priorities  are defined in sys/sys-
       log.h.

       syslogd reads from the STREAMS log driver, /dev/log,  from
       any   transport   provider  specified  in  /etc/netconfig,
       /etc/net/transport/hosts, and /etc/net/transport/services.

       syslogd  reads  the  configuration file when it starts up,
       and again whenever it receives a HUP signal, at which time
       it also closes all files it has open, rereads its configu-
       ration file, and then opens only the log  files  that  are
       listed  in  that  file.   syslogd exits when it receives a
       TERM signal.

       As it starts up, syslogd creates the file /etc/syslog.pid,
       if possible, containing its process ID (PID).

       Turn  on  debugging.   Specify  an alternate configuration
       file.  Specify an interval, in minutes, between mark  mes-
       sages.    Specify   an   alternate  log  (one  other  than
       /dev/log).
