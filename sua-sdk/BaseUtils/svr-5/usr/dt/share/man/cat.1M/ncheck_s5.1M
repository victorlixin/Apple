       generic_options  are  options  supported  by  the  generic
       ncheck command.

       ncheck  generates  a  pathname versus i-number list of all
       files on the specified special device(s).  Names of direc-
       tory files are followed by /..

       The  options  are:  Specify the s5 FSType. If -F s5 is not
       specified heuristics similiar to those used by are used to
       determine  the  file  system  type.  This command executes
       faster if it is not required  to  autodetect  file  system
       types.  If possible, specify the -F s5.  Limits the report
       to those files whose i-numbers follow.  The i-numbers must
       be separated by commas without spaces.  Allows printing of
       the names and which are ordinarily suppressed.  Limits the
       report  to  special  files  and files with setuserid mode.
       This option may be used to detect violations  of  security
       policy.

       If  the filesystem structure is not consistent, ?? denotes
       the parent of a parentless file and a  pathname  beginning
       with ... denotes a loop.
