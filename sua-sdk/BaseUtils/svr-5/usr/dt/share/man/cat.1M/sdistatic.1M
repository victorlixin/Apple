       The  sdistatic  command  is used to save a snapshot of the
       current disk subsystem configuration (disks and paths), or
       to  compare  a saved configuration to the currently active
       configuration.

   OOppttiioonnss
       sdistatic takes one of the following options: Take a snap-
       shot of the current I/O subsystem configuration and use it
       as the saved configuration in all further  invocations  of
       sdistatic.   Compare  the current I/O subsystem configura-
       tion against the saved  configuration,  reporting  differ-
       ences  as  follows:  Paths to devices or the devices them-
       selves are missing.  The failure of a device  is  reported
       as  the failure of all paths to that device.  New paths or
       disks have been added.

       Prior  to  &uw710;,  the  sdistatic  command  allowed  the
       restoration  of a previously saved configuration with a -r
       option; this option is no longer supported as this  opera-
       tion is now performed automatically.
