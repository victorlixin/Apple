       labelit can be used to provide labels for  unmounted  disk
       filesystems or filesystems being copied to tape.

       generic_options  are  options  supported  by  the  generic
       labelit command.

       If neither fsname nor volume is specified, labelit  prints
       the current values.

       The  special name should be the physical disk section (for
       example, /dev/rdsk/*, where the value of * is machine spe-
       cific),  or  the cartridge tape (for example, /dev/rmt/*).
       The device may not be on a remote machine.

       The fsname argument represents the mounted name (for exam-
       ple, root, usr, and so on) of the filesystem.  fsname must
       be less than seven characters long.

       volume may be used to equate an internal name to a  volume
       name  applied  externally  to  the disk pack, diskette, or
       tape.  volume must be less than seven characters long.

       The options are: Specify the ufs FSType. If -F ufs is  not
       specified heuristics similiar to those used by are used to
       determine the file system  type.   This  command  executes
       faster  if  it  is  not required to autodetect file system
       types. If possible, specify  -F  ufs.   For  initial  tape
       labeling  only  (to prepare for This destroys the previous
       contents of the tape.

       Labeling a tape that already has a label will destroy  the
       tape's contents.
