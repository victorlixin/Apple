       bkhistory without options reports a summary  of  the  con-
       tents of the backup history log, bkhist.tab.  Backup oper-
       ations are sorted alphabetically by tag.   For  each  tag,
       operations  are listed from most to least recent.  updates
       this log after each successful backup operation.

       bkhistory may be executed only by a privileged user.

       bkhistory -p assigns a rotation period (in weeks) for  the
       history  log;  all entries older than the specified number
       of weeks are deleted from the log.  The  default  rotation
       period is one (1) week.

       Restricts the report to backup operations performed on the
       specified dates.  dates are  in  the  date  format.   day,
       hour, minute, and  year, are optional and will be ignored.
       The list of dates is either comma-separated or blank-sepa-
       rated  and surrounded by quotes.  Suppresses field wrap on
       the display and specifies an output field separator to  be
       used.  The value of c is the character that will appear as
       the field separator on the display output.  For clarity of
       output, do not use a separator character that is likely to
       occur in a field.  For example, do not use the colon as  a
       field  separator  character  if  the  display will contain
       dates that use a colon to separate hours from minutes.  To
       use  the  default  field separator (tab), specify the null
       character ("") for c.  Suppresses header for the  reports.
       Displays  a  long form of the report.  This produces an ls
       -l listing of the files included in the backup archive (if
       backup   tables   of   contents  are  available  on-line).
       Restricts the report to the specified originating  objects
       (file  systems  or  data  partitions).  names is a list of
       onames and/or odevices.  [See

       The list of names is either comma-separated or blank-sepa-
       rated  and surrounded by quotes.  Sets the number of weeks
       of information that will be saved in  the  backup  history
       table.   The  minimum  value of period is 1, which is also
       the default value.  the size of int.  By  default,  period
       is  1.  Restricts the report to backups with the specified
       tags.  tags is a list of tag values as  specified  in  the
       backup  register.   The list of tags is either comma-sepa-
       rated or blank-separated and surrounded by quotes.

       Example 1: bkhistory -p 3 sets the rotation period for the
       history  log  to  three  weeks.   Entries older than three
       weeks are deleted from the log.

       Example 2: bkhistory  -t  SpoolDai,UsrDaily,TPubsWed  dis-
       plays  a  report  of  completed  backup operations for the
       three tags listed.

       Example 3: bkhistory -l -o /usr Displays an ls -l  listing
       of  the files that were backed up from /usr (the originat-
       ing object) if there is a table of contents.
