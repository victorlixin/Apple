       generic_options are options supported by the generic mount
       command.   mount  attaches  a  profs  filesystem  to   the
       filesystem hierarchy at the pathname location mount_point,
       which must already exist.  If mount_point has any contents
       prior  to  the  mount operation, these remain hidden until
       the filesystem is once again unmounted.

       Specifies the profs-FSType.  Specify the profs  filesystem
       specific  options  in  a comma-separated list.  If invalid
       options are specified, a warning message  is  printed  and
       the invalid options are ignored.  Multiple filesystem-spe-
       cific options may be listed in any order, but must be sep-
       arated  by  commas.   The  following  option is available:
       Specifies the mode of the root directory  of  the  mounted
       file system. Default is 0755.

       If the directory on which a filesystem is to be mounted is
       a symbolic link, the filesystem is mounted on  the  direc-
       tory to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top
       of the symbolic link itself.

       mount_profs can be mounted on any  mount  point.  However,
       beginning  in Release 4.2 MP, the mount point is generally
       chosen to be /system/processor.
