       generic_options are options supported by  the  generic  df
       command.

       df  displays the amount of disk space occupied by ufs file
       systems, the amount of used and available space,  and  how
       much of the file system's total capacity has been used.

       Note  that the amount of space reported as used and avail-
       able is less than the amount of space in the file  system;
       this  is  because  the  system  reserves a fraction of the
       space in the file system to allow its file system  alloca-
       tion  routines to work well.  The amount reserved is typi-
       cally about 10%; this may be adjusted using When  all  the
       space  on  the  file  system except for this reserve is in
       use, only a privileged user can  allocate  new  files  and
       data  blocks  to  existing files.  When the file system is
       overallocated in this way, df may  report  that  the  file
       system is more than 100% utilized.

       Specifies  the  ufs-FSType.   File  system  types  can  be
       autodetected so in principle  this  option  is  no  longer
       required.  However,  df executes faster if the file system
       type is specifed rather than having  to  be  autodetected.
       Specify  ufs  file system specific options.  The available
       option is: Report the number of used and free inodes.  May
       not be used with generic_options.

       df  calculates  its  results  differently  for mounted and
       unmounted file  systems.   For  mounted  systems  the  10%
       reserved  space  mentioned above is included in the number
       of blocks used.  For unmounted systems the 10% reservation
       is  not included in the number of blocks used. The generic
       -k option displays the free space as a percentage.

       The -b and -e options override the -t option.
