       In  a multipath I/O environment (see there can be multiple
       paths to any single disk. The name for the disk is  deter-
       mined  by  the  first  path discovered to the disk.  Ghost
       Names are provided so that a disk can  still  be  accessed
       when  that  disk  is  no longer accessible at the original
       device node  address,  but  is  still  accessible  through
       another path.

       For  example,  when you move a disk from one controller to
       another, the disk obtains a new address. The  old  address
       is  retained  as  a  Ghost  Name, and a mapping is created
       between the old address and the new address.  The original
       device node names do not change.

       In this case, the Ghost Name is used for making the device
       nodes so that: the filesystems residing on  the  disk  are
       mounted   automatically  without  making  any  changes  to
       filesystem tables the disk remains accessible to  applica-
       tions that use the original device nodes

       Note  that,  once  a  disk is moved from one controller to
       another, it occupies two addresses. A new disk  cannot  be
       added  at  the  old  address  until  the  name  mapping is
       removed.  sdighost is used to remove the associated  Ghost
       Name, and so clear the mapping.

       sdighost  reads  the  device table and lists all the disks
       together with any associated Ghost Names.  The  -r  option
       removes  all  the  Ghost  Name  entries  and recreates the
       device nodes based on the old addresses  of  the  devices.
       The  system  must  be  rebooted  after  any  use of the -r
       option.

       A record of Ghost Names from invocation to  invocation  is
       kept  in  /etc/device.tab.   Initially, when a new disk is
       found, no Ghost Name is assigned, and the device nodes are
       created based on its real address.

       If  the  device  returns  to its original address then the
       associated Ghost Name is removed.

       sdighost takes the following options: Lists all the  disks
       and  any  Ghost Names.  Removes the Ghost Names in use and
       recreates the device nodes based on the real addresses.  A
       system reboot is required after use of -r.
