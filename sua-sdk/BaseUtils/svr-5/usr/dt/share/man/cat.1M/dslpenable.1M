       The dslpenable  and  dslpdisable  utilities  are  used  to
       enable  or  disable  a  print  queue from processing print
       requests that have been queued  for  it.  Unlike  the  and
       utilities,  the  directory-enabled  utilities  can control
       remote print systems,  so  long  as  they  are  directory-
       enabled.  This is because they write directly to the print
       queue object on the directory server.

       The print-queue-name parameter is the  RDN  of  the  print
       queue.  This could be a list of print queues. If the print
       queue name does not exist in the directory context (as set
       by the -C option), the command fails.

       The  user  of  this  utility must be directory-enabled and
       have permissions set for write, modify, search and read on
       the  directory, in the directory context in which they are
       administrator.

       The directory-context  argument  specifies  the  directory
       context  for  which the command is valid. For example, the
       command changes the status of the print  queue  whose  RDN
       has  been  specified by the print-queue-name in the direc-
       tory context. If the -C option is not given,  the  current
       directory  context  is  used.   Assign the reason for dis-
       abling the  print  queue.  Strings  containing  whitespace
       should be double quoted.

       This  is  a  string  that  is displayed by the command. No
       default reason is set when one is not specified.

       one  of  the  following  exit  codes  is returned: invalid
