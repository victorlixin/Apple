       isdndialer  is  an  ISDN dialer program.  It is invoked by
       the connection server, when a call is made  from  an  ISDN
       device,  and  it establishes outgoing connections based on
       the contents of the files.  It can only be used when  ISDN
       devices are installed in the system and are configured for
       outgoing calls.

       isdndialer should only be  controlled  by  the  connection
       server; it should not be invoked from the command line.

       isdndialer  can be used to troubleshoot suspected problems
       with outgoing ISDN calls.  To do so, you must  create  log
       files  before  making  further  calls.  For example: touch
       /var/adm/log/isdndialer.log   touch   /var/adm/log/isdndi-
       aler.debug  These  files  are created in the /var/adm/log/
       directory: contains a list of each outgoing call  contains
       detailed  information  about each outgoing call isdndialer
       log files are cumulative and grow rapidly.  If you plan to
       use  them  for  extended periods of time, you should clean
       them out regularly with jobs.
