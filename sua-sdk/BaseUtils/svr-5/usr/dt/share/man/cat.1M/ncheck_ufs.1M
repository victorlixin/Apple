       generic_options  are  options  supported  by  the  generic
       ncheck command.

       ncheck  generates a pathname versus i-number list of files
       for the ufs filesystem.  Names of directory files are fol-
       lowed by /..

       The  options are: Specify the ufs FSType. If -F ufs is not
       specified heuristics similiar to those used by are used to
       determine  the  file  system  type.  This command executes
       faster if it is not required  to  autodetect  file  system
       types. If possible, specify the -F ufs.  Limits the report
       to the files on the i-list that follows.  The i-list  must
       be separated by commas without spaces.  Allows printing of
       the names . and .., which are ordinarily suppressed.  Lim-
       its the report to special files and files with set-user-ID
       mode.  This option may be used  to  detect  violations  of
       security policy.  Specify ufs filesystem specific options.
       The available option is: Print mode information.

       When the filesystem structure is improper, ?? denotes  the
       ``parent''  of  a parentless file and a pathname beginning
       with ... denotes a loop.
