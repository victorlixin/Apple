       rlpconf  configures remote line printers that use the com-
       mand to send their requests to a printer on a remote host.
       It  is  recommended  that the rlp commands are not used in
       &geminiREL; as the  same  functionality  can  be  achieved
       using  the standard lp commands.  rlpconf is used interac-
       tively. The user is prompted to provide information  about
       the  printer,  such as the local printer name, the name of
       the remote host that the printer is attached to,  and  the
       name of the printer on the remote host.

       rlpconf  asks if the printer is the system default. If the
       printer     is     to     be     the     default,     then
       /usr/spool/lp/admins/lp/default  is  updated with the name
       of the printer.

       The configuration information indicating the name  of  the
       printer  is  stored in a file called configuration located
       in  a  subdirectory  bearing  the  printer's  name   under
       /usr/spool/lp/admins/lp/printers/*/configuration.      The
       local   to   remote   printer   mapping   is   stored   in
       /usr/spool/lp/remote.

       The  lp  user on the remote printer's host must be config-
       ured to allow the client to have trusted lp user access to
       it (/usr/spool/lp/.rhosts).
