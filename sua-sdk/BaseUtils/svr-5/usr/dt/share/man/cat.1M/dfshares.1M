       The generic dfshares command  provides  information  about
       resources  available  to  the  host  through a distributed
       filesystem of type fstype.

       dfshares prints a header line, followed by a list of lines
       containing whitespace-separated fields.

       For  each resource, the fields are: resource server access
       transport description where Specifies  the  resource  name
       that  must be given to the command.  Specifies the name of
       the system that is making the resource available.   Speci-
       fies the access permissions granted to the client systems,
       either ro (for  read-only)  or  rw  (for  read/write).  If
       dfshares cannot determine access permissions, a hyphen (-)
       is displayed.  Specifies the transport provider over which
       the  resource  is  shared.   Describes  the resource. This
       field is not printed for all filesystem  types.   A  field
       may  be NULL. Each NULL field is indicated by a hyphen (-)
       unless the remainder of the fields on the  line  are  also
       NULL. In this case, it may be omitted.

       The  following  options are available to the dfshares com-
       mand: Specifies the filesystem type. If this option is not
       specified,   the  first  filesystem  type  listed  in  the
       /etc/dfs/fstypes file is used.  Suppress the  header  line
       in  the  output of dfshares.  Depends upon the distributed
       filesystem  (fstype)  being  used.  For  a  list  of  spe-
       cific_options,  refer to the documentation on the filesys-
       tem type being used.  Specifies a server  whose  available
       resources  are to be listed.  If dfshares is entered with-
       out arguments, all resources currently shared on the local
       system, along with resources that are available for mount-
       ing, are displayed, regardless of filesystem type.
