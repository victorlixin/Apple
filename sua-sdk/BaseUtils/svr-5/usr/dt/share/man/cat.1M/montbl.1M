       The  montbl  command  takes as input a specification file,
       infile, that describes the formatting conventions for mon-
       etary  quantities for a specific locale.  Write the output
       on outfile; otherwise, write the output on  a  file  named
       LC_MONETARY.   The output of montbl is suitable for use by
       the localeconv function (see Before outfile can be used by
       localeconv,     it    must    be    installed    in    the
       /usr/lib/locale/locale directory with the name LC_MONETARY
       by  a user with appropriate privilege or a member of group
       bin.  locale is the locale whose monetary formatting  con-
       ventions are described in infile.  This file must be read-
       able by user,  group,  and  other;  no  other  permissions
       should be set.  To use formatting conventions for monetary
       quantities described in  this  file,  use  to  change  the
       locale for category LC_MONETARY to locale (see

       Once  installed,  this file will be used by the localeconv
       function to initialize the monetary specific fields  of  a
       structure of type struct lconv.  For a description of each
       field  in  this  structure,  see  struct     lconv       {
            char   *decimal_point;        /*   "."  */       char
       *thousands_sep;          /* ""  (zero  length  string)  */

       int_frac_digits;         /*    CHAR_MAX    */         char
       frac_digits;        /*     CHAR_MAX      */           char
       p_cs_precedes;      /*      CHAR_MAX      */          char
       p_sep_by_space;          /*    CHAR_MAX    */         char
       n_cs_precedes;      /*      CHAR_MAX      */          char

       n_sign_posn;        /* CHAR_MAX */  };  The  specification
       file  specifies  the  value  of  each struct lconv member,
       except for the first three members,  decimal_point,  thou-
       sands_sep,  and  grouping, which are set by the LC_NUMERIC
       category of Each member's value is given on  a  line  with
       the  following  format:  keyword <white space> value where
       keyword is identical to the struct lconv  field  name  and
       value is a quoted string for those fields that are a char-
       acter pointer and an integer for those fields that hold an
       integer           value.            For           example,
       int_curr_symbol          "ITL."
       int_frac_digits          0 will set the international cur-
       rency symbol and the number of  fractional  digits  to  be

       displayed  in  an internationally formatted monetary quan-
       tity to ITL. and 0, respectively.

       Blank lines and lines starting with a # are  taken  to  be
       comments  and are ignored.  A character in a string may be
       in octal or hex representation.  For example, \141 or \x61
       could  be  used to represent the letter a.  If there is no
       specification line for a given structure member, then  the
       default  C  locale  value for that member is used (see the
       values in comments in the struct lconv definition  above).

       Given  below  is an example of what the specification file
       for Italy would look like: # Italy

       int_curr_symbol          "ITL."
       currency_symbol          "L."       mon_decimal_point   ""
       mon_thousands_sep   "."           mon_grouping        "\3"
       positive_sign       ""             negative_sign       "-"
       int_frac_digits          0           frac_digits         0
       p_cs_precedes       1                p_sep_by_space      0
       n_cs_precedes       1                n_sep_by_space      0
       p_sign_posn         1 n_sign_posn         1

       The  first  three  elements  of the lconv structure, deci-
       mal_point, thousand_sep,  and  grouping  are  set  by  the
       LC_NUMERIC category of The utility can be used to generate
       the LC_NUMERIC data containing this information.
