       mkfs constructs a filesystem by  writing  on  the  special
       file;  special must be the first argument.  The filesystem
       is created  based  on  the  FSType,  specific_options  and
       operands  specified  on  the  command line.  mkfs waits 10
       seconds before starting to construct the filesystem.  Dur-
       ing  this  time  the  command can be aborted by entering a
       delete ().

       operands are FSType-specific and the FSType specific  man-
       ual  page  of  mkfs  should  be  consulted  for a detailed
       description.

       current_options are options supported by  the  s5-specific
       module  of mkfs.  Other FSTypes do not necessarily support
       these options.  specific_options indicate suboptions spec-
       ified  in a comma-separated list of suboptions and/or key-
       word-attribute pairs for interpretation by the FSType-spe-
       cific module of the command.

       The  options  are:  Specify  the FSType to be constructed.
       The FSType should either be specified here  or  be  deter-
       minable  from  /etc/vfstab by matching the special with an
       entry in the table.  Echo the complete command  line,  but
       do not execute the command.  The command line is generated
       by using the options and arguments provided  by  the  user
       and  adding  to them information derived from /etc/vfstab.
       This option should be used to verify and validate the com-
       mand line.  Return the command line which was used to cre-
       ate the filesystem.  The filesystem  must  already  exist.
       This  option  provides  a means of determining the command
       used in constructing the filesystem.  It  cannot  be  used
       with  current_options,  specific_options, or operands.  It
       must  be  invoked  by  itself.   Specify   FSType-specific
       options.   mkfs  constructs a filesystem by writing on the
       special file.  Specify the number of logical 512 byte sec-
       tors  in  the  filesystem.  The largest filesystem size is
       determined by the FSType.

       This command may  not  be  supported  for  all  filesystem
       types.   For example, mounting an memfs filesystem creates
       an instantiation of the filesystem.  Therefore,  the  mkfs
       command is not required for that filesystem type.

                                                                1

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
