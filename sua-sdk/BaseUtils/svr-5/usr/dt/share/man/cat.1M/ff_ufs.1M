       generic_options  are  options  supported by the generic ff
       command.

       ff reads the i-list and directories of the  special  file,
       assuming  it  is  a  filesystem.   Inode data is saved for
       files which match the selection criteria.  Output consists
       of  the  pathname  for  each  saved inode, plus other file
       information requested using  the  options  below.   Output
       fields  are  positional.   The output is produced in inode
       order;  fields  are  separated  by  TAB  characters.   The
       default line produced by ff is: path-name i-number

       Specify  the  ufs-FSType. If -F FSType is not specified it
       is determined by matching the special  with  an  entry  in
       /etc/vfstab.   If this fails, heuristics similiar to those
       used by are used to determine the file  system  type.   If
       the  FSType  is  known beforehand, use the -F option. This
       command executes faster if it is not required  to  autode-
       tect  file  system  types.  Do not print the i-node number
       after each pathname.  Generate a supplementary list of all
       pathnames for multiply-linked files.  The specified prefix
       is added to each generated pathname.   The  default  is  .
       (dot).   Print  the  file size, in bytes, after each path-
       name.  Print the owner's login name after  each  pathname.
       Select  if the i-node has been accessed in n days.  Select
       if the i-node has been modified in n days.  Select if  the
       i-node  has  been changed in n days.  Select if the i-node
       has been modified more recently than  the  argument  file.
       Generate names for only those i-nodes specified in i-node-
       list.  i-node-list is a list of numbers separated by  com-
       mas  and  without spaces.  Specify ufs filesystem specific
       options.  The options  available  are:  Print  the  .  and
       directory  entries.   Print  mode information.  Print only
       special files and files with set-user-ID mode.

       If the -l option is not specified, only a single  pathname
       out  of  all  possible  ones  is generated for a multiply-
       linked inode.  If -l is specified, all possible names  for
       every  linked  file  on the filesystem are included in the
       output.  However, no selection criteria apply to the names
       generated.

                                                                1
