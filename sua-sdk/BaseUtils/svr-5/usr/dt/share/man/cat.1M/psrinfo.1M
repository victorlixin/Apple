       The  psrinfo  command  displays processor information on a
       multiprocessor system.  It is used by  system  administra-
       tors and operators to examine the administrative state and
       other information about the specified processor(s).  If no
       processor  is  specified, information about all processors
       is written to standard output.   The  processor_id  is  an
       integer that uniquely identifies a processor.

       The  options  are:  enable  verbose  mode.   write  only a
       boolean value for the status to standard output.  For  use
       in  scripts.   A value of 1 is written if the processor is
       online in an unlocked administrative state, and 0 if it is
       offline  in  a  locked administrative state.  displays the
       number  of  processors.   Default   output:   processor_id
       online    since  MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS processor_id     online
       since MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS  processor_id      offline   since
       MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS processor_id     offline  since MM/DD/YY
       HH:MM:SS
         . . .  processor_id     online   since MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS

       When  verbose  mode  is specified, the following format is
       used for each processor.  Status of processor processor_id
       as of:  MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS
         Processor   has   been   [on|off]-line   since  MM/DD/YY
       HH:MM:SS.
         The [<i386>] processor [has an <i387>|has  no]  floating
       point
            processor.
         The following conditions exist:
               Device  drivers are [not] bound to this processor.
       Where choices are shown here, only the appropriate wording
       is  displayed in normal usage.  When information cannot be
       determined, the word UNKNOWN is displayed.
