       The idmknodd daemon is introduced in &geminiREL; to update
       the  special  device  files under the /dev directory.  For
       drivers written for DDI version 8 and later, device  files
       are  created and removed dynamically as needed, to support
       the hotplug functionality.

       Install nodes in (or remove them from) the directory spec-
       ified  rather  than  the default, /dev.  Use the directory
       specified, instead of /etc/conf, as the root of  the  con-
       figuration data directories.  Print debugging information.
