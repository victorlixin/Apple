       mccntl sends the optional commands to the  medium  changer
       device driver sub-device /dev/mc/mc*.

       mccntl  accepts the following options: Eject the currently
       loaded media.  The media is returned to the  slot  it  was
       loaded  from.  The functionality of this command is depen-
       dent on not using the changer's front panel  controls  for
       positioning  or  loading/unloading  media.   If  the front
       panel controls are used, the driver will not  be  able  to
       determine  which slot the media was loaded from.  Load the
       media from element into the data drive.  Eject  the  media
       currently loaded in the data drive into the specified ele-
       ment.  Eject the media currently loaded in the data  drive
       into  the  slot  from  which  it was loaded, then load the
       media currently in the specified  element  into  the  data
       drive.   Perform  the  requested  operation  on the medium
       changer raw-device.  raw-device is the medium changer spe-
       cial device node, and defaults to /dev/mc/mc1 if not spec-
       ified.  There exists one device node in /dev/mc  for  each
       medium  changer  attached  to  the system.  Initialize the
       medium changer status.  This will cause the medium changer
       to check all elements for medium and any other status rel-
       evant to that element.  Display the number of slots in the
       currently loaded magazine.  Display the medium changer and
       data drive status.  Disable removal  of  media  via  front
       panel  controls.   Allow  removal of media via front panel
       controls.  Dump the configuration status  map.  This  will
       generate  a  colon-separated  list  describing the current
       configuration.  Return to the first  filled  element.   If
       the drive is loaded, this will unload the currently loaded
       cartridge to  the  currently  positioned  source  element.
       Then  the  cartridge in the lowest numbered source element
       that contains a cartridge will be loaded.
