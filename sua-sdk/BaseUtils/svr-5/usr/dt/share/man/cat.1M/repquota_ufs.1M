       generic_options  are  options  supported  by  the  generic
       repquota command.

       repquota prints a summary of the disk usage and quotas for
       the specified filesystems.  For each user the current num-
       ber  of  files  and  amount  of  space  (in  kilobytes) is
       printed, along with any quotas created with edquota.

       An error message is returned if  you  run  repquota  on  a
       filesystem  that  does  not have a quotas file in the root
       directory.

       Report on all filesystems that have ``rq'' in the  mntopts
       field of the /etc/vfstab file.  Report all quotas, even if
       there is no usage.  Only privileged users may view  quotas
       which are not their own.
