       generic_options  are options supported by the generic fsck
       command.

       Specify the dosfs FSType. If -F  dosfs  is  not  specified
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the file system type.  This command executes faster if  it
       is not required to autodetect file system types. If possi-
       ble, specify -F dosfs.  Assume a yes response to all ques-
       tions  asked  by  fsck.  Assume a no response to all ques-
       tions asked by fsck.  Sanity checking  only.   The  dosfs-
       specific  fsck  command  checks  that  the File Allocation
       Tables (FATs) are readable. At least one FAT must be read-
       able for fsck to proceed.

       The  dosfs-specific  fsck command checks for the following
       inconsistencies: Backup copies of the FAT are not in  sync
       with  the  first copy of the FAT.  Allocation units (clus-
       ters) claimed by more  than  one  directory  entry.   Lost
       clusters  (that  is, clusters not claimed by any directory
       entry but still marked in  use  in  the  FAT).   Directory
       entries  pointing  to  cluster  numbers out of range.  FAT
       entries in the FAT pointing  to  cluster  numbers  out  of
       range.   Start cluster number of ``..'' not matching start
       cluster number of parent directory.  Start cluster  number
       of  ``.''  not  matching  start  cluster number of current
       directory.  For directories, file size not being set  cor-
       rectly  to  zero.   For regular files, file size set to an
       incorrect byte count.  For long name entries:  check  that
       the  sequence  numbers  of  the entries are in order check
       that the checksum of all entries are the same  check  that
       there is an alias entry with the same checksum
