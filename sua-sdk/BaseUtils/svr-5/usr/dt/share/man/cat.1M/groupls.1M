       Without arguments, the groupls command generates a list of
       groups the user belongs to.  The user syntax also allows a
       list of usernames to be specified.

       The  following  options   are   supported:   Outputs   all
       attributes associated with the specified group accounts to
       standard output in extended option syntax (parsable from a
       datafile  using  the -X option).  Displays groups accounts
       with duplicate IDs.   Reports  all  attributes  associated
       with group group_name.  Causes displayed information to be
       delimited with colons (:).  Lists extended  group  account
       attributes.  Most attributes are group parameters that can
       be changed; the groupls command can only be used to  query
       them.   See for a list of group account attributes.  Spec-
       ify the file from which the group  attributes  are  to  be
       taken.   If  group  is  preceded by a ``+'', (for example,
       ``+student''), the group definition is administered by the
       Network Information Service (NIS). In this case, the value
       for group ID will be taken from the NIS database.
