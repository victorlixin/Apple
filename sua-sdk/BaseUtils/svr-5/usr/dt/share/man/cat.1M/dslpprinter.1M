       The  dslpprinter utility is used, by either an administra-
       tor or a directory-enabled  user, to assign an alias to  a
       print  queue  DN.   It  can also be used to set up default
       printers for a user, either at a location that is specific
       to  the  current  directory  context,  or  as  an anywhere
       default. A default, set for the user's  current  directory
       context  location,  always  takes precedence over the any-
       where default.  A print queue's alias  name  can  be  used
       instead of its real name.

       The  print-queue-dn  argument is the print queue DN to use
       for this alias name or default print queue.

       The user of this utility  must  be  directory-enabled  and
       have permissions set for write, modify, search and read on
       the directory object that is being modified.

       The following command line options  are  supported:  A  DN
       that specifies the location, in terms of directory context
       DN, for which the alias name is valid. It defaults to  the
       current  directory  context.  A DN that specifies the user
       or container object to which the alias  is  to  be  added.
       Defaults  to the current login user.  The alias name to be
       allocated to the specified print queue.  Remove the  alias
       name  or  default  print  queues from the object.  Set the
       specified print queue as the default  for  this  location.
       Set the default print queue for location anywhere.
