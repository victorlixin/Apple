       generic_options  are options supported by the generic quo-
       tacheck command.

       quotacheck examines each filesystem,  builds  a  table  of
       current  disk  usage, and compares this table against that
       stored in the disk quota file for the filesystem.  If  any
       inconsistencies  are detected, both the quota file and the
       current system copy of the incorrect  quotas  are  updated
       (the  latter  only  occurs  if  an  active  filesystem  is
       checked).

       quotacheck expects each filesystem to be checked to have a
       quota file named quotas in the root directory.  If none is
       present, quotacheck will ignore the filesystem.

       quotacheck accesses the character special device in calcu-
       lating  the  actual  disk  usage for each user.  Thus, the
       filesystems checked should be quiescent  while  quotacheck
       is running.

       Specify the ufs FSType. If -F ufs is not specified heuris-
       tics similiar to those used by are used to  determine  the
       file  system  type.  This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify  the  -F ufs.  Indicate the calculated disk quotas
       for each user on a particular filesystem.  quotacheck nor-
       mally  reports  only  those  quotas  modified.   Check the
       filesystems indicated in  /etc/mnttab  to  be  read-write.
       Only  those  filesystems that have rq in the mntopts field
       of the /etc/vfstab file are checked.  Run parallel  passes
       on the required filesystems.
