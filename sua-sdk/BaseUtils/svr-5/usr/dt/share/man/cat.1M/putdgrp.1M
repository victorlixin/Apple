       putdgrp  modifies  the  device group table.  It can modify
       the table by creating a new device group or by removing  a
       device  group.   It  can  also change group definitions by
       adding or removing a device from the group definition.

       The options for putdgrp are: Delete the group or, if  used
       with  device, the device from a group definition.  Specify
       a device group name.  Specify the pathname or alias of the
       device  that  is  to  added  to or deleted from the device
       group.

       When putdgrp is executed with only a dgroup specification,
       the  command  adds  the specified group name to the device
       group table if it does  not  already  exist.   If  the  -d
       option  is  also  used with only the dgroup specification,
       the command deletes the group from the table.

       When putdgrp is executed with both a dgroup and  a  device
       specification, it adds the given device name (or names) to
       the group definition.  When invoked  with  both  arguments
       and the -d option, the command deletes the device name (or
       names) from the group definition.

       When putdgrp is executed with both a dgroup and  a  device
       specification and the device group does not exist, it cre-
       ates the group and adds the specified devices to that  new
       group.

       On  success,  putdgrp exits with the value 0.  On failure,
       it exits with one of the following values: Command  syntax
       incorrect,   invalid   option   used,  or  internal  error
       occurred.  Device group table  could  not  be  opened  for
       reading  or a new device group table could not be created.
       If executed with the -d option, indicates that an entry in
       the  device  group  table for the device group dgroup does
       not exist and so cannot be deleted.  Otherwise,  indicates
       that  the device group dgroup already exists and cannot be
       added.  If executed with the -d option, indicates that the
       device  group  dgroup does not have as members one or more
       of the specified devices.  Otherwise, indicates  that  the
       device  group dgroup already has one or more of the speci-
       fied devices as members.
