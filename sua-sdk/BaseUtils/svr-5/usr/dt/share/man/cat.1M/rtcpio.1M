       The  rtcpio command allows operators to backup and restore
       user files while denying the operators access to  adminis-
       trative  files.   The  rtcpio command calls the tcpio com-
       mand, restricting the level range of files to be backed up
       and restored.

       If  the  user  does  not specify a level range with the -X
       option,  rtcpio  calls  tcpio  with  the  range  USER_PUB-
       LIC,USER_LOGIN  specified  as the default arguments to the
       -X option.

       If the user specifies a level range with  the  -X  option,
       the  specified range is compared to the allowed range.  If
       the specified range is not within the  allowed  range,  an
       error  message  is displayed and no files are backed up or
       restored.  If the specified range is  within  the  allowed
       range, rtcpio calls tcpio, passing on the arguments to the
       -X option unchanged.

       All other options and arguments specified by the user  are
       passed  on unchanged to tcpio, whether or not -X is speci-
       fied.

       The full description of the -X  option  is:  Extract  only
       files  with  MAC  level  between low_level and high_level,
       inclusive.  high_level must dominate low_level.  In  addi-
       tion,  the  range  specified  must be within the permitted
       range; low_level must dominate USER_PUBLIC and  high_level
       must  be dominated by USER_LOGIN.  LIDs, aliases, or fully
       qualified level names may be used to specify low_level and
       high_level.   Only  valid  names or aliases may be used; a
       LID may be used even if it has been  deleted.   All  other
       options  are  passed  unchanged  to tcpio.  See the manual
       page for a full description of these options.
