       lpsched allows you to start the LP print service.

       lpshut  shuts  down  the print service.  All printers that
       are printing at the  time  lpshut  is  invoked  will  stop
       printing.   When  lpsched  is started again, requests that
       were printing at the time a printer was shut down will  be
       reprinted from the beginning.

       You  must  have  the appropriate privilege (lp or root) to
       run these commands.

       If the scheduler fails to run, check the lpsched log  file
       which contains all failed attempts to load print requests,
       printer descriptions, forms, filters, classes, alerts, and
       systems.  The log files are located in /var/lp/logs.  Use-
       ful information on the networked print service can also be
       found in the log file /var/lp/logs/lpNet.
