       mvdir moves directories within a filesystem.  dirname must
       be a directory.  If name does not exist, it will  be  cre-
       ated  as a directory.  If name does exist, and is a direc-
       tory, dirname will be created  as  name/dirname.   dirname
       and name may not be on the same path; that is, one may not
       be subordinate to the other.  For example: mvdir  x/y  x/z
       is legal, but mvdir x/y x/y/z is not.
