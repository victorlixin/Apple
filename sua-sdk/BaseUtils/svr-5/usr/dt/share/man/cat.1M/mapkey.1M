       mapscrn  configures the output mapping of the virtual ter-
       minal screen on which it is invoked.   mapkey  and  mapstr
       configure the mapping of the keyboard and string keys (for
       example, function keys) of the virtual  terminal.   mapkey
       can only be run by the privileged user.

       mapscrn and mapstr function on a per-virtual terminal (VT)
       basis.  Mapping on one VT does not affect  any  other  VT.
       Setting  the default for every VT can be done using the -g
       option.  The -g option may be used only by the  privileged
       user.

       The mapscrn command sets up a one-to-one character mapping
       on output.  This is also known  as  the  "screen  mapping"
       capability.  A screen map is an array of 256 bytes (eight-
       bit characters). If a character is  written  to  a  VT  on
       which  screen  mapping  is enabled, the character actually
       drawn on the screen is going to be the  character  in  the
       array  at the index value given by the original character.

       For example, char foo[256] is the screen map.   foo[a]  is
       set  to  the  value p. If the screen map foo is enabled on
       the VT, every time the character a is written to the  ter-
       minal, p will be displayed.

       If  a file name is given on the argument line, the respec-
       tive mapping table is configured from the contents of  the
       input  file.   If  no  file is given, the default files in
       /usr/lib/keyboard and /usr/lib/console are used.   The  -d
       option causes the mapping table to be read from the kernel
       instead of written and an ASCII version to be displayed on
       the standard output.  The format of the output is suitable
       for use as input files to mapscrn, mapkey, or mapstr.

       The sum of the characters in the strings  for  mapstr  (in
       the  /usr/lib/keyboard/strings  file)  can be a maximum of
       512.

       mapkey, when downloading a mapping table,  overwrites  the
       default  mapping table for all VTs (thus affecting all VTs
       using the default mapping table) unless the -V  option  is
       specified.   In  this case, only the VT in which mapkey -V
       was invoked is affected, and the VT will revert  to  using
       the  default  mapping  table when it is closed or the user
       logs out.

                                                                1

mapkey(1M)                                             mapkey(1M)

       When mapkey displays the mapping table being used,  it  is
       the  default  mapping table unless the -V option is speci-
       fied.  In this case, mapkey displays the mapping table  in
       use  on  the  VT  in  which mapkey -V was invoked.  The -S
       option invokes  the    keyboard  mapping;  the  -U  option
       invokes the system keyboard mapping.

       Non-privileged users can run mapkey and mapstr when the -d
       option is given.

       With the -o or -x options,  mapkey  displays  the  mapping
       table in octal or hexadecimal, respectively.
