       ppplinkdrop drops a link from a PPP bundle by passing  the
       specified bundle and optional link to the PPP daemon, (The
       bundle and link must have been previously configured using
       pppd  looks up the bundle and link names, and then removes
       the link from the bundle.  If a link name  is  not  speci-
       fied, pppd selects a pre-configured link in the bundle.

       In  default  synchronous mode, ppplinkdrop does not return
       to the  shell  prompt  until  either  the  link  has  been
       dropped, or a timeout has occurred.

       The  following  options are available: Select asynchronous
       mode. In this mode, pppattach sends a linkdrop command  to
       pppd,  and  then exits without monitoring the state of the
       bundle.  The status of the bundle is checked every  period
       seconds  to  verify  if  the bundle is usable.  In verbose
       mode, the on-screen status is also updated.  Set the time-
       out  value  for  dropping  the  link.  The default timeout
       value is 120 seconds.  A timeout value of 0 may  cause  an
       indefinite  wait if the link is not dropped.  Turn on ver-
       bose mode. In this mode, status information for  the  bun-
       dle,  bundle  protocols  and  link  protocols will be dis-
       played.

       In verbose mode, the  state  of  links  are  displayed  on
       screen.  If  a link has been specified then information on
       that link only will be displayed  along  with  bundle  and
       link protocol information. If a link is not specified then
       information on links will be shown up to the  point  where
       the  information  would  overflow  the screen. For systems
       using high numbers of links within a single bundle, use to
       provide full information about all links.

       In  synchronous mode, the following exit codes can be used
       to diagnose problems with dropping the link: Link  dropped
       successful.   Unable  to  drop link because the command or
       its arguments are invalid.  Unable to  drop  link  because
       the  bundle  name  is invalid.  Unable to drop link within
       the specified timeout value (note that link  establishment
       may  still be in progress, even though pppattach has timed
       out and returned to the shell  prompt).   Unable  to  drop
       link due to an unexpected error from pppd.  Unable to drop
       link  due  to  a  dialer  error.   An  unspecified   error
       occurred.

                                                                1
