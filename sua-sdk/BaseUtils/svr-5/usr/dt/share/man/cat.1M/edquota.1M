       edquota is a quota editor.  One or more users may be spec-
       ified on the command line.  For each user a temporary file
       is created with an ASCII  representation  of  the  current
       disk  quotas  for  that  user for each mounted file system
       that has a quotas file, and an editor is then  invoked  on
       the  file.   The  quotas  may then be modified, new quotas
       added, and so on.  Upon leaving the editor, edquota  reads
       the  temporary file and modifies the binary quota files to
       reflect the changes made.

       The editor invoked is unless the EDITOR environment  vari-
       able specifies otherwise.

       edquota  is supported on the ufs and vxfs FStypes.  Only a
       privileged user may edit quotas.

       In order for quotas to be established on  a  file  system,
       the root directory of the file system must contain a file,
       owned by root, called quotas.  See for details.

       Specify the FSType on which to operate.  If -F  FSType  is
       not  specified  it  is  determined by matching the inputfs
       device with an  entry  in  /etc/vfstab.   If  this  fails,
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the file system type.  If the FSType is known  beforehand,
       use  the  -F option. This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system  types.   Echo  the
       complete  command  line,  but  do not execute the command.
       The command line is generated by  using  the  options  and
       arguments provided by the user and adding to them informa-
       tion derived from /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used
       to  verify and validate the command line.  Specify FSType-
       specific options.
