       The  pkginstall  command  provides a software installation
       mechanism within a distributed TCP/IP network.  This  com-
       mand  is  typically  used  after  software  is staged on a
       UnixWare Install Server.  For details, see or  the  manual
       page for

       turns   on  verbose  output  mode  and  causes  additional
       description of pkginstall events  to  be  written  to  the
       /var/sadm/dist/log log file.  Specifies  (default).  Spec-
       ifies non-interactive mode.  By default, interactive  mode
       is  used.   If  the installation requires user interaction
       while running in non-interactive  mode,  the  installation
       halts.   See  for  details.  specifies the software source
       for the copy.  The  format  for  the  source  location  is
       either:

       host:[device] or [host]:device

       where:  is  the  name or Internet address (IP) of the host
       where the package(s) to be distributed  reside  (that  is,
       the  IP  address  of  the  Install Server).  When the host
       argument is omitted, the  local  host  (the  system  where
       pkginstall  is  invoked) is assumed.  indicates the device
       or directory where  the  software  that  is  being  copied
       resides.  Alternatively, the device argument may be a file
       containing a data stream in pkgadd format.  The full  path
       name  of  the  device (for example, /dev/rmt/c0s0), direc-
       tory, or file must be used.  lists the software package to
       be distributed, where package is the package short package
       name as returned by the command.

       If the source directory is a  directory  containing  pack-
       age(s),  then you must specify the package option.  If the
       source device is a package datastream,  then  you  do  not
       need to specify the package option.  If the package option
       is omitted, you are prompted for  which  set(s)  or  pack-
       age(s) you want to copy from that data stream.

       This  feature works the same as in which is the underlying
       mechanism used by pkginstall to copy software.

       Each session (on both the server and client  side)  gener-
       ates  a  log  which is appended to the system-wide logfile
       /var/sadm/dist/log after completion.  The session  log  is
       also mailed to root.
