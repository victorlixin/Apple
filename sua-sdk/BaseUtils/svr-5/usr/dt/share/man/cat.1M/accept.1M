       accept  allows the queuing of print requests for the named
       destinations.  A destination can be either a printer or  a
       class  of  printers.   Run lpstat -a to find the status of
       destinations.

       reject prevents queuing of print requests  for  the  named
       destinations.   A destination can be either a printer or a
       class of printers.  Run lpstat -a to find  the  status  of
       destinations.   Assign a reason for rejection of requests.
       This reason applies to all  destinations  specified.   The
       reason  is  reported by lpstat -a.  It may contain supple-
       mentary code set characters,  as  defined  in  the  locale
       specified  in  the LC_CTYPE environment variable (see LANG
       on If it contains  blanks,  reason  must  be  enclosed  in
       quotes.   The  default  reason  is  ``unknown reason'' for
       existing destinations, and ``new destination'' for  desti-
       nations  just  added  to  the system but not yet accepting
       requests.
