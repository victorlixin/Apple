       The  link command is used to create a filename that points
       to another file.  The unlink command directly calls the 
       unlink system call. The POSIX-compatible version of unlink
       supported by Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications cannot 
       be used to remove a directory.  Instead, it is recommended
       you use rm or rmdir to remove directories.
       The only difference between ln and link and unlink is that
       the latter do exactly what they are told to do, abandoning
       all  error checking.  This is because they directly invoke
       the link and unlink system calls.
