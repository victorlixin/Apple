       The  wall command reads the named file, or, if no filename
       appears, it reads the standard input until an end-of-file.
       It  then  sends  this  message  to all currently logged-in
       users preceded by: Broadcast Message from source . . .

       The command is used to warn all  users,  typically  before
       shutting  down  the  system.  When the -g option is speci-
       fied, the command uses the /etc/group  file  to  determine
       which  logged  in  users should receive the message.  When
       the -g option is specified, the message is  sent  only  to
       members of the specified group, instead of to all users.

       The  sender must be a privileged user to override any pro-
       tections the users may have invoked [see

       wall runs setgid [see to the group ID tty, to ensure write
       permissions on other user's terminals.

       The  wall command processes supplementary code set charac-
       ters according to the locale  specified  in  the  LC_CTYPE
       environment variable [see LANG on It detects non-printable
       characters before sending them to a user's terminal.  Con-
       trol  characters appear as a ^ followed by the appropriate
       ASCII character; for example,  ``\003''  is  displayed  as
       ``^C''.
