       The pkgcat command copies a software package from a server
       to standard output.  In conjunction  with  pkgcat  can  be
       used to install a package whose contents reside on another
       system in the network.

       turns  on  verbose  output  mode  and  causes   additional
       description   of  pkgcat  events  to  be  written  to  the
       /var/sadm/dist/log log file.  Specifies  (default).  spec-
       ifies  the  software  source for the copy.  The format for
       the source location is either:

       host:[device] or [host]:device

       where: is the name or Internet address (IP)  of  the  host
       where  the  package(s)  reside (that is, the IP address of
       the Install Server).  When the host argument  is  omitted,
       the  local  host  (the  system where pkgcat is invoked) is
       assumed.  Indicates the  device  or  directory  where  the
       package(s) reside.  Alternatively, the device argument may
       be a file containing a data stream in pkgadd format.   The
       full path name of the device (for example, /dev/rmt/c0s0),
       directory, or file must be used.

       When the device argument is omitted,  the  /var/spool/dist
       directory  is  used.  provides the short name, as returned
       by the command, of the software package to distribute.  If
       the source directory is a directory containing package(s),
       then you must specify the package option.  If  the  source
       device  is  a  package datastream, then you do not need to
       specify the package option.

       This feature works the same as in which is the  underlying
       mechanism used by pkgcat.

       Each  session  (on both the server and client side) gener-
       ates a log which is appended to  the  system-wide  logfile
       /var/sadm/dist/log  after  completion.  The session log is
       also mailed to root.
