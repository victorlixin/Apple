       The  command sar provides usage information for individual
       processors, as well as  summary  information  for  average
       processor usage.

       In  the first synopsis line, sar samples cumulative activ-
       ity counters in the operating system at n intervals  of  t
       seconds,  where  t  should be 5 or greater and the default
       value of n is 1.  (Note that if the sampling  interval  is
       less  than  5,  the  activity of sar itself may affect the
       sample.)  If the -o option is  specified,  sar  saves  the
       samples  in  file  in  binary format.  The type of command
       shown in the first synopsis  line  immediately  sends  the
       output  for  every  option  specified  to standard output,
       without organizing it into a  rational  format;  data  for
       different  options  appears  in an undifferentiated jumble
       and is difficult to read.  Therefore, when running sar  in
       the format of the first synopsis line, we recommend: spec-
       ifying only one option, and avoiding the -A option  (which
       is equivalent to specifying all options)

       In  the  second  synopsis  line, with no sampling interval
       specified, sar extracts data from  a  previously  recorded
       file,  either  the  one  specified by the -f option or, by
       default, the standard  system  activity  daily  data  file
       /var/adm/sa/sadd for the current day dd.  The starting and
       ending times of the report can be bounded using the -s and
       -e  time  arguments of the form hh[:mm[:ss]] The -i option
       selects records at sec second intervals.   Otherwise,  all
       intervals found in the data file are reported.

       When  displaying data, sar fits numbers within their allo-
       cated field widths by changing  output  formats.   if  the
       number  exceeds  the output field width and it has decimal
       places, sar drops the decimal places.  if removing decimal
       places does not make the number fit, sar prints the number
       in shortened exponential notation.  For  example,  if  the
       number  is  123456578 and the field width is 6, sar prints
       1.23e7.

       Subsets of data to be printed  are  specified  by  option:
       Report system activity for the specified processors rather
       than for system wide activity.  System wide data  will  be
       reported  for those metrics that do not have per-processor
       counts.  The processor list is a  list  of  processor  IDs
       separated  by  commas,  or  ALL to request reports for all

                                                                1

       processors.  In the former case, only data for the  speci-
       fied  processors  is reported.  Specifying ALL causes data
       for every processor to be reported as well as system  wide
       data.   Note that system wide data is suppressed (for met-
       rics collected per-processor) unless  the  ALL  option  is
       used (even if the processor list includes all processors).

       When the -P option is not specified, aggregate information
       is displayed.  Report processor utilization (the default):
       portion of time running in user mode portion of time  run-
       ning in system mode portion of time idle with some process
       waiting for block I/O portion of time otherwise idle  por-
       tion  of  time  spent  in interrupt handling Report buffer
       activity: transfers per  second  of  data  between  system
       buffers  and disk or other block devices accesses per sec-
       ond of system buffers cache hit ratios, such  as  ((lread-
       bread)/lread)  as  a  percentage  transfers  per second by
       means of raw (physical) device mechanism

       If the -R option  has  been  specified,  the  %rcache  and
       %wcache  columns  are not displayed.  In addition, bwrit/s
       is displayed as bwrite  and  lwrit/s  as  lwrite.   Report
       activity  for hard disks.  In the data display, the device
       column specifies the individual slices  on  the  disk,  as
       well  as  the entire disk itself.  The slices are referred
       to as cCbBtTdDsS, and the full  disk  is  referred  to  as
       cCbBtTdD.   The  reference page contains an explanation of
       this disk and slice naming notation.

       The data reported is: the size in megabytes of the disk or
       slice.   percentage  of  time  disk  was  busy servicing a
       transfer request The average number of requests  outstand-
       ing  during  the  monitored period (the number of requests
       being serviced).  This number is the ratio of  total  time
       for  all  requests to complete to total time disk was busy
       servicing the requests minus 1.  number of data  transfers
       to  or  from  disk  per  second  number of 512-byte blocks

       average time in milliseconds for a transfer request to  be
       completed by the disk (including seek, rotational latency,
       and data transfer times)

       When the -R option has been specified, the columns  avque,
       avwait,  and  avserv  are  not  displayed.  Two additional
       columns, busy and resp are also displayed.  busy shows the
       total time in microseconds that the disk was active.  resp
       shows the elapsed time in  microseconds  times  the  queue
       length over the interval.  Report TTY device activity (per

       If -R is specified then %dnlc is replaced by dnlc-hits and
       dnlc-miss, the counts of cache hits  and  misses.   Report
       average  queue  length  while  occupied, and percentage of
       time occupied: size of processor private queue of  process

       If  the  -P  option has not been specified, then the prunq
       and %prunocc columns will be blank.  Report status of pro-
       cess,  lightweight  processes,  i-node, file, and file and

       (both in use and free).  maximum limit of inodes that  can
       be  allocated.   (This is a soft upper limit, so alloc may
       exceed limit.)  number of inode allocation  failures  that
       occur  between  sampling points.  (This can occur when the
       limit is exceeded or when memory for  inodes  is  unavail-
       able.)  the percentage of inodes taken off the freelist by
       iget that had reusable pages associated with them.   These
       pages  are  flushed  and cannot be reclaimed by processes.
       Thus, this is the percentage  of  igets  that  cause  page
       flushes.

       If  the  -R  option has been specified, the %ipf column is
       not displayed.  Instead, the columns  ipage  and  inopage,
       equal  to  the  counts of inodes with and without reusable
       pages respectively, are  displayed.   Report  message  and

       When the -R option has  been  specified,  raw  counts  for
       pgout/s  are shown as pgouts, ppgout/s as ppgouts, vfree/s
       as vfrees, pfree/s  as  pfrees,  and  vscan/s  as  vscans.

       buffers are predetermined sizes.  the number  of  requests
       that  were not satisfied (failed) Report all data (equiva-
       lent to -udqbwcayvtmpgrk).  When -P is specified, per pro-
       cessor output is produced for the appropriate options, and
       system wide information is produced for the other options.
       Report  raw  data values.  Using this option, sar displays
       the values of the counters from  which  metrics  are  com-
       puted,  rather  than  computed  values.  For example, when
       used with -u, the number  of  clock  ticks  are  displayed
       rather than a percentage.

       When  using  the -R option, % prefixes and /s suffixes are
       not displayed in column headings.  For example, instead of
       %name  or  name/s,  the heading becomes name.  Some tables
       are displayed differently; the layout of tables  reporting
       the  ratio  of  two counters is changed.  Columns that are
       computed from more than one counter are not displayed.  If
       one,  or  both, of these counters is not already output in
       another column, then a new column is added for  it.   This
       changes the tables for the options -b, -d, -a, -t.  At the
       end of the report averages are not computed; instead,  the
