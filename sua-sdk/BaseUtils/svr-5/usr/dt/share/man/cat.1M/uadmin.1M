       The  uadmin command provides control for basic administra-
       tive functions.  This command is tightly coupled  to  low-
       level system administration procedures and is not intended
       for general use.  It may be invoked only by  a  privileged
       user.

       The   arguments  cmd  (command)  and  fcn  (function),  as
       described on the manual page, are  converted  to  integers
       and passed to the uadmin system call.
