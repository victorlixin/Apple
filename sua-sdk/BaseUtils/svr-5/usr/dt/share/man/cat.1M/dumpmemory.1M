       dumpmemory  dumps all memory while the system is in system
       state 3 (multi-user state) and does not require  a  reboot
       of  the  system.   Users  can be active on the system when
       dumpmemory is executed because it doesn't  interfere  with
       other things going on in the system.

       Unlike  a  normal  system dump, which is a snapshot of the
       system taken when it  is  stopped,  memory  is  constantly
       changing in system state 3.  Thus, because of the volatil-
       ity of the kernel  structures,  some  of  the  information
       obtained  with dumpmemory may not be valid.  Nevertheless,
       dumpmemory can be very useful when  you  are  analyzing  a
       hung,  or  poorly performing application, or when you need
       to diagnose and correct poor system performance.

       dumpmemory prompts you for a filename, in  which  it  will
       save  the  memory  dump.  The file you name should be in a
       filesystem with enough space to hold  all  the  memory  on
       your system because that's what will be dumped.
