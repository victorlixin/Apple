       The  shareall  command  and the unshareall command control
       sharing of distributed filesystem resources.

       Only a privileged user may execute these commands.

   OOppttiioonnss
       When used with no arguments, shareall shares all resources
       from  file,  which contains a list of share command lines.
       If no file is specified, then the file /etc/dfs/dfstab  is
       used.

       Resources  may be shared to specific filesystems by speci-
       fying the filesystems in  a  comma-separated  list  as  an
       argument to -F.

       unshareall  unshares all currently shared resources. With-
       out a -F flag, it unshares resources for  all  distributed
       filesystem types.
