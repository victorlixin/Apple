       The  backup command provides an archiving facility that is
       adequate for most small machines and machines with a mini-
       mal amount of software installed.

       Although  many  options  cannot  be  run unless a user has
       privileges to do so, some options can be executed  by  any
       user without special privileges.

       Do  not confuse the backup and restore facilities with the
       emergency   recovery   facilities.     Typically,    after
       installing  the  system and all add-on software (for exam-
       ple,  the  Online  Data   Manager),   emergency   recovery
       diskettes and emergency recovery tape(s) are created using
       the and commands.  This media is then  stored  in  a  safe
       location  in  case  your  system  is  corrupted and a full
       recovery of the hard disk is needed.  Assuming your system
       is  not  damaged, the backup and restore facilities should
       be used regularly to perform all archiving  and  restoring
       of user data files.

       Backup  operations  may  require  operator intervention to
       perform such tasks as inserting volumes  into  devices  or
       confirming proper volume labels.

       Specifies  the  device  to be used.  If you don't use this
       option, backup checks to  see  how  many  floppy  diskette
       drives  you  have.   If you have only one, it is used.  If
       you have more than one, you will be  prompted  to  specify
       which  you  want  used.   Backs  up files specified by the
       files argument.  Filenames may contain special  characters
       (such as ``*'' and ``.''), which will be expanded later by
       the shell.  The argument (files) must be in quotes.   Pro-
       duces  a history of backups.  Tells the user when the last
       complete and incremental/partial backups were done.   Per-
       forms  a  partial  (also know as incremental) backup.  All
       files modified since the most recent complete  or  partial
       backup  are  backed up.  At least one complete backup must
       be done before a partial backup can be done.  Backs  up  a
       user's  home  directory.   All  files  in  the user's home
       directory will be backed up.  At least one  user  must  be
       specified.   If  you  specify more than one user, the list
       must be enclosed in quotes.  If you specify  -u  all,  all
       users'  home  directories  will  be backed up.  A complete
       backup.  All files changed since the system was  installed
       are backed up.

       If  a  backup  or restore is aborted or fails to complete,
       then in some cases the devices which were being  used  may
       be  left  reserved  to the original backup or restore pro-
       cess.  This may prevent subsequent backup or restore oper-
       ations  from  working.   You can check whether devices are
       reserved by executing: devreserv

       which reports any reserved devices, with the process id of
       the process to which each is attached.  To free a reserved
       device for reuse, enter: devfree pid

       where pid is the process id reported by devreserv.

                                                                2
