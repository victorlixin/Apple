       The  link command is used to create a filename that points
       to another file.  Linked  files  and  directories  can  be
       removed  by  the  unlink  command; however, it is strongly
       recommended that the rm and rmdir commands be used instead
       of the unlink command.

       The only difference between ln and link and unlink is that
       the latter do exactly what they are told to do, abandoning
       all  error checking.  This is because they directly invoke
       the link and unlink system calls.

       These commands can be run only by a privileged user.
