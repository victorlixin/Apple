       ff reads the files and directories of  the  special  file.
       I-node  data  is saved for files which match the selection
       criteria which is either the  inode  number  and/or  inode
       age.   Output  consists  of  the  path name and other file
       information.  Output fields are positional.  The output is
       produced in i-node order.  The default line produced by ff
       is: path-name i-number current_options  are  options  sup-
       ported  by the s5-specific module of ff.  Other FSTypes do
       not necessarily support these  options.   specific_options
       indicate suboptions specified in a comma-separated list of
       suboptions and/or keyword-attribute pairs for  interpreta-
       tion by the FSType-specific module of the command.

       Specify  the  FSType on which to operate.  If -F FSType is
       not specified it is determined  by  matching  the  special
       with  an  entry in /etc/vfstab.  If this fails, heuristics
       similiar to those used by are used to determine  the  file
       system  type.   If the FSType is known beforehand, use the
       -F option. This command  executes  faster  if  it  is  not
       required  to  autodetect file system types.  Echo the com-
       plete command line, but do not execute the  command.   The
       command  line  is generated by using the options and argu-
       ments provided by the user and adding to them  information
       derived  from  /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used to
       verify and validate the command line.  Specify FSType-spe-
       cific options.

       This  command  may  not  be  supported  for all filesystem
       types.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
