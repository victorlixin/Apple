       The     ttymap     command     creates     and     updates
       /var/adm/ttymap.data with information from the /dev direc-
       tory tree and the /etc/ttysrch file.

       The  ttymap command is run during system initialization to
       create     the     /var/adm/ttymap.data     file.      The
       /var/adm/ttymap.data  file  is used by the ttyname library
       function  to  search  for  terminal  and  terminal-related
       device  files.  The command populates /var/adm/ttymap.data
       with a list of device  files  indexed  by  device  ID  and
       filesystem  ID, and with a time-stamped map of directories
       within /dev.

       The library function attempts to find  devices  by  lookup
       based  on device number and filesystem ID.  If a candidate
       with matching device and filesystem ID is  found,  ttyname
       checks  its  inode  number.  If no match is found, ttyname
       checks each directory in the map to see  if  it  is  newer
       than  the time stamp in the /var/adm/ttymap.data file.  If
       a newer directory is found, ttyname searches the directory
       for device files and recursively searches any newer subdi-
       rectories.

       The /etc/ttysrch file can be used to  specify  directories
       that  should  be  ignored, which decreases the size of the
       /var/adm/ttymap.data file, providing faster lookup, and to
       specify  directories  that  contain  clone  devices, which
       allows ttyname to accept device files that do not match on
       inode number.
