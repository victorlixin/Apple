       When  specified  with  no  options,  rlockshm  attempts to
       attach to the shared memory and creates it if  it  doesn't
       exist  (using  the  configParam  settings  that follow the
       options list, if given).

       The following options to rlockshm can be entered from  the
       command  line:  This  option may be specified to force the
       creation of the shared memory and semaphores.  It  reports
       an  error  if  the indicated resources already exist.  The
       configParam setting may be used to change the default con-
       ditions.   Display  the  default  configuration  and exit.
       Note that the default values may not be the currently con-
       figured values (see the -m option).  Display the help mes-
       sage.  This option prevents any  further  processing  from
       the  program.  Display the current configuration and exit.
       Note that the current values may not be the  same  as  the
       default  values  (see the -d option).  Also, if the shared
       memory and semaphores don't exist, this option allows them
       to  be created unless other options prevent it.  Specifies
       explicit removal of a corrupted shared memory segment  and
       semaphore.   (For  certain, very stubborn cases, it may be
       necessary to use a host-provided  command  to  remove  the
       resources  individually.)   Specifies  that every entry in
       the internal table being displayed is to be  shown.   Nor-
       mally  when  the  internal  tables are displayed, only the
       entries that are currently in use are shown.  Displays the
       file  table.   The  file table contains an entry for every
       distinct open file.  Displays the hash  table.   The  hash
       table  is  used  to  speed lookup of the file table entry.
       Displays the lock table.  Each entry  in  the  lock  table
       corresponds  to  a  specific  lock request from a personal
       computer running  PC-Interface.   Displays  the  open-file
       table.   The  open-file  table  is a record of each of the
       open requests made by  a  personal  computer  running  PC-
       Interface.   The number of entries in this table should be
       no fewer than the number of entries in the file table.

       The rlockshm command takes optional parameters,  specified
       by  configParam,  in  the  form: param=value The following
       parameters can be configured: Shared memory segment attach
       address (the normal value is 0, which allows the system to
       select the address,  avoiding  most  potential  problems).
       Low 16 bits of the shared memory and semaphore keys.  Max-
       imum number of open file table entries.  Maximum number of
       file  header table entries.  Maximum number of hashed file
       table  entries.   Maximum  number  of  record  lock  table
       entries.  Maximum number of individual record locks.  dis-
       plays the internal version number for this command.

                                                                1

       All pcidossvr processes should be terminated before  using
       the  -r option.  For the greatest safety, the PC-Interface
       server should also be stopped  so  that  new  PC-Interface
       connections can't occur.

       When  setting  configuration  data,  you  must  create the
       shared memory segment and semaphore for rlockshm.  If they
       already  exist,  they  should  be  removed  (using  the -r
       option).
