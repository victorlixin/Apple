       strerr  receives  error  log messages from the STREAMS log
       driver The error log files produced reside in  the  direc-
       tory /var/adm/streams, and are named error.mm-dd, where mm
       is the month and dd is the day of the  messages  contained
       in each log file.

       The  format  of  an  error  log  message  is: <seq> <time>
       <ticks> <flags> <mid> <sid> <text> error  sequence  number
       time  of  message  in  hh:mm:ss time of message in machine
       ticks since boot priority level the message was also  sent
       to  a tracing process indicates a fatal error send mail to
       the system administrator module ID number of source sub-ID
       number of source formatted text of the error message

       Messages  that  appear  in  the  error log are intended to
       report exceptional conditions that require  the  attention
       of  the  system administrator.  Those messages which indi-
       cate the total failure  of  a  STREAMS  driver  or  module
       should  have the F flag set.  Those messages requiring the
       immediate attention of the administrator will have  the  N
       flag  set,  which causes the error logger to send the mes-
       sage to the system administrator via mail.   The  priority
       level  usually  has  no  meaning in the error log but will
       have meaning if the message is also sent to a tracer  pro-
       cess.

       Once  initiated,  strerr continues to execute until termi-
       nated  by  the  user.   It  is  commonly  executed   asyn-
       chronously.

       Only one strerr process at a time is permitted to open the
       STREAMS log driver.

       If a module or driver is  generating  a  large  number  of
       error  messages,  running  the  error  logger will cause a
       degradation in STREAMS performance.  If a large  burst  of
       messages are generated in a short time, the log driver may
       not be able to deliver some of the messages.  This  situa-
       tion is indicated by gaps in the sequence numbering of the
       messages in the log files.

                                                                1
