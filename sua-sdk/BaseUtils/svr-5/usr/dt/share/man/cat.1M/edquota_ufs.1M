       generic_options  are  options  supported  by  the  generic
       edquota command.

       edquota is a quota editor.  One or more users may be spec-
       ified on the command line.  For each user a temporary file
       is  created  with  an  ASCII representation of the current
       disk quotas for that user for each mounted ufs file system
       that  has  a quotas file, and an editor is then invoked on
       the file.  The quotas may then  be  modified,  new  quotas
       added,  and so on.  Upon leaving the editor, edquota reads
       the temporary file and modifies the binary quota files  to
       reflect the changes made.

       The  editor invoked is unless the EDITOR environment vari-
       able specifies otherwise.

       Only a privileged user may edit quotas.

       In order for quotas to be established on  a  file  system,
       the root directory of the file system must contain a file,
       owned by root, called quotas.  See for details.

       proto_user and username can be numeric,  corresponding  to
       the  uid  of  a  user.   Unassigned uids may be specified;
       unassigned names may not.  In this way, default quotas can
       be established for users who are later assigned a uid.

       Specify  the  ufs  FSType.  If  -F  ufs  is not specified,
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the  file system type.  This command executes faster if it
       is not required to autodetect file system types. If possi-
       ble,  specify  the  -F  ufs.   Duplicate the quotas of the
       proto_user specified for each username specified.  This is
       the  normal mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups
       of users.  Edit the soft time limits for each file system.
       If  the  time  limits are zero, the default time limits in
       /usr/include/sys/fs/ufs_quota.h are used.  Time  units  of
       sec(onds),   min(utes),   hour(s),  day(s),  week(s),  and
       month(s) are understood.  Time limits are printed  in  the
       greatest possible time unit such that the value is greater
       than or equal to one.
