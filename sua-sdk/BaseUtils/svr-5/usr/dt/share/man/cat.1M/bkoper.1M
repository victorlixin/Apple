       Backup  operations may require an operator to insert media
       and to confirm proper volume labels.  The  bkoper  command
       provides  a mailx-like interface for these operator inter-
       actions.  It begins by printing a list of  headers.   Each
       header describes a backup operation requiring interaction,
       the device requiring attention including  the  media  type
       and label of the volume to be inserted (see EXAMPLE).  The
       system displays prompts and the operator  issues  commands
       to resolve the backup operation.  Typing a carriage return
       invokes the current header.  If no headers have been  ser-
       viced, the current header is the first header on the list.
       If a header has been selected and  serviced,  the  current
       header is the next one following.

       bkoper  may  be  executed  only  by a privileged user.  By
       default, the operator may interact only with backup opera-
       tions that were started by the same user ID.

       If  the  -u  users option is given, the operator interacts
       only with  backup  operations  started  by  the  specified
       user(s).

       Escapes to the shell.  The remainder of the line after the
       ! is sent to the

       system shell (sh) to be interpreted as a command.   Prints
       the  current backup operation number.  Prints this summary
       of commands.  Both the p and t options operate in the same
       way.   Either  option will interact with the backup opera-
       tion described by the n'th header.  n defaults to the cur-
       rent header number.  Prints the list of backup operations.

       The exit codes for bkoper are the following: The task com-
       pleted successfully.  One or more parameters to bkoper are
       invalid.  An error has occurred  which  caused  bkoper  to
       fail to complete all portions of its task.

       A  sample  header  is shown below.  Items appearing in the
       header are listed in the following order:  header  number,
       job-ID, tag, originating device, destination group, desti-
       nation  device,  destination  volume  labels.   (See   for
       descriptions  of items.)  Not every header contains values
       for all these fields; if a destination group is not speci-
       fied  in /etc/bkup/bkreg.tab, then no value for ``destina-
       tion group'' appears in the  header.   1  back-111  usrsun

       headers  are  numbered on the basis of arrival; the oldest
       header has the lowest number.  If the  destination  device
       does  not  have a volume label, a dash is displayed in the
       header.
