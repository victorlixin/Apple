       The  hoststat  utility causes to print its persistent host
       status,  enabled  with  the  sendmail  HostStatusDirectory
       option.  Internally, sendmail maintains status information
       about network hosts. For example, it stores whether a host
       is  reachable, or is refusing connections. The HostStatus-
       Directory option tells sendmail that it should  save  this
       information  externally,  and also specifies the directory
       where that information will be stored on disk. If sendmail
       has  multiple  children processes running, this option may
       be used to ensure that the children have  access  to  this
       pool of host information.

       The  output from hoststat is a table in the following for-
       mat: hostname    how_long_ago    results  The  table  will
       contain  one  row for each host that has its status saved.
       The table columns contain the following: The name  of  the
       host  that  was connected to, which may be an MX record. A
       hostname prefixed with an asterisk indicates that the sta-
       tus file is locked and currently being updated.  Shows how
       long ago this status record was updated,  printed  in  the
       form  DD+HH:MM:SS,  where  DD is the number of days, HH is
       hours, MM is minutes and SS is seconds.  If  the  time  of
       last  update  was  less  than  one day ago, the DD+ is not
       printed.   Shows  the  results  of  the  last   connection
       attempt, failure, or success.  If no result was stored, No
       status available is printed. If a result was  stored,  the
       SMTP  reply code, and the text of the message generated by
       the other  side  are  displayed.   The  purgestat  utility
       causes  sendmail  to purge all the host-status information
       saved under the directory specified by  the  HostStatusDi-
       rectory  option. This prevents new sendmail processes from
       loading it, but does not prevent existing  processes  from
       using the status information that they already have.

       The sendmail configuration file where the HostStatusDirec-
       tory option is set is /etc/sendmail.cf.

       hoststat is a synonym for the -bh command line switch  for
       sendmail,  while  purgestat  is a synonym for the -bH com-
       mand-line switch.
