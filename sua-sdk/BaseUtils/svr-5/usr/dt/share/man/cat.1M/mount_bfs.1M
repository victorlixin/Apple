       generic_options are options supported by the generic mount
       command.

       mount attaches a bfs filesystem, referenced by special, to
       the   filesystem   hierarchy   at  the  pathname  location
       mount_point, which must already exist.  If mount_point has
       any  contents prior to the mount operation, these are hid-
       den until the filesystem is unmounted.

       The options are: Specify the bfs FSType. If -F bfs is  not
       specified heuristics similiar to those used by are used to
       determine the file system  type.   This  command  executes
       faster  if  it  is  not required to autodetect file system
       types.  If  possible,  specify  the  -F  bfs.   Mount  the
       filesystem  read-only  Specify the options specific to the
       bfs filesystem.  Multiple filesystem-specific options  may
       be  listed  in any order, but must be separated by commas.
       Available options are: Read/write or  read-only.   Default
       is  read/write.  Only a privileged user can mount filesys-
       tems.
