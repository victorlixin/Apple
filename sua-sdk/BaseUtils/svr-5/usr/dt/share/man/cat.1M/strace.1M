       strace  without  arguments  writes all STREAMS event trace
       messages from all drivers and modules to its standard out-
       put.   These  messages  are  obtained from the STREAMS log
       driver (see If arguments are  provided  they  must  be  in
       triplets  of  the  form:  mid,  sid,  level where mid is a
       STREAMS module ID number, sid  is  a  sub-ID  number,  and
       level is a tracing priority level.  Each triplet indicates
       that tracing messages are to be received  from  the  given
       module/driver,  sub-ID  (usually indicating minor device),
       and priority level equal to or less than the given  level.
       The  token  all  may be used for any member to indicate no
       restriction for that attribute.

       The format of each trace message output is:  <seq>  <time>
       <ticks>  <level> <flags> <mid> <sid> <text> trace sequence
       number time of message in  hh:mm:ss  time  of  message  in
       machine ticks since boot tracing priority level message is
       also in the error log indicates a  fatal  error  mail  was
       sent  to  the  system  administrator  module  ID number of
       source sub-ID number of source formatted text of the trace
       message

       Once initiated, strace will continue to execute until ter-
       minated by the user.

       Due to performance considerations, only one strace process
       is  permitted  to  open  the STREAMS log driver at a time.
       The log driver has a list of the triplets specified in the
       command invocation, and compares each potential trace mes-
       sage against this list to decide if it should be formatted
       and  sent  up to the strace process.  Hence, long lists of
       triplets will have a greater  impact  on  overall  STREAMS
       performance.   Running strace will have the most impact on
       the timing of the modules and drivers generating the trace
       messages  that  are  sent to the strace process.  If trace
       messages are generated faster than the strace process  can
       handle them, then some of the messages will be lost.  This
       last case can be determined by examining the sequence num-
       bers on the trace messages output.

       Output  all trace messages from the module or driver whose
       module ID is 41: strace 41 all all Output those trace mes-
       sages  from  driver/module  ID 41 with sub-IDs 0, 1, or 2:
       strace  41 0 1  41 1 1  41 2 0 Messages from sub-IDs 0 and
       1  must  have  a  tracing  level  less than or equal to 1.
       Those from sub-ID 2 must have a tracing level of 0.
