       sttydefs is an administrative command that  maintains  the
       line  settings  and  hunt  sequences  for the system's TTY
       ports by making entries in and deleting entries  from  the
       /etc/ttydefs file.

       sttydefs  with  a -a or -r option may be invoked only by a
       privileged user.  sttydefs with -l may be invoked  by  any
       user on the system.

       The  options have the following meanings: If a ttylabel is
       specified, sttydefs will display the record from /etc/tty-
       defs  whose  TTY label matches the specified ttylabel.  If
       no ttylabel is specified, sttydefs will display the entire
       contents  of /etc/ttydefs.  sttydefs will verify that each
       entry it displays is correct and that the entry's  nextla-
       bel  field references an existing ttylabel.  Adds a record
       to the ttydefs file, using ttylabel  as  its  label.   The
       following  describes  the  effect of the -b, -n, -i, or -f
       options when used in conjunction with the -a option: Spec-
       ifies  that  autobaud  should be enabled.  Autobaud allows
       the system to set the line speed of a given  TTY  port  to
       the line speed of the device connected to the port without
       the user's intervention.  Specifies the value to  be  used
       in the nextlabel field in /etc/ttydefs.  If this option is
       not specified, sttydefs will set nextlabel equal to ttyla-
       bel.   Specifies the value to be used in the initial-flags
       field in /etc/ttydefs.  initial-flags must be in a  format
       recognized  by  the stty command.  These flags are used by
       ttymon when searching for the correct baud rate.  They are
       set prior to writing the prompt.

       If  this  option  is not specified, sttydefs will set ini-
       tial-flags equal to the flag 9600.  Specifies the value to
       be  used in the final-flags field in /etc/ttydefs.  final-
       flags must be in a format recognized by the stty  command.
       final-flags  are the settings used by ttymon after receiv-
       ing a successful connection request and immediately before
       invoking  the  service on the port.  If this option is not
       specified, sttydefs will  set  final-flags  equal  to  the
       flags  9600  and  sane.  Removes any record in the ttydefs
       file that has ttylabel as its label.

       If successful, sttydefs will exit  with  a  status  of  0.

       sttydefs  -l  will  generate the requested information and
       send it to the standard output.

       The following command will list all  the  entries  in  the
       ttydefs  file  and print an error message for each invalid
       entry that is detected.  sttydefs -l

       The following shows a command  that  requests  information
       for a single label and its output: # sttydefs -l 9600

       ------------------------------------------------------------------
       9600:9600 hupcl erase ^h:9600 sane ixany tab3 hupcl  erase
       ^h::4800
       ------------------------------------------------------------------

       ttylabel:        9600  initial flags:  9600 hupcl erase ^h
       final flags:    9600 sane ixany tab3 hupcl erase ^h  auto-
       baud:       no nextlabel:      4800

       The  following  sequence  of  commands will add the labels
       1200, 2400, 4800, and 9600 and  put  them  in  a  circular
       list:  sttydefs  -a  1200  -n  2400 -i 1200 -f "1200 sane"
       sttydefs -a 2400 -n 4800 -i 2400 -f "2400  sane"  sttydefs
       -a 4800 -n 9600 -i 4800 -f "4800 sane" sttydefs -a 9600 -n
       1200 -i 9600 -f "9600 sane"
