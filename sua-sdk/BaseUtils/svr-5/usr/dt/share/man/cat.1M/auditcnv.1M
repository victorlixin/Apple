       The  auditcnv  shell  level  command creates an audit mask
       file for the user login interface.   auditcnv  is  invoked
       when the audit package is installed.

       Information  from the /etc/passwd and /etc/default/useradd
       files is used to assign an initial default audit mask  for
       every  user  on  the system.  If either the /etc/passwd or
       /etc/default/useradd file does  not  exist  or  cannot  be
       accessed,  an  error  message is displayed (see ``Diagnos-
       tics'').  The defadm command modifies  the  value  of  the
       AUDIT_MASK parameter in the /etc/default/useradd file.  If
       the AUDIT_MASK parameter does not exist or has an  invalid
       value,  an event mask of none is set and a warning message
       is displayed (see ``Diagnostics'').

       If the audit mask file, /etc/security/ia/audit  cannot  be
       created  or  already exists, an error message is displayed
       (see ``Diagnostics'').

       When the auditcnv command is invoked  and  completes  suc-
       cessfully,  the following message is displayed: /etc/secu-
       rity/ia/audit created If the  /etc/security/ia/audit  file
       is  corrupted  or accidentally removed, auditcnv should be
       invoked before any further users log  in  to  the  system.
       The  audit  mask  for  users who log in while this file is
       corrupted or nonexistent may not include the desired audit
       events.

       Upon  successful  completion,  the  auditcnv command exits
       with a value of zero (0).  If there are errors,  it  exits
       with  one  of  the  following values and prints the corre-
       sponding error message: usage: auditcnv

       Invalid command syntax.  file file does not  exist  cannot
       access  file file cannot create audit mask file audit mask
       file already exists

       The audit  mask  file  already  exists  when  auditcnv  is
       invoked.  unable to stat() file, errno="errno" The follow-
       ing warning message may be  displayed.   a  default  audit
       mask of none was set for all users
