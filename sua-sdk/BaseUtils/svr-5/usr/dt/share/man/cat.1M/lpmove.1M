       lpmove  moves  requests  that were queued by lp between LP
       destinations.  The first form of the lpmove command  shown
       above (under ``Synopsis'') moves the named requests to the
       LP destination dest.  Requests are request-IDs as returned
       by  lp.  The second form of the lpmove command attempts to
       move all requests for  destination  dest1  to  destination
       dest2; lp then rejects any new requests for dest1.

       Note  that  when  moving requests, lpmove never checks the
       acceptance status (see of the new destination.  Also,  the
       request-IDs  of  the  moved  requests  are not changed, so
       users can still find their requests.  The  lpmove  command
       does  not move requests that have options (such as content
       type and form required) that cannot be handled by the  new
       destination.

       If a request was originally queued for a class or the spe-
       cial destination any, and the first  form  of  lpmove  was
       used,  the  destination  of the request is changed to new-
       destination.  A request thus affected is printable only on
       new-destination  and  not on other members of the class or
       other acceptable printers if the original destination  was
       any.
