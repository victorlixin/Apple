       devreserv  reserves  devices  for exclusive use.  When the
       device is no longer required, use devfree to release it.

       Designates a unique  key  on  which  the  device  will  be
       reserved.   The key must be a positive integer.  Defines a
       list of devices that devreserv  will  search  to  find  an
       available device.  (The list must be formatted as a single
       argument to the shell.)

       devreserv reserves at  most  one  device  per  devicelist.
       Each  list  is  searched  in  linear order until the first
       available device is found.  If a device cannot be reserved
       from each list, the entire reservation fails.

       If  you  execute devreserv without arguments, devices that
       are currently reserved are listed, and the keys  to  which
       they  are  reserved.  When devreserv is executed with only
       the key argument, it lists the devices currently  reserved
       to that key.

       The  commands devreserv and devfree are used to manage the
       availability of devices on a system.  Their use  is  on  a
       participatory  basis and they do not place any constraints
       on actual access to the device.  They provide  a  central-
       ized bookkeeping point for those who want to use them.  To
       summarize, devices that have been reserved cannot be  used
       by processes that utilize the device reservation functions
       until the reservation has been  canceled.   However,  pro-
       cesses that do not use device reservation may use a device
       that has been reserved since such a process would not have
       checked for its reservation status.
