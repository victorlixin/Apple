       Filesystems  other  than root (/) are considered removable
       in the sense that they can be either available to users or
       unavailable.   mount  notifies  the system that special, a
       block special device or a remote resource, is available to
       users  from  the  mount_point which must already exist; it
       becomes the name of the root of the newly mounted  special
       or resource.

       mount,  when  entered  with arguments, validates all argu-
       ments except the device name and invokes  an  FSType  spe-
       cific  mount  module.  If invoked with no arguments, mount
       lists all the mounted filesystems from  the  mount  table.
       If  invoked  with  any  of  the following partial argument
       lists (for example, one of special or mount_point or  when
       both  arguments are specified but no FSType is specified),
       mount searches /etc/vfstab to fill in  the  missing  argu-
       ments: FSType, special, mount_point, specific_options.  It
       then invokes the FSType-specific mount module.

       Most FSTypes do not have a umount specific module.  If one
       exists,  it  is  executed;  otherwise,  the generic module
       unmounts the filesystem.  If the -o option  is  specified,
       the umount specific module is always executed.

       current_options  are  options supported by the s5-specific
       module of mount and umount.  Other FSTypes do  not  neces-
       sarily  support  these options.  specific_options indicate
       suboptions specified in a comma-separated list  of  subop-
       tions and/or keyword-attribute pairs for interpretation by
       the FSType-specific module of the command.

       The options are: Print the output in a new style.  The new
       output  has  the FSType and flags displayed in addition to
       the old output.  The mount_point and  special  fields  are
       reversed.   Print  the  list of mounted filesystems in the
       /etc/vfstab format.  Specify the FSType on which to  oper-
       ate.   If  -F  FSType  is  not  specified it is determined
       either from /etc/vfstab or  from  heuristics  similiar  to
       those  used  by If the FSType is known beforehand, use the
       -F option. This command  executes  faster  if  it  is  not
       required  to  autodetect file system types.  Echo the com-
       plete command line, but do not execute the  command.   The

                                                                1

       command  line  is generated by using the options and argu-
       ments provided by the user and adding to them  information
       derived  from  /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used to
       verify and validate the command line.  Specify FSType-spe-
       cific  options.   mount  can  be  used by any user to list
       mounted filesystems and resources.  Only a privileged user
       can mount or unmount filesystems.

       mount does not prevent you from mounting a filesystem on a
       directory that is not empty.

       The  old  output  format  will  be  phased out in a future
       release and all output will be in the new -v format.   The
       most  significant  changes  are  the  addition  of two new
       fields to show the FSType and flags, and the  reversal  of
       the mount_point and special name.

       mount adds an entry to the mount table /etc/mnttab; umount
       removes an entry from the table.

       mount now resolves the mount_point argument  using  before
       any processing is performed.
