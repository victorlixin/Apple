       Restricts the report to pending restore jobs that could be
       satisfied by the specified device type or  volumes.   ddev
       describes the device or volumes used to select requests to
       be restored.  ddev is of the form: [dtype][:dlabels] dtype
       is  a  device  type  (such as diskette, cartridge tape, or
       9-track tape).   If  specified,  restrict  the  report  to
       posted  requests that could be satisfied by volumes of the
       type specified.

       dlabels is a list of volume  names  corresponding  to  the
       volumename  displayed by the labelit command.  dlabels may
       be either  comma-separated  or  blank-separated  and  sur-
       rounded  by  quotes.  If specified, restrict the report to
       posted requests that could  be  satisfied  by  an  archive
       residing  on the specified volumes.  Suppresses field wrap
       and specifies  an  output  field  separator  to  be  used.
       field_separator  is  the character that will appear as the
       field separator in the output displayed.  To make sure the
       output is clear, avoid using a character (for a separator)
       that is likely to appear in a field.  For example, do  not
       use  a colon as a field separator if the display will con-
       tain dates in which a colon is used to separate hours from
       minutes.  Suppresses the header for the report.  Restricts
       the report to the jobs specified.  jobids  is  a  list  of
       restore job IDs (either comma-separated or blank-separated
       and  surrounded  by  quotes).   Restricts  the  report  to
       requests  submitted  by the specified users (either comma-
       separated or blank-separated and  surrounded  by  quotes).
       users must be listed in the passwd file.
