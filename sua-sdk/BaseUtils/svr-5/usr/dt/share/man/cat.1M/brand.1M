       Use  the  brand utility to manage product licenses on your
       system.  With it, you  can  license  products,  additional
       users  and  CPUs,  register  them,  and generate a list of
       existing licenses and related product information.

       To learn more about  licensing and registration,  and  how
       to use the graphical License Manager, see

       License  a product using the License Number, License Code,
       and License Data (if provided)  from  the  Certificate  of
       License  and  Authenticity.   Check  whether the specified
       License Number/License Code pair requires  the  specifica-
       tion  of  a  License Data string.  With this option, brand
       exits with 0 if a License Data string is required, with  8
       if the string is not required, and with any other value if
       an error occurs.  Produce a list of existing licenses  and
       product  information.   This  list includes information on
       each license's product ID, version, License Number,  anno-
       tation  field, start date, and expiration date.  This list
       also includes the product name, version,  description  and
       default License Data string for all licenses on the system
       except &UserPack; and &MPX;s.  Return the product  ID  and
       version,  separated  by  a period (``.''), associated with
       the specified License Number/License Code  pair.   If  the
       specified  License  Number/License  Code  pair is invalid,
       brand exits with 13.  Register the product  identified  by
       license_number  using  the Registration Key provided by an
       Registration Center.  Print out a usage message.
