       ncheck with no options generates a pathname  vs.  i-number
       list of all files on special.  If special is not specified
       on the command line the list is generated for all specials
       in  /etc/vfstab for entries which have a numeric fsckpass.
       special  is  a  character  special  device  on  which  the
       filesystem exists.

       current_options  are  options supported by the s5-specific
       module of ncheck.  Other FSTypes do not  necessarily  sup-
       port  these options.  specific_options indicate suboptions
       specified in a comma-separated list of  suboptions  and/or
       keyword-attribute  pairs for interpretation by the FSType-
       specific module of the command.

       The options are: Specify the FSType on which  to  operate.
       If  -F  FSType  is  not specified it will be determined by
       finding an entry in /etc/vfstab that has a  numeric  fsck-
       pass  field  and  a matching special if specified. If this
       fails, heuristics similiar to those used by  are  used  to
       determine  the  file  system type.  If the FSType is known
       beforehand, use  the  -F  option.  This  command  executes
       faster  if  it  is  not required to autodetect file system
       types.  Echo the complete command line, but do not execute
       the  command.   The command line is generated by using the
       options and arguments provided by the user and  adding  to
       them  information  derived  from /etc/vfstab.  This option
       should be used to verify and validate  the  command  line.
       used to specify FSType specific options if any.

       This command may not be supported for all FSTypes.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
