       The dslpprotocol utility is used to configure  the  remote
       print  protocol  that  a  remote print client can use when
       sending print requests to a print queue.

       In directory-enabled printing, to print to a remote  print
       queue, the client must first get the remote print protocol
       it can use. This is obtained from the print  queue  object
       in  the  directory.  This can be one or more of BSD, S5 or
       HPNP. Where more than one protocol  is  configured  for  a
       print  queue,  the   print  system uses the first value it
       reads, so a queue will normally only have a single  proto-
       col configured.

       The  print-queue-name  parameter  is  the Relative Distin-
       guished Name (RDN)  of  the  print  queue.  If  the  value
       assigned  to print-queue-name does not exist in the direc-
       tory context (see the -C option), the command fails.

       The user of this utility  must  be  directory-enabled  and
       have permissions set for write, modify, search and read on
       the directory, in the directory context in which they  are
       administrator.

       The  following  command line options are supported: Speci-
       fies the directory context for which the command is valid.
       For  example,  the  command  can  modify  the  print queue
       object, in the directory context, to  set  up  the  remote
       print  protocol  with  which the queue can be accessed. If
       this option is not given, the current directory context is
       valid.  Print out a description of the remote print proto-
       col parameters associated with the print queue.  Specifies
       the  remote  print  protocol that can be used when sending
       print requests to this print queue. The protocol type val-
       ues  supported  are bsd, s5 and hpnp. The default value is
       bsd.  Set the network connection  timeout  value  for  the
       specified protocol, that is, the time a network connection
       should stay alive in an idle condition  before  disconnec-
       tion.  The  value n can also be specified in order to dis-
       able timing out. The value 0 causes the connection  to  be
       dropped  as  soon as it becomes idle. The default value is
       10 minutes, and there is no practical upper limit. See the
       manual  page  for a full definition of the -T option.  Set
       the network connection retry time for the specified proto-
       col, that is, the time in minutes to wait before trying to
       re-establish the network connection after a  failure.  The
       default  value  is  2  minutes.  A  value  of 0 causes the

                                                                1

       connection to be retried immediately. Note that this value
       must be shorter than the timeout value specified using the
       -T option. The value n can also be specified in  order  to
       prevent  dropped connections being retried when no work is
       available. There is no practical upper limit on the value.
       For networked printers, the retry time should be set to 0.
       See the manual page  for  a  full  definition  of  the  -R
       option.   This option is used to remove a specified proto-
       col from the print queue object. This option requires that
       the  -t option also be specified.  Used with the -l option
       to display the print queue's protocol setup  in  a  simple
       format.
