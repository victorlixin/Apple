       fsdb is a filesystem debugger which allows for the  manual
       repair  of  a filesystem after a crash.  special is a spe-
       cial  device  used  to  indicate  the  filesystem  to   be
       debugged.   fsdb  is  intended for experienced users only.
       FSType is the filesystem type to be debugged.  Since  dif-
       ferent FSTypes have different structures and hence differ-
       ent  debugging  capabilities  the  manual  pages  for  the
       FSType-specific  fsdb  should  be  consulted  for  a  more
       detailed description of the debugging capabilities.

       fsdb processes supplementary code set characters according
       to  the locale specified in the LC_CTYPE environment vari-
       able [see LANG on except that the f or =" symbols  do  not
       display multibyte characters correctly.

       current_options  are  options supported by the s5-specific
       module of fsdb.  Other FSTypes do not necessarily  support
       these options.  specific_options indicate suboptions spec-
       ified in a comma-separated list of suboptions and/or  key-
       word-attribute pairs for interpretation by the FSType-spe-
       cific module of the command.

       The options are: Specify the FSType on which  to  operate.
       If  -F  FSType  is  not specified it will be determined by
       matching the special with an entry in /etc/vfstab. If this
       fails,  heuristics  similiar  to those used by are used to
       determine the file system type.  If the  FSType  is  known
       beforehand,  use  the  -F  option.  This  command executes
       faster if it is not required  to  autodetect  file  system
       types.  Echo the complete command line, but do not execute
       the command.  The command line is generated by  using  the
       options  and  arguments provided by the user and adding to
       them information derived from  /etc/vfstab.   This  option
       should  be  used  to verify and validate the command line.
       Specify FSType-specific options.

       This command may not be supported for all FSTypes.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
