DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       devfree  releases  devices  from exclusive use.  Exclusive
       use is requested with the command devreserv.

       When devfree is invoked with only  the  key  argument,  it
       releases all devices that have been reserved for that key.
       When  called  with  key  and  device  arguments,   devfree
       releases  the  specified  devices  that have been reserved
       with that key.

UUssaaggee
       The  commands devreserv and devfree are used to manage the
       availability of devices on a system.   These  commands  do
       not  place  any  constraints  on the access to the device.
       They serve only as a  centralized  bookkeeping  point  for
       those  who  wish  to  use them.  Processes that do not use
       devreserv may concurrently use a  device  with  a  process
       that has reserved that device.

RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       devfree  returns  one  of the following values: Successful
       completion of the task.  Command syntax incorrect, invalid
       option  used, or internal error occurred.  Device table or
       device reservation table could not be opened for  reading.
       Reservation  release  could  not  be  completely fulfilled
       because one or more of the devices was not reserved or was
       not reserved on the specified key.
