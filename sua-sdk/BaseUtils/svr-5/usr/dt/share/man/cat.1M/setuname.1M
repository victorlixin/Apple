       Use the setuname command to change the values for the sys-
       name and hostname  parameters  (see  for  descriptions  of
       these  parameters).   One or both of the -s and -n options
       must be specified.

       The options and arguments for this  command  are:  sysname
       specifies the new value for the sysname parameter, and can
       contain alphanumeric characters and the special characters
       dash (-), underbar (_), and dollar sign ($).

       It  is  normally  not  advisable to change the sysname, as
       applications may depend on the default value of  UnixWare.
       See for notes on using the SCOMPAT variable to change sys-
       name for applications that require a specific value  other
       than  the default.  Also see for more on uname return val-
       ues.  hostname specifies the new network host  name  (also
       known as the node name) and can contain alphanumeric char-
       acters and the special characters dash (-), underbar  (_),
       and  dollar  sign ($).  The host name is the name by which
       this system is known to other  computers  in  a  networked
       environment.    This   option   changes  the  contents  of
       /etc/nodename.

       Be aware that if you change the network host  name,  other
       software  may  break unexpectedly; so, it is good practice
       not to change a host name once it is  set.   For  example,
       networking  software and application packages may save the
       node name of your  system  at  the  time  the  package  is
       installed.

       Specifically,  setuname  does  not change the host name in
       the /etc/inet/hosts file that is used by the TCP/IP  soft-
       ware.   Therefore, each time you change the host name, you
       need to locate all the files where it has been  saved  and
       change the value.

       You  will  also have to notify the administrators of other
       machines on the network of the host name  change.   Tempo-
       rary  change.   No attempt will be made to create a perma-
       nent change.  If -n is also specified, the file /etc/node-
       name is left unchanged.

       The system architecture may place requirements on the size
       of the system name and network  host  name.   The  command
       will issue a fatal warning message and an error message if
       the name entered is incompatible with the system  require-
       ments.

       setuname attempts to change the parameter  values  in  the
       running  kernel  and in files used during a system reboot.
       A temporary change (-t) changes only the running kernel.
