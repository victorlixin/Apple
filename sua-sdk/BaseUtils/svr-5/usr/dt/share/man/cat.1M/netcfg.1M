       netcfg  configures  and  enables network products.  netcfg
       provides a standard way  to  combine  networking  products
       together  to form a networking system from compatible net-
       working  components.   Entered  without  options,   netcfg
       invokes  the a graphical management interface; this is the
       recommended method for  managing  network  adapters.   You
       must  have root or system owner privileges to run the Net-
       work Configuration Manager.  For more information, see

       netcfg assembles compatible sets  of  networking  products
       into functional groups called chains. Configuring (adding)
       a chain will do everything necessary to enable  the  func-
       tions of the component products in the chain within a sin-
       gle command.  Deconfiguring  (removing)  a  chain  through
       netcfg  does  everything necessary to disable the function
       of the component parts of the chain also in a single  com-
       mand.

       A  chain  consists of a top level product, and one or more
       lower layer networking products that  together  produce  a
       functional  networking system.  netcfg takes the following
       options: Remove. netcfg skips the main  menu  and  removes
       the  specified  chain.  Unless the -d option is specified,
       users will still be required to answer any questions  that
       are  asked by the removal scripts.  Chain names are speci-
       fied with a single word comprised of  the  names  of  each
       element   in   the   chain   separated  by  #  characters:
       top#middle...#bottom.  A single complete, valid chain name
       must  be  passed  to  netcfg with the -r option.  Version.
       netcfg prints  its  version  number  and  exits.   Status.
       netcfg prints a list of the currently installed chains and
       exits.  This is intended for use in shell scripts that are
       trying to remove all chains associated with their product.
       Add. Add a chain specified by the user. Designed  as  part
       of  the  command  line engine, this option will perform an
       add (call the add scripts) without any user  intervention.
       If the chain passed in is invalid, then netcfg will return
       an error and output a single line error  message  suitable
       for  display  to  the  user.   Reconfigure an element in a
       chain. Requires a chain name  and  element  as  arguments.
       Element.  Output  the  list of elements in the given chain
       that support reconfiguring.
