       pushfilter  loads or unloads a filter definition on an MDI
       network driver interface.

       pushfilter understands the following options: Display  the
       byte  codes  of  the filters that are applied to an inter-
       face.  Specify a filter to  be  applied  to  the  incoming
       stream of an interface.  Specify a filter to be applied to
       the outgoing stream of an interface.  Specify  the  inter-
       face  on  which  a  filter will be loaded or from which it
       will be unloaded.  Specify the protocol to which a  filter
       will  be  applied.  At present, only the Internet Protocol
       version 4, IP, is supported.  Unload the  incoming  filter
       (in), outgoing filter (out), or both incoming and outgoing
       filters (both) from an interface.
