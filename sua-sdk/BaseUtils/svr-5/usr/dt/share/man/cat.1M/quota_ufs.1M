       generic_options  are  options  supported  by  the  generic
       quota command.

       quota displays users' disk usage and limits.  Only a priv-
       ileged user may use the optional username argument to view
       the limits of other users.

       quota without options displays only warnings about mounted
       filesystems where quotas are turned on and usage  is  over
       quota.   Remotely  mounted  filesystems  which do not have
       quotas turned on are ignored.

       username can be numeric, corresponding to  the  UID  of  a
       user.

       The  -v  option  displays  user's  quotas  on  all mounted
       filesystems where quotas are turned on.
