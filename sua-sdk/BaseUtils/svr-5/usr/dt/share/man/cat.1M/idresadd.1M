       The  idresadd  command reads the System file for the named
       driver in /etc/conf/sdevice.d.  That is, it reads the file
       specified  by module_name, and attempts to create an entry
       in the Resource Manager database for every active entry in
       the  System  file.   (Active entries are those with a Y in
       the configured field.)

       The idresadd command first attempts to match the  hardware
       device  being added with an existing entry in the Resource
       Manager.  To match, the Resource Manager entry  must  have
       no  MODNAME set, or a MODNAME that matches the name of the
       driver being added.  Also, the driver must have  at  least
       one  of  its  hardware  parameters  (one  of IRQ, DMACHAN,
       IOADDR, or MEMADDR) set, and the parameter(s)  must  match
       in the Resource Manager entry and the System file entry.

       If  no  matching entry is found in the Resource Manager, a
       new entry is added to the file.  No entry is added to  the
       Resource  Manager if any entry already exists for a driver
       unless the -f option is present to force the  addition  of
       the entry.

       New  entries  in  the Resource Manager database are tagged
       with CM_ENTRY_DEFAULT, unless -n is  given.   When  -n  is
       given,  other  entries that match the driver's MODNAME and
       are tagged with CM_ENTRY_DEFAULT are removed.

   OOppttiioonnss
       Delete entries from resmgr instead of adding  them.   This
       does  not  affect the resmgr database for a loaded driver.
       Force the addition of an entry for a driver already in the
       Resource  Manager.   Mark  new  entries as pseudo-devices.
       Specify an alternate to the /etc/conf directory.
