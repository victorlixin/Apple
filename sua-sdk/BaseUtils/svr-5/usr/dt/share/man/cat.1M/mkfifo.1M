       mkfifo  creates  the FIFO special files named by its argu-
       ment list.  The arguments are taken sequentially,  in  the
       order specified; and each FIFO special file is either cre-
       ated completely or, in the case of an error or signal, not
       created at all.

       For  each  file argument, the mkfifo command behaves as if
       the function mkfifo (see was called with the argument file
       set  to  file and the mode set to the bitwise inclusive OR
       of S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH and S_IWOTH
       (unless the -m option is specified).

       If  errors  are encountered in creating one of the special
       files, mkfifo writes a diagnostic message to the  standard
       error  and continues with the remaining arguments, if any.

       mkfifo  returns  exit  code of 0 if all FIFO special files
       were created normally; otherwise it  prints  a  diagnostic
       and returns a value greater than 0.
