       evgainit is used to initialize the keyboard/display driver
       (see if extended VGA graphics modes are being used on cer-
       tain video cards.

       The  keyboard/display driver provides the interface to the
       video card.  evgainit informs the keyboard/display  driver
       which  video  card  is  installed and should be rerun each
       time the system is booted.

       In many cases the keyboard/display  driver  can  determine
       which  card  is being used and therefore this command need
       not be run.  For example, you don't need to  run  evgainit
       for  the  following  cards:  Any  card  that  doesn't have
       extended VGA capability (that is,  800x600  pixels).   Any
       card  that  is  only  VGA (640x480 pixels) or EGA (640x350
       pixels).  Any extended VGA cards (listed below) that  will
       not be set to graphics modes with resolutions greater than
       640x480 pixels.

       evgainit must be run, however,  for  the  following  cards
       before  attempting to use resolutions greater than 640x480
       pixels.  The following list shows the  card-type  argument
       value that should be used for each video card:
