       The  config_views script searches the entire documentation
       tree for all view stanza files (files with the .view  suf-
       fix),  and  uses  this data to create a set of HTML files.
       These HTML files form view pages, a hierarchy  that  helps
       the user locate documentation within the system.  The view
       stanza files fully define the paths and contents of  these
       HTML files.

       If  the  -L  option is specified, the processes are run on
       the given language (LANG); otherwise all language versions
       are  processed.  If LANG is not English, the processes are
       also run on the topicID directories in the en_US.ISO8859-1
       hierarchy.   For  example, the following command runs con-
       fig_views on all the  topicID  directories  under  the  es
       (Spanish  language) and en_US.ISO8859-1 (English language)
       directories: config_views -L es The documentation  package
       installation or removal script should run the config_views
       script after running or whenever new  documentation  pack-
       ages  are  installed  or  removed.  Each time config_views
       runs, it reconstructs all the .html  files.   If  a  .view
       file  is  removed,  then  its records are removed from the
       .html files and they are no longer  available  from  &sco-
       help;.   A  documentation package removal script can check
       for and remove any .html files created by any .view  files
       in the package.

       The   configuration   works   from  whatever  material  is
       installed when the script is run.  As such, it  works  for
       new  installation,  updates,  and removals.  The processes
       are repeatable, so processing material  that  has  already
       been  processed does not result in error.  The scripts can
       be run again on the same installed  material  and  produce
       the same results.
