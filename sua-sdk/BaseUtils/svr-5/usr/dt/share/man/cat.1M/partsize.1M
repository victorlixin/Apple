       The  function  of  partsize  is  to  print the size of the
       active  System partition for the  raw-device  disk  drive.
       The size value returned is in megabytes (MB = 2E20 bytes).
       This command is intended for  use  with  the  installation
       scripts,  but is available for general use.  If the system
       cannot retrieve a valid partition table, there will  be  a
       non-zero exit value.  If a valid partition table is found,
       but no active  system partition is found, it will  display
       a  value of zero.  the required raw-device argument is the
       character  special  device  for  the  disk  drive  to   be
       accessed.   It  should  be the slice 0 device to represent
       the  entire  device   (for   example,   /dev/rdsk/0s0   or
       /dev/rdsk/c0b0t0d0s0).

       partsize  takes  the  following options: Displays the disk
       geometry and the configuration layout of the four optional
       disk  partitions.   Disk  partitions are initialized using
       the command.  Unused partition entries contain  the  value
       100 in the OS field.  Displays the size of the entire disk
       in megabytes.  The value can be greater than the  size  of
       the    System   partition   if  multiple  partitions  were
       allocated.
