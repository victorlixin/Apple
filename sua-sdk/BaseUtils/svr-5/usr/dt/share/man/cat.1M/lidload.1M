       The  lidload  command updates the NFS internal representa-
       tion of the lid_and_priv database from the current  infor-
       mation in the corresponding file /etc/dfs/lid_and_priv and
       copies that information to the kernel.

UUssaaggee
       lidload should be run every time lid_and_priv  is  edited.
       Changes  to  the database do not take effect until lidload
       has been run.

       On running the lidload command,  changes  to  lid_and_priv
       immediately  affect  all  mounted and unmounted resources.
       Mounted resources do not need to be unmounted in order for
       lidload to take effect.

       NFS  open  files  are  affected  immediately by changes to
       lid_and_priv once lidload is executed.

       Only a privileged user can execute this command.
