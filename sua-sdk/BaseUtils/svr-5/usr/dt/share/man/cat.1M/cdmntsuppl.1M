       cdmntsuppl sets CD-ROM default features, such as ownership
       of files and directories, file permissions, user and group
       IDs, file name  conversion,  and  execute  permission  for
       directories.   You cannot use the -c option with either -l
       or -m.  Nor can you use -x with -s.

       Use cdmntsuppl without options to display the current set-
       tings.

       You  need  read  permission on the mount point to read the
       current settings.  You must have  appropriate  permissions
       to  change  administrative  CD-ROM  features.   Change the
       default features after the CD-ROM has  been  mounted,  but
       before  any CD-ROM access occurs or that change may not be
       consistently visible.

       Use file names as they are recorded on the  CD-ROM.   This
       option cannot be used with the -m or -l options.  Sets the
       default permissions for directories the same way  as  with
       the  -F  option.   Sets  the default permission for files.
       Specify mode either as symbolic or absolute.

       An absolute mode is a bit-wise inclusive  OR  of  zero  or
       more  of  the following octal values: Read by owner.  Exe-
       cute by owner.  Read by group.  Execute by group.  Read by
       others.  Execute by others.

       A symbolic mode has the form: [who] op [permission] who is
       a combination of the letters; u (user), g (group),  and  o
       (other).  a stands for ugo.

       op  is one of these symbols: adds permission to the file's
       mode removes permission assigns permission absolutely (all
       other bits are reset).  permission is a combination of the
       letters r (read), and x (execute).  Omitting permission is
       only  useful when used with = to take away all permission.
       Sets the default group of  files  and  directories,  where
       group  is  a  group ID or a valid group name.  Specifies a
       file that maps default  group  IDs  on  CD-ROM  files  and
       directories to group IDs or group names on the file system
       on which the CD-ROM is mounted.  The files and directories
       on  the  CD-ROM  must  have  an  unrestricted  final  XAR.
       Entries in gmfile must have the following syntax:

       value of group ID on CD-ROM, a colon (:), value  of  group
       ID or group name.

       Multiple entries must be separated by a newline character.

                                                                1

       The sys/cdrom.h header file defines the maximum number  of
       mappings allowed in gmfile (CD_MAXGMAP).  Sets the default
       ownership of files and directories, where owner is a  user
       ID  or  a  valid  login  name.  Specifies a file that maps
       default user IDs on CD-ROM files and directories  to  user
       IDs  or  user names on the file system on which the CD-ROM
       is mounted.  The files and directories on the CD-ROM  must
       have  an  unrestricted  final XAR.  Entries in umfile must
       have the following syntax:

       value of user ID on CD-ROM, a colon (:), value of user  ID
       or user name.

       Multiple entries must be separated by a newline character.
       The sys/cdrom.h header file defines the maximum number  of
       mappings  allowed  in  umfile (CD_MAXUMAP).  Convert upper
       case characters in File or Directory Identifiers to  lower
       case.  If the File Identifier does not contain a File Name
       Extension, do not display the period  separator.   (.)  is
       not  represented.   This  option  can  be used with the -m
       option.  Do not display the Version Number  and  semicolon
       separator  (;) of File or Directory Identifiers on CD-ROM.
       This option can be used with the -l option.  Grants search
       permission  for directories on which the searcher has read
       or  execute  permission.   Grants  search  permission  for
       directories  on which the searcher has execute permission.
