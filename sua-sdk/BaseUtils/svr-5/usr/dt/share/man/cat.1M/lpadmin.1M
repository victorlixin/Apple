       lpadmin configures the LP print service by defining print-
       ers and devices.  It is used to add and  change  printers,
       to  remove printers from the service, to set or change the
       system default destination, to define alerts  for  printer
       faults,  to mount print wheels, and, when the Network Sup-
       port Utilities is installed, to define printers for remote
       printing  services.   (For details about network printers,
       see

       The -p printer option is used to configure a  new  printer
       or  to  change  the  configuration of an existing printer.
       When you use this form of the lpadmin  command,  you  must
       select  one  of  the  following  three options: -v device,
       required  to  configure  a  local  printer;   -s   server-
       name[!server-printer-name], required to configure a remote
       printer; or -U dial-info, required to configure a  dial-up
       printer.   These, and the remaining options, may appear in
       any order.  The -A option is used to define  an  alert  to
       inform the administrator when a printer fault is detected,
       and periodically thereafter, until the  printer  fault  is
       cleared  by the administrator.  If an alert is not defined
       for a particular printer, mail will be sent to user lp  by
       default.  If the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed
       and running on the system, no one will be able to  log  in
       as  lp;  therefore,  mail must be redirected to the person
       responsible for LP administration.  The  alert-types  are:
       Send the alert message via mail (see to the administrator.
       If the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed and  run-
       ning  on the system, the alert message will be sent to the
       specified user-name (see shell-command below) at  SYS_PRI-
       VATE.   Write  the  message  to  the terminal on which the
       administrator is  logged  in.   If  the  administrator  is
       logged in on several terminals, one is chosen arbitrarily.
       If the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed and  run-
       ning  on  your  system,  write will not be available as an
       alert-type.  Do not send messages for the  current  condi-
       tion.  An administrator can use this option to temporarily
       stop receiving further messages  about  a  known  problem.
       Once the fault has been cleared and printing resumes, mes-
       sages will again be sent when another  fault  occurs  with
       the  printer.   Do  not  send messages; any existing alert
       definition for the printer will be removed.  No alert will

                                                                1

lpadmin(1M)                                           lpadmin(1M)

       be  sent  when the printer faults until a different alert-
       type (except quiet) is used.  Run the  shell-command  each
       time the alert needs to be sent.  The shell command should
       expect the message in standard input.  If there are blanks
       embedded  in  the  command, enclose the command in quotes.
       Note that the mail and write values for  this  option  are
       equivalent  to the values mail login-ID and write login-ID
       respectively, where login-ID is the current name  for  the
       administrator.   This  will  be the login ID of the person
       submitting this command unless he or she has used  the  su
       command  to change to another login ID.  If the su command
       has been used to change the login ID,  then  the  login-ID
       for  the new login is used.  Display the type of the alert
       for the printer fault.  No change is made  to  the  alert.
       The  message  sent appears as follows: The printer printer
       has stopped printing for the reason given below.  Fix  the
       problem  and bring the printer back on line.  Printing has
       stopped, but will be restarted in a few minutes; issue  an
       enable  command  if  you  want  to restart sooner.  Unless
       someone issues a change request

            lp -i request-id -P . . .

       to change the page list to print, the current request will
       be reprinted from the beginning.

       The   reason(s)  it  stopped  (multiple  reasons  indicate
       reprinted attempts):

            reason The LP print service can detect printer faults
       only  through  an  adequate  fast filter and only when the
       standard interface program or a suitable customized inter-
       face  program is used.  Furthermore, the level of recovery
       after a fault depends on the capabilities of the filter.

       If the printer is all, the alerting defined in  this  com-
       mand applies to all existing printers.

       If the -W option is not used to arrange fault alerting for
       printer, the default procedure is to mail one  message  to
       the  administrator  of printer per fault.  This is equiva-
       lent to specifying -W once or -W 0.  If minutes is a  num-
       ber  greater than zero, an alert will be sent at intervals
       specified by minutes.  Insert printer into  the  specified
       class.   Class  will  be  created  if  it does not already
       exist.  Save this comment for display whenever a user asks
       for  a  full description of printer (see The LP print ser-
       vice does not interpret this comment.  Copy the  interface
       program  of  an existing printer1 to be the interface pro-
       gram for printer.  (Options -i and -m may not be specified
       with  this option.)  This option specifies the recovery to
       be used for any print request that is stopped because of a
       printer  fault,  according to the value of fault-recovery:
       Continue printing on the top of the  page  where  printing

                                                                2

lpadmin(1M)                                           lpadmin(1M)

       stopped.   This requires a filter to wait for the fault to
       clear before automatically continuing.  Start printing the
       request  again  from  the  beginning.  Disable printing on
       printer and wait for the administrator or a user to enable
       printing again.

       During  the wait the administrator or the user who submit-
       ted the stopped print request can issue a  change  request
       that  specifies where printing should resume.  (See the -i
       option of the lp command.)  If no change request  is  made
       before  printing  is  enabled, printing will resume at the
       top of the page where stopped, if the filter allows;  oth-
       erwise, the request will be printed from the beginning.

       The default value of fault-recovery is beginning.

       Allow  or  deny  the  forms  in form-list to be printed on
       printer.  By  default  no  forms  are  allowed  on  a  new
       printer.

       For  each printer, the LP print service keeps two lists of
       forms: an ``allow-list'' of forms that may  be  used  with
       the  printer, and a ``deny-list'' of forms that may not be
       used with the printer.  With  the  -f  allow  option,  the
       forms  listed are added to the allow-list and removed from
       the deny-list.  With the -f deny option, the forms  listed
       are  added  to  the  deny-list and removed from the allow-
       list.

       If the allow-list is not empty, only the forms in the list
       may  be used on the printer, regardless of the contents of
       the deny-list.  If the allow-list is empty, but the  deny-
       list  is  not,  the forms in the deny-list may not be used
       with the printer.   All  forms  can  be  excluded  from  a
       printer  by specifying -f deny:all.  All forms can be used
       on a printer (provided the  printer  can  handle  all  the
       characteristics  of each form) by specifying -f allow:all.

       The LP print service uses this information  as  a  set  of
       guidelines  for  determining  where a form can be mounted.
       Administrators, however, are not restricted from  mounting
       a form on any printer.  If mounting a form on a particular
       printer is in disagreement with  the  information  in  the
       allow-list  or  deny-list, the administrator is warned but
       the mount is accepted.  Nonetheless, if a user attempts to
       issue  a  print  or  change request for a form and printer
       combination that is in disagreement with the  information,
       the  request  is  accepted  only  if the form is currently
       mounted on the printer.  If the form  is  later  unmounted
       before  the request can print, the request is canceled and
       the user is notified by mail.

       If the administrator tries to specify a form as acceptable
       for  use  on  a printer that doesn't have the capabilities

                                                                3

       needed by the form, the command is rejected.

       The lpadmin command will issue a warning when  an  invalid
       (nonexistent)  form  name  is  submitted with the -f deny:
       option.

       Note the other use of  -f,  with  the  -M  option,  below.
       Indicate  that  the  device associated with the printer is
       hardwired.  If neither of the mutually exclusive  options,
       -h  and  -l,  is specified, this option is assumed.  Allow
       printer to handle print requests with  the  content  types
       listed in a content-type-list.  If the list includes names
       of more than one type, the names must be separated by com-
       mas  or  blank  spaces.   (If  they are separated by blank
       spaces,  the  entire  list  must  be  enclosed  in  double
       quotes.)

       The  type simple is recognized as the default content type
       for files in the

       system.  A simple type of file is a data stream containing
       only  printable ASCII characters and the following control
       characters.
       ---------------------------------------------------------------
       Control Character Octal ValueMeaning
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

       form feed         14         move to beginning of next page
       carriage return   15         move to beginning of current line
       To  prevent  the  print  service from considering simple a
       valid type for the printer,  specify  either  an  explicit
       value (such as the printer type) in the content-type-list,
       or an empty list.  If you do want  simple  included  along
       with  other types, you must include simple in the content-
       type-list.

       Except for simple, each content-type name is freely deter-
       mined by the administrator.  If the printer type is speci-
       fied by the -T option, then the printer type is implicitly
       considered  to  be also a valid content type.  Establish a
       new interface program for printer.  interface is the path-
       name  of  the new program.  (The -e and -m options may not
       be specified with this option.)  Indicate that the  device
       associated  with  printer  is  a  login  terminal.  The LP
       scheduler (lpsched) disables all login terminals automati-
       cally  each time it is started.  (The -h option may not be
       specified with this option.)  Mount the form form-name  on
       printer.   Print  requests  that need the pre-printed form
       form-name will be printed on printer.  If  more  than  one
       printer  has  the  form mounted and the user has specified
       any (with the -d option of the lp command) as the  printer

                                                                4

       destination, then the print request will be printed on the
       one printer  that  also  meets  the  other  needs  of  the
       request.

       The  page length and width, and character and line pitches
       needed by the form are compared with those allowed for the
       printer,  by  checking  the  capabilities  in the terminfo
       database for the type of printer.  If  the  form  requires
       attributes  that  are  not available with the printer, the
       administrator is warned but the mount is accepted.  If the
       form lists a print wheel as mandatory, but the print wheel
       mounted on the printer is different, the administrator  is
       also warned but the mount is accepted.

       If  the  -a  option  is  given,  an  alignment  pattern is
       printed, preceded by the same initialization of the physi-
       cal  printer that precedes a normal print request.  Print-
       ing is assumed to start at the top of the  first  page  of
       the form.  After the pattern is printed, the administrator
       can adjust the mounted  form  in  the  printer  and  press
       return  for  another  alignment pattern (no initialization
       this time), and can continue printing  as  many  alignment
       patterns  as  desired.   The  administrator  can  quit the
       printing of alignment patterns by typing q.

       If the  -o  filebreak  option  is  given,  a  formfeed  is
       inserted  between  each copy of the alignment pattern.  By
       default, the alignment pattern  is  assumed  to  correctly
       fill a form, so no formfeed is added.

       A  form  is ``unmounted'' either by mounting a new form in
       its place or by using the -f none option.  By  default,  a
       new printer has no form mounted.

       Note  the  other  use  of  -f without the -M option above.
       Mount the print-wheel on  printer.   Print  requests  that
       need  the print-wheel will be printed on printer.  If more
       than one printer has print-wheel mounted and the user  has
       specified  any  (with  the -d option of the lp command) as
       the printer destination, then the print  request  will  be
       printed on the one printer that also meets the other needs
       of the request.

       If the print-wheel is not listed  as  acceptable  for  the
       printer,  the  administrator  is  warned  but the mount is
       accepted.  If the printer does not take print wheels,  the
       command is rejected.

       A  print  wheel  is ``unmounted'' either by mounting a new
       print wheel in its place or by using the option  -S  none.
       By default, a new printer has no print wheel mounted.

       Note the other uses of the -S option without the -M option
       described below.  Select model interface program, provided

                                                                5

       with  the  LP print service, for the printer.  (Options -e
       and -i may not be specified with this option.)   The  fol-
       lowing  interface  programs are available: generic printer
       interface interface with special security markings for the
       B2  security environment interface for PostScript printers
       only

       By default, the standard interface is used.  The  -O  con-
       trols  whether  or  not  lp will make a copy of the user's
       file(s) when a print job is  submitted.   The  copy-option
       can  be  either  copy or nocopy.  If -O copy is specified,
       the LP system will always copy the user's source files  to
       the  spool  area  when  a  print  job  is  submitted.   If
       -O nocopy is specified, the files are copied only  if  the
       user  specifies  the  -c  option of lp when submitting the
       job.

       This option sets the value of the copy-files parameter  in
       the  /etc/default/lp file.  The value, which can be either
       on or off, is checked every time a print job is submitted.
       Each  -o  option in the list below is the default given to
       an interface program if the option is  not  taken  from  a
       preprinted  form description or is not explicitly given by
       the user submitting a request (see  The  only  -o  options
       that   can   have   defaults  defined  are  listed  below.

       cpi=scaled-decimal-number        lpi=scaled-decimal-number
       stty='stty-option-list' scaled-decimal-number refers to  a
       non-negative  number used to indicate a unit of size.  The
       type of unit is shown by a trailing letter attached to the
       number.  Three types of scaled decimal numbers can be used
       with the LP print service: numbers that show sizes in cen-
       timeters  (marked  with  a  trailing c); numbers that show
       sizes in inches (marked with a trailing  i);  and  numbers
       that  show  sizes  in  units appropriate to use (without a
       trailing letter), that is, lines,  characters,  lines  per
       inch, or characters per inch.

       The  first  four default option values must agree with the
       capabilities of the type of physical printer,  as  defined
       in the terminfo database for the printer type.  If they do
       not, the command is rejected.

       The stty-option-list is not checked  for  allowed  values,
       but is passed directly to the stty program by the standard
       interface program.  Any error messages  produced  by  stty
       when  a  request  is  processed (by the standard interface
       program) are mailed to the user submitting the request.

       You can set any of the -o options to  the  default  values
       (which  vary  for  different types of printers), by typing
       them without assigned values, as follows:  length=  width=
       cpi=  lpi=  stty=  Allow  a user to submit a print request
       specifying  that  no  banner  page  be  printed.   If  the
       Enhanced  Security  Utilities are installed and running on
       your system, this option will be silently ignored.   Force
       a banner page to be printed with every print request, even
       when a user asks for no banner page.  This is the default;
       you must specify -o nobanner if you want to allow users to
       be able to specify -o nobanner with the lp  command.   The
       -R  option allows you to define the range of device levels
       used for the initial screening of requests  to  a  network
       printer.   You  define such a range by specifying its high
       and low ends (with the arguments high and low) on a  local
       system.   (lpadmin  stores  the range of device levels you
       specify in a file called /etc/lp/printers/printer/configu-
       ration, where printer is the name of the relevant device.)
       The default values of high and low are  SYS_RANGE_MAX  and
       SYS_RANGE_MIN, respectively (the same values assigned to a
       local printer).

       This option is available only if the Network Support Util-
       ities  is  installed  on the system.  This option is valid
       only if you use the -s system option or the -R option  for
       an  existing  network  printer.  (If you don't specify the
       value of low after the -R option, it is assigned the  same
       value as high by default.)  Remove printer from the speci-
       fied class.  If printer is the last member of class,  then
       class  will  be removed.  Allow either the print wheels or
       aliases for character sets named in list to be used on the
       printer.   The  -S  option  doesn't let you add items to a
       list specified with an earlier invocation of -S;  instead,
       it  replaces  an  existing  list with a new one.  (Thus -S
       differs from the -f, -u, allow, and  deny  options,  which
       allow  you to modify existing lists of available forms and
       authorized users.)  Once you've run  the  -S  option,  the
       print wheels and character sets specified (in list) on the
       current command line will be the only ones available.

       If the printer is a type that  takes  print  wheels,  then
       list  is  a  comma  or space separated list of print wheel
       names.  (Enclose the  list  with  quotes  if  it  contains
       blanks.)   These  will be the only print wheels considered
       mountable on the printer.  (You can always force a differ-
       ent print wheel to be mounted, however.)  Until the option
       is used to specify a list, no print wheels will be consid-
       ered mountable on the printer, and print requests that ask
       for a particular print wheel with  this  printer  will  be
       rejected.

       If  the  printer  is  a type that has selectable character
       sets, then list is a comma  or  blank  separated  list  of

                                                                7

lpadmin(1M)                                           lpadmin(1M)

       character  set name ``mappings'' or aliases.  (Enclose the
       list with quotes if it contains blanks.)  Each ``mapping''
       is  of the form known-name=alias The known-name is a char-
       acter set number preceded by cs (such as cs3 for character
       set  three)  or  a  character  set  name from the Terminfo
       database entry csnm.  (See If this option is not  used  to
       specify a list, only the names already known from the Ter-
       minfo database or numbers with a  prefix  of  cs  will  be
       acceptable for the printer.

       If  list  is the word none, any existing print wheel lists
       or character set aliases will be removed.

       Note the other uses of the -S with the -M option described
       above.  This option is required when you are configuring a
       remote printer.  It makes a server printer  accessible  to
       users on your system.  server-name is the name of the sys-
       tem on which the printer is located.  It must be listed in
       the  LP  systems  table.   (See server-printer-name is the
       name used on the server  system  for  that  printer.   For
       example, if you want to access printer1 on server1 and you
       want it called printer2 on your system, enter -p  printer2
       -s server1!printer1.

       If the -R option is not also specified, the default values
       of SYS_RANGE_MAX and SYS_RANGE_MIN  are  assigned  to  the
       high  and  low parameters, respectively.  These parameters
       define the range of device levels for  a  server  printer.
       If  you  use  this  option  (either to define a new server
       printer or to redefine  a  formerly  local  printer  as  a
       server printer) without also using the -R option, then, by
       default, high will be set to SYS_RANGE_MAX, and  low  will
       be set to SYS_RANGE_MIN.

       This option is available only if the Network Support Util-
       ities is installed on your system.  Identify  the  printer
       as  being of one or more printer-types.  Each printer-type
       is used to extract data from the terminfo  database;  this
       information  is  used  to  initialize  the  printer before
       printing each user's request.  Some filters may also use a
       printer-type  to convert content for the printer.  If this
       option is not  used,  the  default  printer-type  will  be
       unknown; no information will be extracted from terminfo so
       each user request will be printed without first initializ-
       ing  the  printer.   Also, this option must be used if the
       following are to work: -o cpi, -o lpi, -o  width,  and  -o
       length  options of the lpadmin and lp commands, and the -S
       and -f options of the lpadmin command.

       If the printer-type-list contains more than one type, then
       the  content-type-list  of  the  -I  option must either be
       specified as simple, as empty (-I ""), or not specified at
       all.   Allow  or deny the users in login-ID-list access to
       the printer.  By default all users on the local system are

                                                                8

lpadmin(1M)                                           lpadmin(1M)

       allowed  on a new printer.  The login-ID-list argument may
       include any or all of the following constructs: a user  on
       the local system a user on system system-name all users on
       system system-name a user on all systems all users on  the
       local system all users on all systems

       For  each  printer the LP print service keeps two lists of
       users: an ``allow-list'' of  people  allowed  to  use  the
       printer,  and  a  ``deny-list'' of people denied access to
       the printer.  With the -u allow option, the  users  listed
       are  added  to  the  allow-list and removed from the deny-
       list.  With the -u deny option, the users listed are added
       to the deny-list and removed from the allow-list.

       If the allow-list is not empty, only the users in the list
       may use the printer, regardless of  the  contents  of  the
       deny-list.   If the allow-list is empty, but the deny-list
       is not, the  users  in  the  deny-list  may  not  use  the
       printer.  All users can be denied access to the printer by
       specifying -u deny:all.  All users may use the printer  by
       specifying -u allow:all.  This option is required when you
       are configuring a dial-up  printer  (a  printer  connected
       through a modem to your local print service).  It does not
       enable your print service to access a remote printer  ser-
       vice  (use  the  -s  option to do that).  Specifically, -U
       assigns  the  ``dialing''  information  dial-info  to  the
       printer.   dial-info is used with the dial routine to call
       the printer.  Any network connection supported by the Net-
       work Support Utilities will work.  dial-info can be either
       a phone number for a modem connection, or  a  system  name
       for  other  kinds  of  connections.   Or,  if -U direct is
       given, no dialing will take place, because the name direct
       is  reserved for a printer that is directly connected.  If
       a system name is given, it is used to search  for  connec-
       tion  details  from  the file /etc/uucp/Systems or related
       files.  This option is available only if the Network  Sup-
       port Utilities is installed on the system.  By default, -U
       direct is assumed.  This option is required when  you  are
       configuring  a local printer.  It associates a device with
       printer.  device  is  the  pathname  of  a  file  that  is
       writable  by lp.  Note that the same device can be associ-
       ated with more than one printer.

       When creating a new printer, one of three options (-v, -U,
       or  -s)  must  be  supplied.  In addition, only one of the
       following may be supplied: -e, -i, or -m; if none of these
       three options is supplied, the model standard is used.

       The -h and -l options are mutually exclusive.

       Printer  and class names may be no longer than the maximum
       length filename allowed for the filesystem  type  you  are
       using,  and may consist of all printable characters except

                                                                9

       the space,  slash,  backslash,  colon,  semicolon,  comma,
       asterisk,  question mark, and tilde.  The dash can be used
       in any position except the first  position  in  a  printer
       name.

       If  -s  and/or  -R is specified, the following options are
       invalid: -A, -e, -F, -h, -i, -l, -M, -m, -o, -U,  -v,  and
       -W.

       The -x dest option removes the destination dest (a printer
       or a class), from the LP print  service.   If  dest  is  a
       printer  and is the only member of a class, then the class
       will be deleted, too.  If dest is all,  all  printers  and
       classes  are  removed.   No other options are allowed with
       -x.

       Printers  should  be  assigned  an  appropriate  Mandatory
       Access Control (MAC) level range (if the Enhanced Security
       Utilities are installed) and correct user and group owner-
       ship and permission before being configured.

       The  owner  of  the  LP  device should be the user lp, the
       group ID of the device should be lp, and the  access  per-
       missions should be 600 (that is, read-write for the owner,
       with no permissions for group or other).  If these  access
       permissions  are  not correct, lpadmin will not accept the
       device.  A printer's MAC level should be determined by the
       security  of its location; if the printer will be used for
       sensitive data, access to it should be restricted.

       The admalloc command is used to define the  MAC  level  of
       the  printer  device  when  it  is allocated for use.  For
       information on the use of admalloc, see the  manual  page.
       You  must allocate the printer device with admalloc before
       configuring it with lpadmin.

       The -d [dest] option makes dest, an  existing  printer  or
       class, the new system default destination.  If dest is not
       supplied, then there is no system default destination.  No
       other  options  are  allowed with -d.  To unset the system
       default printer, the user can enter the keyword none.

       The -S print-wheel option is used with the  -A  alert-type
       option  to  define  an alert to mount the print wheel when
       there are jobs queued for it.  If this command is not used
       to  arrange  alerting  for a print wheel, no alert will be
       sent for the print wheel.  Note the other use of -A,  with
       the -p option, above.

       The  alert-types  are the same as those available with the

                                                               10

lpadmin(1M)                                           lpadmin(1M)

       -A option: mail, write, quiet,  none,  shell-command,  and
       list.  See the description of -A, above, for details about
       each.

       The message sent  appears  as  follows:  The  print  wheel
       print-wheel needs to be mounted on the printer(s): printer
       (integer1 requests) integer2  print  requests  await  this
       print  wheel.   The  printers  listed  are  those that the
       administrator had earlier specified  were  candidates  for
       this print wheel.  The number integer1 listed next to each
       printer  is  the  number  of  requests  eligible  for  the
       printer.  The number integer2 shown after the printer list
       is the total number of requests awaiting the print  wheel.
       It  will be less than the sum of the other numbers if some
       requests can be handled by more than one printer.

       If the print-wheel is all, the alerting  defined  in  this
       command  applies  to  all  print wheels already defined to
       have an alert.

       If the -W option is not given, the  default  procedure  is
       that  only  one message will be sent per need to mount the
       print wheel.  Not specifying the -W option  is  equivalent
       to  specifying  -W  once  or -W 0.  If minutes is a number
       greater than zero, an alert  will  be  sent  at  intervals
       specified by minutes.

       If  the  -Q  option  is also given, the alert will be sent
       when a certain number (specified by the argument requests)
       of  print  requests that need the print wheel are waiting.
       If the -Q option is not given, or requests  is  1  or  the
       word  any  (which are both the default), a message is sent
       as soon as anyone submits a print request  for  the  print
       wheel when it is not mounted.
