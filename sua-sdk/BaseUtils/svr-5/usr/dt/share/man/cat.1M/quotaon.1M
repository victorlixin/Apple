       quotaon announces to the system that disk quotas should be
       enabled on one or more filesystems.  The filesystems spec-
       ified  must  be mounted at the time.  The filesystem quota
       files must be present in the root directory of the  speci-
       fied filesystem and be named quotas.

       quotaoff  announces  to the system that filesystems speci-
       fied should have any disk quotas turned off.

       The quotaon and quotaoff commands are supported on the ufs
       and vxfs FStypes.

       The  options  are: Specify the FSType on which to operate.
       If -F FSType is not specified it is determined by matching
       the  inputfs device with an entry in /etc/vfstab.  If this
       fails, heuristics similiar to those used by  are  used  to
       determine  the  file  system type.  If the FSType is known
       beforehand, use  the  -F  option.  This  command  executes
       faster  if  it  is  not required to autodetect file system
       types.  Echo the complete command line, but do not execute
       the  command.   The command line is generated by using the
       options and arguments provided by the user and  adding  to
       them  information  derived  from /etc/vfstab.  This option
       should be used to verify and validate  the  command  line.
       Specify FSType-specific options.
