       ob  is  a menu-driven interface that automates many of the
       tasks involved  with  creating  an  object  service  agent
       (OSA).   The OSA itself comprises classes of objects to be
       managed, their attributes, and the operations that can  be
       performed  on  those  objects  and  attributes.  An OSA is
       divided into two files: the class definition  file,  which
       contains  class  definition  tables  (CDTs) for each class
       that define how objects of that class behave the execution
       procedure  file, which contains procedures which carry out
       object requests.  The OSA builder allows you to edit class
       definition files.  Although it does not provide facilities
       for editing the execution procedure file, it will generate
       a  file with procedure definitions (function stubs), which
       can act as a starting point for writing the needed  proce-
       dures.
