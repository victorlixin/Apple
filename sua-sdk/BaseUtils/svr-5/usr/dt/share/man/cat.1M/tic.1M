       The command tic translates a terminfo file from the source
       format into the compiled format.  The results  are  placed
       in  the  directory  /usr/share/lib/terminfo.  The compiled
       format is necessary for use with the library  routines  in
       specifies  that  (verbose)  output  be written to standard
       error  trace  information  showing  tic's  progress.   The
       optional  integer  n  is a number from 1 to 10, inclusive,
       indicating the desired level of detail of information.  If
       n  is  omitted, the default level is 1.  If n is specified
       and greater than 1, the  level  of  detail  is  increased.

       links are not detected.  contains  one  or  more  terminfo
       terminal  descriptions in source format (see Each descrip-
       tion in the file describes the capabilities of a  particu-
       lar  terminal.   When a use=entry-name field is discovered
       in a terminal entry currently being compiled, tic reads in
       the  binary  from  /usr/share/lib/terminfo to complete the
       entry.  (Entries created from file will be used first.  If
       the  environment  variable TERMINFO is set, that directory
       is  searched  instead  of  /usr/share/lib/terminfo.)   tic
       duplicates  the capabilities in entry-name for the current
       entry, with  the  exception  of  those  capabilities  that
       explicitly are defined in the current entry.

       If  the environment variable TERMINFO is set, the compiled
       results are placed there  instead  of  /usr/share/lib/ter-
       minfo.

       Total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes.  The name
       field cannot exceed 128 bytes.  Terminal  names  exceeding
       14  characters  will  be  truncated to 14 characters and a
       warning message will be printed.

       tic can translate a file including variables for  interna-
       tional  functionality  from  the source format to the com-
       piled format.

       tic also recognizes the environment variable TERMINFO with
       a  value  that  includes characters from the supplementary
       code sets as the path name for the compiled result.

       Entry names in files must be  in  single-byte  characters,
       since  the  compiled  result will be placed in a directory
       named using the first byte of the entry name.

       If  the Enhanced Security Utilities are installed and run-
       ning, privileged use of  this  command  is  restricted  to
       maintenance mode.

       When  an  entry,  for  example,  entry_name_1,  contains a
       use=entry_name_2  field,  any  canceled  capabilities   in
       entry_name_2  must also appear in entry_name_1 before use=
       for these capabilities to be canceled in entry_name_1.
