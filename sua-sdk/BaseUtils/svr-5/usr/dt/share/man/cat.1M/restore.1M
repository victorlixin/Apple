       The restore command provides a facility that  is  adequate
       for  restores  on  most small machines and machines with a
       minimal amount of software installed.

       Although some options cannot be  run  unless  a  user  has
       privileges  to  do  so,  some options to the basic restore
       command can be executed by any user without special privi-
       leges.

       The restore command cannot restore data that was backed up
       using the and commands.  Data backed up using  those  com-
       mands  should  be restored using the diskette created when
       running the emergency_disk command.

       A complete restore.  All files on the tape  are  restored.
       Indicates  that  the tape device is to be used.  device is
       the device special pathname to be used.   It  defaults  to
       /dev/rdsk/f0.   A raw device must be used to do multi-vol-
       ume restore operations.  Retrieve the index  file.   Over-
       write the existing file.

       If  a  backup  or restore is aborted or fails to complete,
       then in some cases the devices which were being  used  may
       be  left  reserved  to the original backup or restore pro-
       cess.  This may prevent subsequent backup or restore oper-
       ations  from  working.   You can check whether devices are
       reserved by typing: devreserv which reports  any  reserved
       devices,  with the process id of the process to which each
       is attached.  To free a reserved device for reuse,  enter:
       devfree pid where pid is the process id reported by devre-
       serv.

       If you are doing a restore operation on the UnixWare Desk-
       top,  and  are  restoring from a Release 1.1 backup onto a
       Release 2.0 system,  you  will  encounter  strange  system
       behavior.  Refer  to  the  Troubleshooting  section in the
       Installation Handbook for complete information.
