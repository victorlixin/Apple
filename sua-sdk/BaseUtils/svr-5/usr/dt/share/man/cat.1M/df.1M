       The df command  prints  the  allocation  portions  of  the
       generic  superblock for mounted or unmounted file systems,
       directories or mounted resources.  directory represents  a
       valid  directory  name.   If  directory  is  specified, df
       reports on the device that contains the  directory.   spe-
       cial   represents   a   special   device   (for   example,
       /dev/dsk/*f1,  where  *  is   implementation   dependent).
       resource  is  a NFS resource name.  If arguments to df are
       pathnames, df produces a report on the  file  system  con-
       taining the named file.

       The  df  command  reports  sizes  in  512 byte blocks.  It
       reports 2 blocks less free space,  rather  than  1  block,
       since the file uses one system block of 1-24 bytes.

       The directory /etc/fscmd.d/TYPE contains programs for each
       filesystem  type;  df  invokes  the  appropriate   binary.
       /etc/fscmd.d is linked to /etc/fs.

       current_options  are  options supported by the s5-specific
       module of df.  Other FSTypes do  not  necessarily  support
       these options.  specific_options indicate suboptions spec-
       ified in  a  comma-separated  list  of  suboptions  and/or
       keyword-attribute  pairs for interpretation by the FSType-
       specific module of the command.

       The generic options are:

       Specify the FSType on which to operate.  If -F  FSType  is
       not   specified   it   is   determined   by  matching  the
       mount_point,  special,  or  resource  with  an  entry   in
       /etc/vfstab.   If this fails, heuristics similiar to those
       used by are used to determine the file  system  type.   If
       the  FSType  is  known beforehand, use the -F option. This
       command executes faster if it is not required  to  autode-
       tect file system types.

       Print  only  the number of kilobytes free.  Print only the
       number of files free.  Print the entire statvfs structure.
       Used  only  for mounted file systems.  Cannot be used with
       current_options or with the -o option.  This option  over-
       rides the -b, -e, -k, -n, and -t options.  The numbers for
       available, total, and free blocks are reported in 512 byte
       blocks.  Display the total number of inodes, the number of
       free inodes, the number of used inodes, and the percentage

                                                                1

       of  inodes in use.  Print allocation in kilobytes.  Report
       on local file systems only.  Used only  for  mounted  file
       systems.  Can not be used with current_options or with the
       -o option.  Print only the FSType name.  Invoked  with  no
       arguments this option prints a list of mounted file system
       types.  Used only for mounted file systems.   Can  not  be
       used  with  current_options or with the -o option.  Causes
       total allocated block figures to be reported  as  well  as
       number  of  free  blocks.  Echo the complete command line,
       but do not execute the command.  The command line is  gen-
       erated  by using the options and arguments provided by the
       user and adding to them information derived from /etc/mnt-
       tab  or /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used to verify
       and validate the command line.  Format  output  to  follow
       POSIX.2 standards. Does so by giving headings and informa-
       tion on devices and filesystems.  Specify  FSType-specific
       options.   Reports  percent  of blocks used as well as the
       number of blocks used and free.  The -v option  cannot  be
       used with other options.

       If  no  arguments or options are specified, the free space
       on all local and remotely mounted file systems is printed.

       dfspace  is a shell script that uses the df command.  dfs-
       pace reports the available disk space for all mounted file
       systems  with the exception of pseudo file systems such as
       /proc.  dfspace reports the free disk space in mega  bytes
       and also as a percentage of total disk space.

       Without  arguments, dfspace reports the free disk space on
       all file systems.

       The option for dfspace is: find free disk space on  FSType
       file system.

       The -F option is intended for use with unmounted file sys-
       tems,  except  for  the bfs FSType.  df -F bfs is not sup-
       ported when /stand is not mounted.

       This command may not be supported for all FSTypes.

       If options -g or -n  are  used  when  there  are  remotely
       mounted  resources,  df  tries  to  determine  the  remote
       resource's file system type.  If it can be determined,  df
       prints the file system type; otherwise, it prints unknown.

       For NFS-mounted file systems, the df command may  show  -1
       for  one  or  more  fields. This is due to an NFS protocol

                                                                2

       deficiency which will be addressed in a future release.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
