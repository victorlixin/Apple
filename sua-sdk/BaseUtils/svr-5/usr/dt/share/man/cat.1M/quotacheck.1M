       quotacheck examines each filesystem,  builds  a  table  of
       current  disk  usage, and compares this table against that
       stored in the disk quota file for the filesystem.  If  any
       inconsistencies  are detected, both the quota file and the
       current system copy of the incorrect  quotas  are  updated
       (the  latter  only  occurs  if  an  active  filesystem  is
       checked).  quotacheck is supported on the ufs FStype.

       quotacheck expects each filesystem to be checked to have a
       quota  file  named  quotas in the root directory.  If that
       file is not present, quotacheck will ignore  the  filesys-
       tem.

       quotacheck accesses the character special device in calcu-
       lating the actual disk usage for  each  user.   Thus,  the
       filesystems  checked  should be quiescent while quotacheck
       is running.

       Specify the FSType on which to operate.  If -F  FSType  is
       not  specified  it  is  determined by matching the inputfs
       device with an  entry  in  /etc/vfstab.   If  this  fails,
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the file system type.  If the FSType is known  beforehand,
       use  the  -F option. This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system  types.   Echo  the
       complete  command  line,  but  do not execute the command.
       The command line is generated by  using  the  options  and
       arguments provided by the user and adding to them informa-
       tion derived from /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used
       to  verify and validate the command line.  Specify FSType-
       specific options.
