       deluser is used to remove a user ID from the system.  Once
       the ID has been removed, its owner  will  no  longer  have
       access to the system.  This is the login name for the user
       account that's being removed from the system.  This  argu-
       ment  determines whether or not the user's files should be
       saved when his or her login name is removed.

       If Yes is specified, all files in the user's  home  direc-
       tory  are copied to /lost+found/login_name before the home
       directory is removed.

       If No is specified, the files in $HOME  are  not  removed.
       This is the user's home directory.
