       acctcms reads one or more  files,  normally  in  the  form
       described  in  It adds all records for processes that exe-
       cuted identically-named commands, sorts them,  and  writes
       them  to  the  standard output, normally using an internal
       summary format.  The options are: Print  output  in  ASCII
       rather  than  in  the internal summary format.  The output
       includes command name, number  of  times  executed,  total
       kcore-minutes, total CPU minutes, total real minutes, mean
       size (in K), mean CPU minutes per invocation,  ``hog  fac-
       tor,''  characters  transferred, and blocks read and writ-
       ten, as in Output is normally sorted by  total  kcore-min-
       utes.   Sort  by  total CPU time, rather than total kcore-
       minutes.  Combine all commands  invoked  only  once  under
       ``***other.''  Sort by number of command invocations.  Any
       filenames encountered hereafter are  already  in  internal
       summary  format.   Process all records as total accounting
       records.  The default internal summary format splits  each
       field  into  prime  and non-prime time parts.  This option
       combines the prime and non-prime time parts into a  single
       field  that is the total of both, and provides upward com-
       patibility with old (that is, pre-UNIX  System  V  Release
       4.0) style acctcms internal summary format records.

       The following options may be used only with the -a option.
       Output a prime-time-only command summary.  Output  a  non-
       prime (offshift) time only command summary.

       When  -p and -o are used together, a combination prime and
       non-prime time report is produced.  All  the  output  sum-
       maries  will  be  total  usage except number of times exe-
       cuted, CPU minutes, and real minutes, which will be  split
       into prime and non-prime.

       A typical sequence for performing daily command accounting
       and for maintaining a running total is: acctcms file ... >
       today  cp total previoustotal acctcms -s today previousto-
       tal > total acctcms -a -s today

       Unpredictable output results if -t is used  on  new  style
       internal  summary  format files, or if it is not used with
       old style internal summary format files.
