       getdgrp  generates  a  list  of device groups that contain
       devices matching the given  criteria.   The  criteria  are
       given in the form of expressions.

       getdgrp  takes  the  following  options:  Specifies that a
       device must match all criteria before a  device  group  to
       which  it belongs can be included in the list generated by
       this command.  The flag has no effect if no  criteria  are
       defined.   Specifies that the list of device groups on the
       command line should be excluded from the list generated by
       this command.  (Without the -e the named device groups are
       the only ones which  can  be  included  in  the  generated
       list.)   The  flag  has  no effect if no device groups are
       defined.  Specifies that all device groups (subject to the
       -e  option  and the dgroup list) should be listed, even if
       they contain no valid device members.  This option has  no
       affect  if  criteria  are  specified  on the command line.
       Defines criteria that a device must match before a  device
       group to which it belongs can be included in the generated
       list.  Defines device groups which should be  included  in
       or  excluded from the generated list.  There are four pos-
       sible criteria expression types: Selects all device groups
       with  a member whose attribute attribute is defined and is
       equal to value.  Selects all device groups with  a  member
       whose  attribute  attribute  is defined and does not equal
       value.  Selects all device groups with a member which  has
       the  attribute  attribute  defined.   Selects  all  device
       groups with a member which does  not  have  the  attribute
       attribute  defined.   See  the  manual page for a complete
       listing and description of available attributes.

       getdgrp returns with one of the following values: Success-
       ful  completion  of  the  task.  Command syntax incorrect,
       invalid option used, or internal error  occurred.   Device
       table  or device group table could not be opened for read-

       criteria can be one expression or a  list  of  expressions
       which  a  device must meet for its group to be included in
       the list generated by getdgrp.  If you do  not  provide  a
       criteria, all device groups are included in the list.

       Devices  must  satisfy at least one of the criteria in the
       list.  However, the -a flag can be used to define  that  a

                                                                1

       "logical  and"  operation should be performed.  Then, only
       those groups containing devices which  match  all  of  the
       criteria in a list will be included.

       dgroup  defines  a  set of device groups to be included in
       the list.  Device groups that are defined and  which  con-
       tain devices matching the criteria are included.  However,
       if the -e flag is used, this list defines a set of  device
       groups  to  be  excluded.   When the -e option is used and
       criteria is also defined, the generated list will  include
       device  groups containing devices which match the criteria
       and are not in the command line list.
