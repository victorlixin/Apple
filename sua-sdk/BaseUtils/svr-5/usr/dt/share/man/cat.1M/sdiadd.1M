       The  script  is  used to hot add a SDI mass storage device
       (such as a disk or tape drive) to the &gemini; system.  It
       cannot be used to hot add a controller.

       sdiadd  takes  the following option and argument: Prevents
       sdiadd from prompting the user or quieting the  SCSI  bus.
       It  also allows the command to be run outside the console.
       This required argument specifies the new device  you  want
       to add.

       Hot addition/removal provides the ability to add or remove
       SDI mass storage devices from a running system.

       To use this feature, the HBA and target drivers must  sup-
       port hot addition/removal.

       To  add  a  device to the system: Choose a SCSI ID for the
       device, making sure it does not conflict with any  on  the
       SCSI  bus.   Failure  to  do this correctly will crash the
       system; this is  a  hardware  limitation  that  cannot  be
       addressed  in  software.  Ensure that adding the device to
       the system will  maintain  proper  SCSI  bus  termination.
       Failure  to  do this correctly will crash the system; this
       is also a hardware limitation that cannot be addressed  in
       software.

       To  simplify this problem, never have any termination on a
       device; instead, use terminators attached to  the  end  of
       the SCSI bus cable.  It is recommended that the device not
       provide termination power.  Most devices have a jumper  or
       switch  to  disable termpower.  Type /sbin/sdiadd.  Physi-
       cally attach the device to the SCSI bus.  Press  to inform
       sdiadd that the device has been added and that normal SCSI
       bus operation can resume.

       If you change the hard disk configuration on  your  system
       (for  example, you add or replace a hard disk), create new
       emergency recovery disks.  For details, see
