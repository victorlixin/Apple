       Accounting  software is structured as a set of tools (con-
       sisting of both C programs and shell procedures) that  can
       be used to build accounting systems.  describes the set of
       shell procedures built on top of the C programs.

       Connect time accounting is  handled  by  various  programs
       that write records into /var/adm/wtmp, as described in The
       programs described in convert this file into  session  and
       charging records, which are then summarized by

       Process accounting is performed by the

       system  kernel.  Upon termination of a process, one record
       per   process   is   written   to   a    file    (normally
       /var/adm/pacct).   The programs in summarize this data for
       charging purposes; is used  to  summarize  command  usage.
       Current process data may be examined using

       Process  accounting  and  connect  time accounting (or any
       accounting records in the tacct format described in can be
       merged  and  summarized  into  total accounting records by
       acctmerg.  prtacct (see is  used  to  format  any  or  all
       accounting records.

       acctdisk reads lines that contain user ID, login name, and
       number of disk blocks and converts them to total  account-
       ing  records  that  can  be  merged  with other accounting
       records.

       acctdusg reads its standard input  (usually  from  find  /
       -print)  and computes disk resource consumption (including
       indirect blocks) by login.  If -u is given,  records  con-
       sisting  of  those filenames for which acctdusg charges no
       one are placed in file (a  potential  source  for  finding
       users trying to avoid disk charges).  If -p is given, file
       is the name of the password  file.   This  option  is  not
       needed if the password file is /etc/passwd.  (See for more
       details.)

       accton alone turns process accounting  off.   If  file  is

                                                                1

       given,  it  must be the name of an existing file, to which
       the kernel appends process accounting records (see and

       acctwtmp writes a record  to  its  standard  output.   The
       record  contains  the current time and a string of charac-
       ters that describe the reason.  A record type of  ACCOUNT-
       ING  is  assigned  [see  reason  must be a string of 11 or
       fewer characters, numbers, ``$'', or spaces.  For example,
       the  following are suggestions for use in reboot and shut-
       down procedures,  respectively:  acctwtmp  "acctg  on"  >>
       /var/adm/wtmp  acctwtmp  "acctg  off" >> /var/adm/wtmp For
       each user currently logged  on,  closewtmp  puts  a  false
       DEAD_PROCESS  record in the /var/adm/wtmp file.  uses this
       false DEAD_PROCESS record so that the  connect  accounting
       procedures  can  track  the  time  used by users logged on
       before runacct was invoked.

       For each user currently logged on, runacct uses  utmp2wtmp
       to  create  an entry in the file /var/adm/wtmp, created by
       runacct.  Entries in /var/adm/wtmp enable subsequent invo-
       cations  of  runacct to account for connect times of users
       currently logged in.
