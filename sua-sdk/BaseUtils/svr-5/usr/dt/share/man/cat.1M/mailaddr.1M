       Mail addresses are based on RFC 822 except for the limita-
       tions listed at  the  end  of  this  manual  page.   These
       addresses  are  in  the general format user@domain where a
       domain is a hierarchical dot separated list of subdomains.
       For  example, the address stevea@fred.yoyodyne.com is nor-
       mally interpreted from right to left: the  message  should
       go  to  the  yoyodyne gateway, after which it should go to
       the local host fred. When the message reaches fred  it  is
       delivered to the user stevea.

       Unlike some other forms of addressing, this does not imply
       any routing. Thus, although this address is  specified  as
       an  RFC 822 address, it might travel by an alternate route
       if that were more convenient or efficient.   For  example,
       at  yoyodyne,  the  associated  message  would probably go
       directly to fred over the Ethernet rather than  going  via
       the yoyodyne mail gateway.

       Under  certain  circumstances  it  may not be necessary to
       type the entire domain name. In general, anything  follow-
       ing  the first dot may be omitted if it is the same as the
       domain from which you are sending the message.  For  exam-
       ple,  a  user  on  ``barney.yoyodyne.com''  could  send to
       ``stevea@fred'' without adding the ``yoyodyne.com''  since
       it is the same on both sending and receiving hosts.

       Certain  other  abbreviations  may be permitted as special
       cases. For example, at yoyodyne,  Internet  hosts  may  be
       referenced  without adding the ``yoyodyne.com'' as long as
       their names do not conflict with a local host name.

       Certain old address formats are converted to the new  for-
       mat  to  provide compatibility with the previous mail sys-
       tem.  In  particular,  user@host.ARPA   is   allowed   and
       host:user  is converted to user@host to be consistent with
       the command.

       Also, the syntax host!user is converted to user@host.UUCP

       This is normally converted back to the ``host!user''  form
       before being sent on for compatibility with older hosts.

       The  current  implementation  is  unable to route messages
       automatically through the  network. Until that  time,  you
       must  explicitly  tell the mail system which hosts to send
       your message through to get to your final destination.

       Domain names (that is, anything after the @ sign)  may  be
       given  in  any  mixture  of  upper- and lowercase with the
       exception of  hostnames. Most hosts accept any combination

                                                                1

       TICS sites.

       Under some circumstances it may be necessary  to  route  a
       message  through several hosts to get it to the final des-
       tination. Normally this routing is done automatically, but
       sometimes  it  is desirable to route the message manually.
       Addresses which show  these  relays  are  termed  ``route-
       addrs.''  These use the syntax: <@hosta,@hostb:user@hostc>
       This specifies that the message should be sent  to  hosta,
       from  there  to  hostb, and finally to hostc. This path is
       forced even if there is a more efficient path to hostc.

       Route-addrs occur frequently on  return  addresses,  since
       these  are  generally  augmented  by  the software at each
       host.  It is generally possible  to  ignore  all  but  the
       ``user@domain''  part  of  the  address  to  determine the
       actual sender.

       Every site is required to have a user or user alias desig-
       nated  ``postmaster'' to which problems with the mail sys-
       tem may be addressed.

       Some other networks can be reached by giving the  name  of
       the  network  as the last component of the domain. This is
       not a standard feature and may not  be  supported  at  all
       sites.  For example, messages to CSNET or BITNET sites can
       often  be  sent  to  user@host.CSNET  or  user@host.BITNET
       respectively.

       The RFC 822 group syntax (group:user1,user2,user3;) is not
       supported  except  in  the  special  case  of  ``group:;''
       because of a conflict with old berknet-style addresses.

       - and RFC 822-style addresses do not coexist politely.
