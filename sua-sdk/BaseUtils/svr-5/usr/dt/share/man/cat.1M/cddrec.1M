       cddrec  lists  the  contents of the directory record for a
       CD-ROM file or directory.

       cddrec produces a table that lists the names of the fields
       in  the  Directory  Record  and  their  values.  If the -b
       option is not used, the System Use  field  is  not  listed
       because it may contain non-printable characters.

       File  or  directory  within  the CD-ROM file system.  File
       Section for which the Directory Record should be read. The
       numbering  starts with one. If this option is omitted, the
       last File Section of that file is assumed.  Lists the con-
       tents  of  the  Directory Record, including the System Use
       Field, in binary format.

       If LC_TIME (which determines the format  and  contents  of
       the  date  and  time  strings) is not set or is set to the
       empty string, then cddrec uses the value of LANG.  If LANG
       is not set, or is set to the empty string, cddrec uses the
       value from the implementation-specific default locale.  If
       both  LC_TIME  and  LANG  contain invalid settings, cddrec
       behaves as if all of the variables are undefined.
