       The  du  command  gives  the number of sectors (512 bytes)
       contained  in  all  files  and  (recursively)  directories
       within each directory and file specified.  The block count
       includes the indirect blocks of the file.  If no names are
       given, the current directory is used.

       A  user with the appropriate privileges is able to display
       information about all files and directories.

       du has been multithreaded and uses the enhanced nftw  (see
       (walk a file tree) to increase its execution speed.

       The optional arguments are as follows: Give only the grand
       total (for each of the specified names).  Generate an out-
       put  line  for  each file.  Give block count in kilobytes.
       Cause block count returned to not follow  symbolic  links.
       If neither -s or -a is specified, an output line is gener-
       ated for each directory  only.   Generate  messages  about
       directories  that  cannot  be  read,  files that cannot be
       opened, and so on, rather than being silent (the default).
       A file with two or more links is only counted once.

       If POSIX2 is set, error messages are always reported (that
       is, the command behaves as if  the  -r  option  is  always
       specified).

       du only reports disk usage of file types that have backing
       store (for example, regular, directory, and symbolic  link
       files).  Other types of files (for example, pipes, charac-
       ter special files, block special files), will show a  disk
       usage of zero bytes.

       If  the  -a  option  is not used, non-directories given as
       arguments are not listed.

       If there are links between files in different  directories
       where the directories are on separate branches of the file
       system hierarchy, du counts the  excess  files  more  than
       once.

       This command has been updated to handle files greater than
       2GB.
