       The lpforms command is  used  to  administer  the  use  of
       preprinted  forms,  such as company letterhead paper, with
       the LP print service.  A form is specified  by  its  form-
       name.   Users  may  specify a form when submitting a print
       request (see The argument all can be used instead of form-
       name  with  either  of the command lines shown above.  The
       first  command  line  allows  the  administrator  to  add,
       change,  and  delete  forms,  to list the attributes of an
       existing form, and to allow and deny users access to  par-
       ticular  forms.  The second command line is used to estab-
       lish the method by which the administrator is alerted that
       the form form-name must be mounted on a printer.

       With  the first lpforms command line, one of the following
       options must be used: to add or change form form-name,  as
       specified  by the information in pathname to add or change
       form form-name, as specified by the information from stan-
       dard  input  to delete form form-name (this option must be
       used separately; it may not be used with any other option)
       to list the attributes of form form-name

       The  -F  pathname  option is used to add a new form, form-
       name, to the LP print service, or to change the attributes
       of  an  existing form.  The form description is taken from
       pathname if the -F option is given, or from  the  standard
       input  if  the - option is used.  One of these two options
       must be used to define or change a form.  pathname is  the
       pathname  of a file that contains all or any subset of the
       following information about the form: Page length: scaled-
       decimal-number1  Page width: scaled-decimal-number2 Number
       of pages: integer Line pitch: scaled-decimal-number3 Char-
       acter  pitch: scaled-decimal-number4 Character set choice:
       character-set/print-wheel [mandatory] Ribbon  color:  rib-
       bon-color  Comment:  comment  Alignment pattern: [content-
       type] content The term ``scaled-decimal-number'' refers to
       a  non-negative  number  used  to indicate a unit of size.
       The type  of  unit  is  shown  by  a  ``trailing''  letter
       attached  to  the  number.   Three types of scaled decimal
       numbers can be used with the  LP  print  service:  numbers
       that show sizes in centimeters (marked with a trailing c);
       numbers that show sizes in inches (marked with a  trailing
       i);  and  numbers  that show sizes in units appropriate to
       use (without a trailing letter), that is,  lines,  charac-
       ters, lines per inch, or characters per inch.

       Except  for the last two lines, the above lines may appear
       in any order.  The Comment and comment items  must  appear

                                                                1

lpforms(1M)                                           lpforms(1M)

       in  consecutive  order  but  may  appear  before the other
       items, and the Alignment pattern  and  the  content  items
       must  appear  in consecutive order at the end of the file.
       Also, the comment item may not contain a line that  begins
       with  any  of the key phrases above, unless the key phrase
       is preceded with a >.  Any leading >  sign  found  in  the
       comment  will  be  removed  when the comment is displayed.
       Case distinctions in the key phrases are ignored.

       When this command is issued, the form specified  by  form-
       name  is  added to the list of forms.  If the form already
       exists, its description is  changed  to  reflect  the  new
       information.  Once added, a form is available for use in a
       print request, except where access to the  form  has  been
       restricted,  as described under the -u option.  A form may
       also be allowed to be used on certain printers only.

       A description of each  form  attribute  is  below:  Before
       printing the content of a print request needing this form,
       the generic interface program provided with the  LP  print
       service  will  initialize  the  physical printer to handle
       pages scaled-decimal-number1 long, and scaled-decimal-num-
       ber2  wide  using  the printer type as a key into the ter-
       minfo database.  The page length and page width will  also
       be  passed,  if possible, to each filter used in a request
       needing this form.  Each time  the  alignment  pattern  is
       printed, the LP print service will attempt to truncate the
       content to a single form by, if possible, passing to  each
       filter  the page subset of 1-integer.  Before printing the
       content of a print request needing this form,  the  inter-
       face programs provided with the LP print service will ini-
       tialize the physical  printer  to  handle  these  pitches,
       using  the  printer  type  as  a  key  into  the  terminfo
       database.  Also, the pitches will be passed, if  possible,
       to  each  filter  used  in  a  request  needing this form.
       scaled-decimal-number3 is in lines per centimeter if  a  c
       is  appended,  and  lines  per  inch otherwise; similarly,
       scaled-decimal-number4 is in characters per centimeter  if
       a  c  is appended, and characters per inch otherwise.  The
       character pitch can also be given as elite (12  characters
       per  inch),  pica  (10 characters per inch), or compressed
       (as many characters per inch as possible).   When  the  LP
       print  service alerts an administrator to mount this form,
       it will also mention  that  the  print  wheel  print-wheel
       should  be  used on those printers that take print wheels.
       If printing with this form is to be done on a printer that
       has selectable or loadable character sets instead of print
       wheels, the interface programs provided with the LP  print
       service  will  automatically  select  or  load the correct
       character set.  If mandatory is appended, a  user  is  not
       allowed  to  select a different character set for use with
       the form; otherwise, the  character  set  or  print  wheel
       named  is  a  suggestion  and a default only.  When the LP
       print service alerts an administrator to mount this  form,

                                                                2

       it  will  also mention that the color of the ribbon should
       be ribbon-color.  The LP print service  will  display  the
       comment  unaltered  when  a user asks about this form (see
       When mounting this form an administrator can ask  for  the
       content  to  be printed repeatedly, as an aid in correctly
       positioning the preprinted form.   The  optional  content-
       type  defines  the  type  of printer for which content had
       been generated.  If content-type is not given,  simple  is
       assumed.   Note  that  the content is stored as given, and
       will be readable only by the user lp.   When  an  existing
       form  is  changed  with this command, items missing in the
       new information are left as they were.  When a new form is
       added  with  this command, missing items will get the fol-
       lowing defaults: Page Length: 66 Page Width: 80 Number  of
       Pages:  1  Line Pitch: 6 Character Pitch: 10 Character Set
       Choice: any Ribbon Color: any

       The -x option is used to delete the  form  form-name  from
       the LP print service.

       The -l option is used to list the attributes of the exist-
       ing form form-name.  Because of the potentially  sensitive
       nature  of  the  alignment pattern, only the administrator
       can examine the form with this command.  Other people  may
       use  the  lpstat command to examine the non-sensitive part
       of the form description.

       The -u option, followed by  the  argument  allow:login-ID-
       list  or  -u deny:login-ID-list  lets  you determine which
       users will be allowed to specify a particular form with  a
       print  request.   This option can be used with the -F or -
       option.

       The login-ID-list argument may include any or all  of  the
       following constructs: a user on the local system a user on
       system system-name all users on system system-name a  user
       on  all systems all users on the local system all users on
       all systems The default value of login-ID-list is all.

       The LP print service keeps two lists  of  users  for  each
       form: an ``allow-list'' of people allowed to use the form,
       and a ``deny-list'' of people that may not use  the  form.
       if  allow-list is present and login-ID is in it, access is
       allowed if only deny-list is present and login-ID  is  not
       in  it,  access  is  allowed  if login-ID is in deny-list,
       access is denied if neither allow-list  or  deny-list  are
       present,  access  is denied if both lists are present, and
       login-ID is in neither, access is denied  if  only  allow-
       list  is  present  and  login-ID  is  not in it, access is
       denied If the allow-list is not empty, only the  users  in
       the list are allowed access to the form, regardless of the

                                                                3

       contents of the deny-list.  If the allow-list is empty but
       the  deny-list  is not, the users in the deny-list may not
       use the form (but all others may use it).

       All users can be denied access to a form by specifying  -f
       deny:all.   All  users  can be allowed access to a form by
       specifying -f allow:all.  (This is the default.)

       The -f form-name option is used  with  the  -A  alert-type
       option to define an alert to mount the form when there are
       queued jobs which need it.  If this option is not used  to
       arrange  alerting  for  a  form, no alert will be sent for
       that form.

       The method by which the alert is sent depends on the value
       of  the  alert-type argument specified with the -A option.
       The alert types are the same as those available  with  the
       -A option to lpadmin: mail, write, quiet, none, shell-com-
       mand, and list.  See the description of -A on for  details
       about each.

       The  message  sent  appears as follows: The form form-name
       needs to be mounted
       on the printer(s): printer (integer1 requests).   integer2
       print requests await this form.  Use the ribbon-color rib-
       bon.  Use the print-wheel  print  wheel,  if  appropriate.
       The  printers  listed are those that the administrator had
       earlier specified were candidates for this form.  The num-
       ber  integer1 listed next to each printer is the number of
       requests eligible for the printer.   The  number  integer2
       shown  after  the  list of printers is the total number of
       requests awaiting the form.  It will be less than the  sum
       of  the  other  numbers if some requests can be handled by
       more than one printer.  The ribbon-color  and  print-wheel
       are  those  specified  in  the form description.  The last
       line in the message is always sent, even if  none  of  the
       printers  listed use print wheels, because the administra-
       tor may choose to mount the form on a  printer  that  does
       use a print wheel.

       Where any color ribbon or any print wheel can be used, the
       statements above will  read:  Use  any  ribbon.   Use  any
       print-wheel.  If form-name is any, the alerting defined in
       this command applies to any form for which  an  alert  has
       not  yet  been defined.  If form-name is all, the alerting
       defined in this command applies to all forms.

       If the -W option is not given, the  default  procedure  is
       that  only  one message will be sent per need to mount the
       form.  Not specifying the -W option is equivalent to spec-
       ifying  -W  once  or -W 0.  If minutes is a number greater
       than 0, an alert will be sent at  intervals  specified  by
       minutes.

                                                                4

lpforms(1M)                                           lpforms(1M)

       If  the  -Q  option  is also given, the alert will be sent
       when a certain number (specified by the argument requests)
       of  print requests that need the form are waiting.  If the
       -Q option is not given, or the value of requests is  1  or
       any  (which  are  both  the default), a message is sent as
       soon as anyone submits a print request for the  form  when
       it is not mounted.

       The  -f option, followed by the -A option and the argument
       list is used to list the  type  of  alert  that  has  been
       defined  for  the  specified form form-name.  No change is
       made to the alert.  If form-name is recognized by  the  LP
       print  service,  one of the following lines is sent to the
       standard output, depending on the type of  alert  for  the
       form.   When  requests  requests  are  queued:  alert with
       shell-command every minutes minutes

       When requests requests  are  queued:  write  to  user-name
       every minutes minutes

       When requests requests are queued: mail to user-name every
       minutes minutes

       No alert The phrase every minutes minutes is replaced with
       once if minutes (-W minutes) is 0.

       The  -A quiet option is used to stop messages for the cur-
       rent condition.  An administrator can use this  option  to
       temporarily  stop receiving further messages about a known
       problem.   Once  the  form  has  been  mounted  and   then
       unmounted,  messages will again be sent when the number of
       print requests reaches the threshold requests.

       No messages will be sent after the -A none option is  used
       until  the  -A   option  is  given  again with a different
       alert-type.  This can be used to permanently stop  further
       messages  from being sent as any existing alert definition
       for the form will be removed.
