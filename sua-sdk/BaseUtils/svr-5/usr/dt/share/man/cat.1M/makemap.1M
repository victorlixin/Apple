       makemap  creates  the  database maps used by the keyed map
       lookups in It reads input from the standard input and out-
       puts to the indicated mapname.

       Depending  on  how  it  is compiled, makemap handles up to
       three different database formats, selected using the  map-
       type  parameter.   The formats are: DBM format maps.  This
       requires the library.  B-Tree format maps.  This  requires
       the new Berkeley DB library.  Hash format maps.  This also
       requires the DB library.

       In all cases, makemap reads lines from the standard input,
       consisting  of  two  words  separated by white space.  The
       first is the database key; the second is the  value.   The
       value may contain %n strings to indicate parameter substi-
       tution.  Literal percents should be doubled  (%%).   Blank
       lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.

       If  the TrustedUser option is set in the sendmail configu-
       ration file and makemap is invoked as root, the  generated
       files will be owned by the specified TrustedUser.

       Use  the specified sendmail configuration file for looking
       up the TrustedUser option.  Include  the  null  byte  that
       terminates  strings  in  the  map.  This must match the -N
       flag in the sendmail.cf K line.  Allow duplicate  keys  in
       the  map.  This is only allowed on B-Tree format maps.  If
       two identical keys are read, they will  both  be  inserted
       into  the map.  Allow empty value (right hand side).  Nor-
       mally, all uppercase letters in the key are folded to low-
       ercase.   This  flag  disables  that  behavior.   This  is
       intended to mesh with the -f flag in the K line  in  send-
       mail.cf.   The  value  is never case-folded.  Append to an
       old file.  This allows you to augment  an  existing  file.
       Allow  replacement  of  existing  keys.  Normally, makemap
       complains if you repeat a key, and does  not  perform  the
       insert.  Ignore safety checks on maps being created.  This
       includes checking for hard  or  symbolic  links  in  world
       writable  directories.   dump  (unmap)  the content of the
       database to standard output.  Verbosely print what makemap
       is doing.
