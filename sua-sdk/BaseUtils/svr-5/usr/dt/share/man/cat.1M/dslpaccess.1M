       The dslpaccess utility either  allows  or  denies  conven-
       tional  (that is, not directory-enabled) users and systems
       access to a directory-enabled print queue. It  is  modeled
       on  the utility's -u option. Setting this does not control
       the access permissions of directory-enabled  users,  which
       is  done using appropriate directory server-specific tools
       such as ACL management systems.

       Allow and deny lists consist of a comma-separated list  of
       entries, each of which may specify a login ID, or a system
       name      and      login       ID,       as       follows:
       [[login-ID]|[system!login-ID]],[[login-ID]|[system!login-ID]],...
       login_ID or system, or both, can be set  to  the  wildcard
       all,  allowing or denying all appropriate entries. Use all
       with care. When the all entry is added to  one  list,  all
       non-all  entries  are removed from the other list, for the
       appropriate value of login_ID or system. The  default  for
       system is the local host.

       The  user  of  this  utility must be directory-enabled and
       have permissions set for write, modify, search and read on
       the  directory, in the directory context in which they are
       administrator.

       The utility has the following command line options: Speci-
       fies a list of users to add to the allow list. If present,
       these are deleted from the deny list. This option can  not
       be  used with the -d option.  Specifies the directory con-
       text for the command. This is the root Distinguished  Name
       (DN) to which the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) of the
       printer queue is added. If this is not given, the  current
       directory  context  is used.  Specifies a list of users to
       add to the deny list. If present, these are  deleted  from
       the  allow  list.  This option can not be used with the -a
       option.  The queue-name parameter is the RDN of the  print
       queue.  If  the  print  queue  name  does not exist in the
       directory context (see the -C option), the command  fails.

       On  success,  dslpaccess  returns  0, otherwise one of the
       following exit codes is returned: invalid  options  speci-

       The  following  grants  user  fredb  access to print queue
       printq1  on  host  systemX:  dslpaccess  -q   printq1   -a

                                                                1

       systemX!fredb  The  following performs the same operation,
       but for  a  specified  directory  context:  dslpaccess  -q
       printq1 -C "ou=mygroup,o=sco" -a systemX!fredb The follow-
       ing denies access to print queue printq1 to user tomt  for
       all hosts: dslpaccess -q printq1 -d all!tomt
