       acctprc reads standard input, in the form described by and
       converts it to total accounting  records  (see  the  tacct
       record  in  acctprc  divides  CPU time into prime time and
       non-prime time and determines mean memory size (in  memory
       segment   units).    acctprc  then  summarizes  the  tacct
       records, according to user IDs, and adds login names  cor-
       responding  to  the  user IDs.  The summarized records are
       then written to standard output.  acctprc1 reads input  in
       the  form  described  by adds login names corresponding to
       user IDs, then writes for each process an ASCII line  giv-
       ing  user ID, login name, prime CPU time (tics), non-prime
       CPU time (tics), and mean memory size (in  memory  segment
       units).   If  ctmp  is  given, it is expected to contain a
       list of login sessions sorted by user ID and  login  name.
       If  this file is not supplied, it obtains login names from
       the password file, just as acctprc does.  The  information
       in ctmp helps it distinguish between different login names
       sharing the same user ID.

       From standard input, acctprc2 reads records  in  the  form
       written  by acctprc1, summarizes them according to user ID
       and name, then writes the sorted summaries to the standard
       output as total accounting records.

       The  acctprc  command  is  typically  used as shown below:
       acctprc < /var/adm/pacct > ptacct The acctprc1  and  acct-
       prc2  commands are typically used as shown below: acctprc1
       ctmp < /var/adm/pacct | acctprc2 > ptacct

       Although it is possible for acctprc1 to distinguish  among
       login names that share user IDs for commands run normally,
       it is difficult to do this for those commands run from for
       example.   A more precise conversion can be done using the
       acctwtmp program in acctprc does not  distinguish  between
       users with identical user IDs.

       A memory segment of the mean memory size is a unit of mea-
       sure for the number of bytes in a logical  memory  segment
       on a particular processor.
