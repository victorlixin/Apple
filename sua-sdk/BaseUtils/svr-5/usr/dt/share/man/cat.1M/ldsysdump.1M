       The  ldsysdump  command  loads the memory image files from
       the floppy diskettes or cartridge tape used to take a sys-
       tem  dump  and  recombines  them into a single file on the
       hard disk suitable for use by the crash command.  The des-
       tination_file is the name of the hard disk file into which
       the data from the diskettes will be loaded.

       When executed, ldsysdump begins an  interactive  procedure
       that  prompts  the user to insert the diskettes or tape to
       be loaded.  The user has the option of quitting  the  ses-
       sion  at  any  time.   This allows only the portion of the
       system image needed to be dumped.

       If a floppy diskette is inserted out of sequence a message
       is  printed.   The user is allowed to insert a new one and
       continue the session.

       The file size limit must be set large enough to  hold  the
       dump.
