       The dslpaccept and dslpreject utilities are used to set  a
       print  queue  so  that  it  will  accept  or  reject print
       requests being queued for it. Unlike  the  and  utilities,
       the  directory-enabled  utilities can control remote print
       systems, so long as they are  directory-enabled.  This  is
       because  they  write directly to the print queue object on
       the directory server.  Print  requests  that  are  already
       queued are not affected by the dslpreject utility.

       The  print-queue-name  parameter  is  the RDN of the print
       queue object. If the specified print queue does not  exist
       in  the  directory  context (as set by the -C option), the
       command fails.  Multiple print  queue  names  may  form  a
       comma-separated list.

       The  user  of  this  utility must be directory-enabled and
       have permissions set for write, modify, search and read on
       the  directory, in the directory context in which they are
       administrator.

       The following command line options are supported by  these
       utilities:  The  directory-context  argument specifies the
       directory context for which  the  command  is  valid.  For
       example, the command changes the status of the print queue
       whose RDN has been specified by  the  print-queue-name  in
       the  directory context. If the -C option is not given, the
       current directory context is used.  Assigns a  reason  for
       the  rejection.  Strings  containing  whitespace should be
       double quoted.

       This is a string that is  displayed  by  the  command.  No
       default reason is set when one is not specified.

       On  success, dslpaccept and dslpreject return 0, otherwise
       one of the  following  exit  codes  is  returned:  invalid

       not have modify permissions invalid DN supplied  value  is
