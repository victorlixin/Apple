       One of  the  ID/TP  kernel  configuration  tools,  idspace
       checks  whether  sufficient free space exists to perform a
       kernel reconfiguration (see By default, idspace checks the
       number  of  available  disk  blocks  and  inodes  in three
       filesystems: / and, if they exist, /usr, and /tmp.

       The default tests performed by idspace  are:  Verify  that
       the  root filesystem (/) has 400 blocks more than the size
       of the current /stand/unix.  This verifies that  a  device
       driver being added to the current /stand/unix can be built
       and placed in the root filesystem.  idspace also checks to
       ensure  that  100  inodes  exist  in  the  root directory.
       Determine whether a /usr filesystem exists.   If  it  does
       exist,  idspace  checks  whether  400  free blocks and 100
       inodes are available  in  the  /usr  filesystem.   If  the
       filesystem  does  not  exist,  idspace  does not report an
       error, however, because  files  created  in  /usr  by  the
       reconfiguration process will be created in the parent root
       filesystem, and space  requirements  are  covered  by  the
       idspace  test of the root filesystem.  Determine whether a
       /tmp filesystem exists.  If it does exist, idspace  checks
       whether  400  free  blocks and 100 inodes are available in
       the /tmp filesystem.   As  with  the  test  for  the  /usr
       filesystem, if the /tmp filesystem does not exist, idspace
       does not report an error, because files created in /tmp by
       the  reconfiguration  process  will be created in the root
       filesystem, and space  requirements  are  covered  by  the
       idspace test of the root filesystem.

       idspace  takes the following options: Override the default
       test for 100 inodes for all three of the idspace  filesys-
       tem  space  checks,  and  test for the specified number of
       inodes instead.  Override the default test for /stand/unix
       size  +  400 blocks when checking the root (/) filesystem,
       and test for the specified number of blocks instead.  When
       the  -r  option is used, the /usr and /tmp filesystems are
       not tested.  Override the default test for 400 blocks when
       checking  the  /usr filesystem, and test for the specified
       number of blocks instead.  When the -u option is used, the
       root  (/) and /tmp filesystems are not tested.  If /usr is
       not a separate filesystem, an error is reported.  Override
       the  default  test  for  400 blocks when checking the /tmp
       filesystem, and test for the specified  number  of  blocks
       instead.   When  the  -t  option is used, the root (/) and
       /usr filesystems are not tested.  If /tmp is not  a  sepa-
       rate filesystem, an error is reported.

                                                                1

       An  exit value of zero indicates success.  If insufficient
       space exists in a filesystem or an error  was  encountered
       due to a syntax or format error, idspace reports the error
       in a message.  The specific exit values  are  as  follows:
       successful completion command syntax error, or needed file
       does not exist filesystem has insufficient space or inodes
       requested  filesystem  does  not  exist (-u and -t options
       only)
