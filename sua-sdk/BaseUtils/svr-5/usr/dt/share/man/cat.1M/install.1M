       The install command is most  commonly  used  in  makefiles
       (see to install a file (updated target file) in a specific
       place within a filesystem.   Each  file  is  installed  by
       copying it into the appropriate directory, thereby retain-
       ing the mode and owner of the original command.  The  pro-
       gram  prints  messages telling the user exactly what files
       it is replacing or creating and where they are going.

       If no options or  directories  (dirx  . . .)   are  given,
       install  will  search  a set of default directories (/bin,
       /usr/bin, /etc, /lib, and /usr/lib, in that order)  for  a
       file  with  the  same name as file.  When the first occur-
       rence is found, install issues a message saying that it is
       overwriting  that  file  with file, and proceeds to do so.
       If the file is not found,  the  program  states  this  and
       exits without further action.

       If one or more directories (dirx ...)  are specified after
       file, those directories will be searched before the direc-
       tories specified in the default list.

       Installs  a  new command (file) in the directory specified
       by dira, only if it is not found.  If it is found, install
       issues  a message saying that the file already exists, and
       exits without overwriting it.  May be used alone  or  with
       the  -s  option.   Forces  file  to  be installed in given
       directory, whether or not one already exists.  If the file
       being installed does not already exist, the mode and owner
       of the new file will be set to 755 and bin,  respectively.
       If  the  file  already  exists, the mode and owner will be
       that of the already existing file.  May be used  alone  or
       with  the  -o  or  -s  options.  Ignores default directory
       list, searching only through the given directories (dirx .
       . . ).  May be used alone or with any other options except
       -c and -f.  If file is not found in any  of  the  searched
       directories, it is put in the directory specified in dirc.
       The mode and owner of the new file will be set to 755  and
       bin,  respectively.   May  be used alone or with any other
       options except -c and -f.  The mode of the new file is set
       to  mode.   The owner of the new file is set to user.  The
       group id of the new file is set to group.  Only  available
       to the superuser.  If file is found, this option saves the
       ``found'' file by copying it to OLDfile in  the  directory
       in  which  it  was  found.   This  option  is  useful when
       installing a frequently  used  file  such  as  /bin/sh  or
       /lib/saf/ttymon,   where   the  existing  file  cannot  be
       removed.  May be used alone  or  with  any  other  options

                                                                1

       except  -c.   Suppresses  printing  of messages other than
       error messages.  May be  used  alone  or  with  any  other
       options.
