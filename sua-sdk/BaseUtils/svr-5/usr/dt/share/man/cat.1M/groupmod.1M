       The groupmod command modifies the definition of the speci-
       fied group by  modifying  the  appropriate  entry  in  the
       /etc/group file.

       The  following options are available: The group ID for the
       new group.  This group ID must be a  non-negative  decimal
       integer  below  MAXUID as defined in <param.h>.  The group
       ID defaults to the next available  (unique)  number  above
       99.   (Group IDs from 0-99 are reserved.)  The pathname of
       a  directory   containing   two   customization   scripts,
       groupadd.pre  and groupadd.post, to be executed before and
       after  modification  of  the  group,  respectively.   This
       option  allows  the  gid to be duplicated (non-unique).  A
       string of printable characters that specifies a  new  name
       for  the group.  It may not include a colon (:) or newline
       (\n).  The current name of the group to be  modified.   If
       group  is  preceded  by  a +, (for example, +student), the
       group definition is administered by the  Network  Informa-
       tion  Service (NIS).  In this case, the value for group ID
       will be taken from the NIS database.  For such  specifica-
       tions,  use  of  the  -g or -o options will cause a syntax
       error to be returned.  See for more information.
