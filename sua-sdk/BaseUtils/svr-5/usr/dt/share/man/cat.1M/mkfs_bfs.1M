       mkfs  is used to create a boot filesystem, which is a con-
       tiguous flat filesystem, to hold the bootable programs and
       data files necessary for the boot procedure.

       The  argument  special  is  the  device  special file that
       refers to the partition on which the filesystem is  to  be
       created.

       The  size  argument  is  used  to  specify the size of the
       filesystem.  The block size is automatically 512 bytes.

       The maximum size of a  bfs  filesystem  is  128  MB.   The
       inodes  argument  specifies  the  number of files that the
       filesystem will hold.

       This filesystem is intended to hold the bootable files and
       data  files for the boot procedure.  Use as a general pur-
       pose filesystem is not recommended.
