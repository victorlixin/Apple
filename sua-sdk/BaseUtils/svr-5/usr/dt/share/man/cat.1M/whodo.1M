       whodo produces formatted and dated output from information
       in the /var/adm/utmp, /etc/ps_data, and /proc/pid files.

       The display is headed by the date, time, and machine name.
       For  each  user  logged in, device name, user-ID and login
       time is shown, followed by  a  list  of  active  processes
       associated with the user-ID.  The list includes the device
       name, process-ID, CPU minutes and seconds used,  and  pro-
       cess name.

       If user is specified, output is restricted to all sessions
       pertaining to that user.

       The following options are available: Suppress the heading.
       Produce  a  long form of output. The fields displayed are:
       the user's login name, the name of the tty the user is on,
       the time of day the user logged in (in hours:minutes), the
       idle time -- that is, the time since the user  last  typed
       anything (in hours:minutes), the CPU time used by all pro-
       cesses and  their  children  on  that  terminal  (in  min-
       utes:seconds),  the  CPU time used by the currently active
       processes (in minutes:seconds), and the name and arguments
       of the current process.
