       The  emergency_disk  command  creates  emergency  recovery
       diskettes customized for  your  system.   These  diskettes
       should  be  created  once  all  your  system  software  is
       installed.  You should store these diskette in a safe  and
       easily  accessible  location  in case an emergency such as
       the following occurs: Your  system  will  not  boot.   The
       UnixWare  system  files are corrupted beyond repair.  Your
       hard disk is damaged and has been reformatted or replaced.
       In such cases you can use the emergency recovery diskettes
       to restore your system.  To do so, insert the first  emer-
       gency  recovery  diskette  and  reboot  your system.  When
       prompted, remove the first  diskette,  insert  the  second
       diskette,  and then press .  Then follow the menu options.

       Two basic set of options are provided:  If  the  operating
       system  software  still  exists  on  your  system, you can
       attempt to repair the damage by using the set of  UnixWare
       commands provided on the emergency diskettes.  In particu-
       lar, you can invoke a UnixWare operating system that  pro-
       vides  the  following commands: and Also, depending on how
       severely your system is damaged, you may be able to  mount
       and  unmount  file  systems  from your hard disk.  In this
       case you can access all the commands on your UnixWare sys-
       tem.   If  you backed up your system using the command and
       later the operating  system  software  is  damaged  beyond
       repair, you can restore your system's data to the state it
       was in at the time  you  backed  it  up  using  the  emer-
       gency_rec command.  If you select this option: The  parti-
       tion on the primary hard disk that  contains  UnixWare  is
       restored.  If the primary hard disk contains a system par-
       tition, then this partition  is  also  restored.   If  the
       /home, /home2, and /var file systems were on the secondary
       hard disk, then these file systems  are  restored  to  the
       secondary  hard disk.  If the -e option was specified when
       running emergency_rec, then the entire primary  hard  disk
       is  restored.  This includes all partitions on the primary
       hard disk and not just the UnixWare and system partitions.
       If  you  created any backups of your system after creating
       the emergency recovery tape(s), you can restore  the  data
       on  these  backups, using the tool you used to back up the
       system.  This must be done after your system is  repaired.
       The  emergency  diskettes are only intended for the system
       where emergency_disk was run.

       Do not confuse the emergency recovery facilities with  the
       backup   and   restore   facilities.    Typically,   after
       installing the system and all add-on software  (for  exam-
       ple,  the  Online  Data  Manager),  the emergency recovery
       diskettes and emergency recovery tape(s) should be created
       using  the emergency_disk and commands.  This media should

                                                                1

emergency_disk(1M)                             emergency_disk(1M)

       then be stored in a safe location in case your  system  is
       corrupted  and a full recovery of the hard disk is needed.
       Assuming your system is not damaged, ARCserveIT from  Com-
       puter Associates should be used on a regular basis to per-
       form all archiving and restoring of user data files.

       identifies a working directory for the emergency_disk com-
       mand.   The  working directory must contain at least 30 MB
       of free space.  The default working directory is /usr.

       identifies the disk drive (``diskette1'' or ``diskette2'')
       containing  the  diskette that should be formatted into an
       emergency recovery diskette for your system.

       To create emergency diskettes using disk drive 2  and  the
       root  file  system  as  the  working  directory,  insert a
       diskette in disk drive 2 and enter:  emergency_disk  -d  /
       diskette2  When  prompted,  remove  the first diskette and
       insert a second diskette.  Then press .

       Attempting to use the emergency diskette to copy  UnixWare
       between  systems is prohibited.  The emergency diskette is
       customized for the system on which it is created  and  may
       have  unpredictable  ramifications if used on another sys-
       tem.

       A temporary log file is created in /tmp/drf_PID.log, where
       PID  is the process ID for the emergency_disk command.  If
       an error is encountered a message is displayed to standard
       error  and  additional information is provided in this log
       file.
