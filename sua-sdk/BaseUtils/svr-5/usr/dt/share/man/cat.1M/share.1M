       The generic share command makes a resource  available  for
       mounting through a remote filesystem of type fstype.

       Only a privileged user can execute this command.

       The  following options are available to the share command:
       Specifies a filesystem type.  When  invoked  with  only  a
       filesystem  type,  share  displays all resources shared by
       the  given  filesystem  to   the   local   system.    spe-
       cific_options as well as the semantics of resourcename are
       specific to the particular distributed filesystem  associ-
       ated  with  the specified filesystem type.  When sharing a
       resource, the -d flag may be used to provide a description
       of  the resource being shared. Note that, if you enter the
       -d option when you share an NFS resource, the  description
       is stored in your sharetab file. However, clients will not
       see the description displayed when they use  the  dfshares
       command  to  list  the  resources  shared  on your system.
       Specifies the pathname of the resource to be shared.  When
       invoked with no arguments, share uses the first filesystem
       type listed in /etc/dfs/fstypes.
