       reads  the  Equipped  Device  Table  (EDT built by the SDI
       drivers and makes any device nodes needed  for  access  to
       the  disk,  tape, and SCSI controllers that are present on
       the system.  Device nodes are always created for the first
       16  slices.   Because  these  device nodes are created for
       each device and are unique to that device  type,  template
       files  are  used to specify the device naming conventions.
       The location of the template files is specified in a  tar-
       get  controller  index file that can be supplied as a com-
       mand-line argument.  By default, anytime a new  device  is
       detected,  a  message  describing the device is printed on
       standard output.  When  more  than  16  slices  are  used,
       device nodes are created for each additional slice in use.
       These device nodes are created from the VTOC  rather  than
       from the template files.

       sdimkdev  keeps  a  record  of  the EDT from invocation to
       invocation in the  /etc/scsi/sdi_edt  file.   If  the  EDT
       obtained  by sdimkdev during execution is identical to the
       one in /etc/scsi/sdi_edt, no action is taken and  sdimkdev
       exits.   If the EDT has changed since the last invocation,
       sdimkdev checks every node for every device in the EDT and
       creates any missing nodes.

       sdimkdev  takes  the following options: Forces sdimkdev to
       run at a time other than from sdimkdev is designed  to  be
       run  from  init; to force its execution at any other time,
       you must use the -f option.  Forces sdimkdev to ignore the
       existing   record   of  this  machine's  configuration  in
       /etc/scsi/sdi_edt and update all SDI device nodes, as if a
       new  device  had  been  added to the system.  Suppress the
       standard output message from sdimkdev indicating that  new
       device nodes were just created for a device.  Use filename
       instead of /etc/scsi/tc.index to determine which  template
       file to use for each device.

       sdimkdev  exits with a return code of zero when it detects
       new devices on the system.  If there are  no  new  devices
       since the last time sdimkdev was executed, it exits with a
       return code of one.  If an error  is  detected,  it  exits
       with a return code other than zero or one.
