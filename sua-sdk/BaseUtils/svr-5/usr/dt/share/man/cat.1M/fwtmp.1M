       fwtmp  reads  from  the  standard  input and writes to the
       standard output, converting binary  records  of  the  type
       found  in  /var/adm/wtmp  to formatted ASCII records.  The
       ASCII version is useful when it is necessary to  edit  bad
       records.

       The  argument -ic is used to denote that input is in ASCII
       form, and output is to be written in binary form.

       wtmpfix examines the standard  input  or  named  files  in
       utmp.h  format,  corrects the time/date stamps to make the
       entries consistent, and writes to the standard output.   A
       -  can  be used in place of files to indicate the standard
       input.  If time/date corrections are not performed,  acct-
       con  will  fault  when  it  encounters certain date-change
       records.

       Each time the date is set, a pair of date  change  records
       are written to /var/adm/wtmp.  The first record is the old
       date denoted by the string ``old time'' placed in the line
       field  and  the  flag OLD_TIME placed in the type field of
       the utmp structure.  The second record specifies  the  new
       date  and  is denoted by the string ``new time'' placed in
       the line field and the flag NEW_TIME placed  in  the  type
       field.  wtmpfix uses these records to synchronize all time
       stamps in the file.

       In addition to correcting time/date stamps,  wtmpfix  will
       check  the  validity  of  the name field to ensure that it
       consists solely of alphanumeric characters or spaces.   If
       it  encounters  a name that is considered invalid, it will
       change the login name to INVALID and write a diagnostic to
       the  standard  error.   In  this  way, wtmpfix reduces the
       chance that acctcon  will  fail  when  processing  connect
       accounting records.
