       generic_options are options supported by the generic mount
       command.   mount  attaches  a  memfs  filesystem  to   the
       filesystem hierarchy at the pathname location mount_point,
       which must already exist.  If mount_point has any contents
       prior  to  the  mount operation, these remain hidden until
       the filesystem is once again unmounted.

       The options are: Specifies  the  memfs  file  system  type
       Specifies  memfs  filesystem  specific options in a comma-
       separated list.  If invalid options are specified, a warn-
       ing  message  is  printed  and  the  invalid  options  are
       ignored.   Multiple  filesystem-specific  options  may  be
       listed in any order, but must be separated by commas.  The
       following options are available: Maximum amount of memory,
       in  bytes,  this  mounted  filesystem  is  allowed to use.
       Default is the maximum value of an unsigned integer.  Max-
       imum  amount  of  memory,  in bytes, all memfs filesystems
       mounted without specifying 'swapmax' are allowed  to  use.
       Default  is  the  maximum  value  of  an unsigned integer.
       Specifies the mode of the root directory  of  the  mounted
       file  system.  Default is 0775.  Mount the filesystem read
       only.

       The swapmax and global_swapmax options are mutually exclu-
       sive  and cannot be specified on one command line (if they
       are, the command fails with EINVAL):  The  swapmax  option
       specifies  memory to be used exclusively for the file sys-
       tem being mounted.  A file  system  mounted  with  swapmax
       ignores  any global_swapmax established on previous mounts
       (for compatibility).  The global_swapmax option  specifies
       memory  to  be  used  as  a pool by all memfs file systems
       mounted without the swapmax option.  A file system mounted
       without swapmax, or without either option, shares the cur-
       rently defined global_swapmax memory  pool.   The  initial
       value  of global_swapmax on initial system installation is
       infinity  (in  order  to  be  compatible  with   currently
       installed systems).  When a memfs mount is initiated spec-
       ifying a new global_swapmax, then either: the  mount  will
       fail  (returning EBUSY) if the new value of global_swapmax
       is less than the total space  occupied  by  all  currently
       mounted  memfs file systems, or the mount will succeed and
       replace the current value of global_swapmax with  the  new
       value.

                                                                1

mount_memfs(1M)                                   mount_memfs(1M)

       The  global_swapmax option allows memfs file systems (like
       /var/tmp and /tmp) to share  the  same  memory  pool,  and
       both:  reduce  the  overall  amount  of memory consumed by
       memfs file systems allow temporary file  systems  to  grow
       and shrink within a greater amount of memory than would be
       available to them individually by using the swapmax option

       If the directory on which a filesystem is to be mounted is
       a symbolic link, the filesystem is mounted on  the  direc-
       tory to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top
       of the symbolic link itself.

       mount_memfs will set  the  root  mode's  owner  and  group
       information to bin, effectively doing a chown and chgrp.

       Mounting  an  memfs filesystem creates an instantiation of
       the filesystem.  Therefore, there is no corresponding mkfs
       command required for the memfs filesystem type.
