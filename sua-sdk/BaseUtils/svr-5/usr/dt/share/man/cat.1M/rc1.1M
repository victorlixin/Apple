       The  shell  script rc1 is run whenever a transition to run
       state 1 is requested either through init 1 or shutdown  -i
       1.

       File  systems  required  for multi-user operations will be
       mounted at the end of rc1.

       When the system comes up from firmware mode into state  1,
       only  the console is active; multi-user (state 2) services
       are unavailable.  When the system is going from state 2 to
       state  1, some services are stopped and some processes are
       killed; otherwise, the system continues  operating  as  it
       did in state 2.

       Note that in this state, logins requiring access to multi-
       user filesystems can be used, but  other  multi-user  ser-
       vices are unavailable.
