       cdsuf  lists  the contents of the System Use Fields (which
       conform to the System Use Sharing Protocol) of the  System
       Use  Area  associated  with  a  File  Section of a file or
       directory.  Information in any  continuation  fields  that
       are present is also displayed.

       The  output  is in the form of a table containing an entry
       for each System Use Field in the System Use Area  recorded
       on  the  CD-ROM.   Each  entry of the table has the fields
       Signature, Length, Version, and Data, as specified in  the
       System Use Sharing Protocol.

       Only  a  privileged  user can execute the command success-
       fully.

       The following options are available:  Specifies  the  File
       Section  number  for  which  the  System Use Area shall be
       read.  The numbering starts with 1.   If  this  option  is
       omitted,  the  last  File Section of that file is assumed.
       Copies all of the System Use Fields of the System Use Area
       from  the  CD-ROM  to  standard  output, in binary format.
       Names the file or directory within the CD-ROM file hierar-

       LC_TIME  determines  the  format  and contents of date and
       time strings.  If LC_TIME is not set in the environment or
       is  set  to the empty string, the value of LANG is used as
       the default.  If LANG is not set or is set  to  the  empty
       string,  the  corresponding value from the implementation-
       specific default locale is used.  If LC_TIME or LANG  con-
       tain an invalid setting, the utility behaves as if none of
       the variables are defined.
