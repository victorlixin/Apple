       System activity  data  can  be  accessed  at  the  special
       request  of  a  user  (see and automatically, on a routine
       basis, as described here.  The operating  system  contains
       several  counters  that  are incremented as various system
       actions occur.  These include counters  for  CPU  utiliza-
       tion, buffer usage, disk and tape I/O activity, TTY device
       activity, switching and system-call activity, file-access,
       queue  activity, inter-process communications, and paging.

       sadc and two shell procedures, sa1 and sa2,  are  used  to
       sample, save, and process this data.

       sadc,  the  data  collector,  samples system data n times,
       with an interval of t seconds between samples, and  writes
       in binary format to ofile or to standard output.  The sam-
       pling interval t should be greater than 5 seconds;  other-
       wise,  the  activity of sadc itself may affect the sample.
       If t and n are omitted, a special record is written.  This
       facility  is  used  at system boot time, when booting to a
       multiuser state, to mark the time at  which  the  counters
       restart from zero.  For example, the /etc/init.d/perf file
       writes the restart mark to the daily data by  the  command
       entry:    su    sys    -c    "$TFADMIN    /usr/lib/sa/sadc
       /var/adm/sa/sa`date +%d`" The shell script sa1, a  variant
       of  sadc,  is used to collect and store data in the binary
       file /var/adm/sa/sadd, where dd is the current  day.   The
       arguments  t  and n cause records to be written n times at
       an interval of t seconds, or once if omitted.  The follow-
       ing   entries   in   /var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys  produce
       records every 20 minutes during working hours  and  hourly
       otherwise: 0 * * * 0-6 $TFADMIN /usr/lib/sa/sa1 20,40 8-17
       * * 1-5 $TFADMIN /usr/lib/sa/sa1 See for details.

       The shell script sa2, a variant of  sar,  writes  a  daily
       report  in  the  file  /var/adm/sa/sardd.  The options are
       explained     in     The      following      entry      in
       /var/spool/cron/crontabs/sys  reports important activities
       hourly during the working day:  5  18  *  *  1-5  $TFADMIN
