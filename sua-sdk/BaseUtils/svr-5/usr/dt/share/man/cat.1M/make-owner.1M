       The  make-owner  command adds, removes, or transfers owner
       authorizations and adds and removes entries from  the  TFM
       database.  System owners are usually defined via the admin
       Account Manager.

       It also adds the owner to the dtadmin supplementary group.

       add  newowner  to  the database transfer owner permissions
       from  oldowner  to  newowner  removes  oldowner  from  the
       database

       Only  an  owner is allowed to add or remove user accounts,
       grant privileges to other user accounts,  and  backup  and
       restore all files on the system.

       To  assign  the privileges necessary to execute admin man-
       agers, make-owner checks  /usr/lib/scoadmin/account/Owner-
       Privs  and  executes any file it finds.  The files in this
       directory must contain the necessary code to assign privi-
       leges.   In  general there will be one line of code, as in
       this example:  $ADMIN  -a  chmod:/bin/chmod:allprivs  $OWN
       >/dev/null  2>&1  This is run for each command being added
       to the user's privilege set.   The  environment  variables
       OWN and ADMIN have been exported and should be used by the
       script.  However, the contents of the OwnerPrivs  file  is
       not  restricted  to  the above.  For example, roles can be
       assigned as in  this  example:  LANG=C  /bin/adminuser  -o
       $NEWROLES $1
