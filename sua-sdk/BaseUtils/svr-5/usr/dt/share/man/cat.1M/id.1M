       id  displays information on the calling process's user and
       group IDs.  If user is specified, then information on  the
       user login is displayed instead.

       The  information displayed is the user ID and name and the
       group ID and name.  If the real and effective user IDs  do
       not  match,  both  are printed.  The same is true for real
       and effective group IDs. If the user belongs to more  than
       one group, the extra groups are also displayed.

       The  output format is a sequence of equality statements of
       the form id-title=numeric-id(name)  each  separated  by  a
       singlespace.  The numeric-id is the numeric representation
       of the group or user, real or effective ID.  The  name  is
       the  symbolic representation of this ID (the login name of
       the user, for example).  In the C locale, the id-title  is
       one of the following strings.
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       id-title                           description
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       uid                                user ID
       gid                                group ID
       euid                               effective user ID
       egid                               effective group ID
       groups                             supplementary group IDs
       The  equality  statements are presented in the order given
       in the table, with each statement present according to the
       conditions explained in the first paragraph.  However, the
       groups statement, which is always written last, if at all,
       is  slightly  different  because  each extra supplementary
       group after the first  does  not  have  its  own  equality
       statement  but  adds  ,numeric-id(name)  to the end of the
       output line.

   OOppttiioonnss
       This option does nothing.  It is for backward  compatibil-
       ity  only,  and should not be used.  Display all different
       (numeric) group IDs (real, effective, and  supplementary),
       each  separated  by  a  space.  Display only the effective
       (numeric) group ID.   Display  the  name  instead  of  the
       numeric  ID  (when used with -G, -g, or %-u).  Display the
       real ID instead of the effective ID (when used with -g  or
       -u).  Display only the effective (numeric) user ID.
