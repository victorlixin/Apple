       mailstats prints out statistics on mailer  usage  as  col-
       lected by the program.  sendmail collects these statistics
       into the file specified by the S configuration  option  of
       sendmail,  but collects these statistics only if this file
       exists.  This file must be created manually by the  system
       administrator.

       By  default,  mailstats  reads the file specified by the S
       configuration option of sendmail  for  the  statistics  to
       display.   The -f option allows you to specify a different
       source file.

       The default sendmail configuration  file  where  mailstats
       looks for the S configuration option setting is /etc/send-
       mail.cf.  The -C option allows you to specify a  different
       configuration file.

       The first row of mailstats' output is the date and time at
       which the collection of the  displayed  statistics  began.
       Beneath  the date and time row is a table in the following
       format: M  msgsfr  bytes_from  msgsto   bytes_to   msgsrej
       msgsdis   Mailer  The  table will contain one row for each
       mailer that is specified  in  the  sendmail  configuration
       file  for  which  messages have been sent or received.  No
       numbers are printed if no messages were sent (or received)
       for  any mailer.  The table columns contain the following:
       shows the mailer number shows the number of mail  messages
       received by sendmail from this mailer shows the collective
       size, in 1024 byte units, of the messages counted  in  the
       previous  column shows the number of mail messages sent by
       sendmail using this mailer shows the collective  size,  in
       1024  byte  units, of the messages counted in the previous
       column shows the number of mail messages rejected by send-
       mail  using  this mailer shows the number of mail messages
       discarded by sendmail using this mailer shows the name  of
       the mailer. The mailer name can be suppressed using the -o
       option.      An     entry     can     be     added      to
       /usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root  to reinitialize the statis-
       tics once every day/night. Copy /dev/null into the statis-
       tics file (/etc/mail/sendmail.st) or otherwise truncate it
       to reset the counters.
