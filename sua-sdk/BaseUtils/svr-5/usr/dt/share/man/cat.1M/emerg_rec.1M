       The   emergency_rec  command  creates  emergency  recovery
       tape(s).  By default, emergency_rec backs up  the   parti-
       tion  and  the system partition, if it exists, on the pri-
       mary hard disk.  If there is a  partition on the secondary
       disk,  emergency_rec  will  back up the /usr, /home and/or
       /home2 filesystems from the secondary disk, if they exist.

       If  the -e option is specified, the entire primary disk is
       backed up (see Options).

       emergency_rec must be executed in single user mode.

       If multiple tape(s) are required to back  up  the  system,
       when  one  tape  is  filled  with data you are prompted to
       insert the next tape.  For example, emergency_rec can back
       up a 300MB hard disk onto three 120MB cartridge tapes.

       To  restore  systems backed up with emergency_rec, use the
       diskettes created by the command.

       emergency_rec is designed to back up the system in case an
       emergency  occurs  (your  hard disk is damaged and must be
       restored to an earlier state).  In such circumstances,  it
       is  quicker  and  easier  to  restore your system with the
       emergency  recovery  diskettes  and   emergency   recovery
       tape(s) instead of installing your system again.

       emergency_rec backs up all files on each filesystem saved.
       Typically, emergency_rec is run once after all the  system
       software  is  installed  (if  you later install additional
       system software, run emergency_rec again); ARCserveIT from
       Computer  Associates  commands  are then used on a regular
       basis to back up and restore user data.

       Some transfer block sizes can cause restore failures  with
       on  some  filesystems.  To prevent this, specify the block
       size of the data transfer using the -o or -s flags.

       emergency_rec queries the /usr/lib/drf/tapeconfig file for
       the physical block size to use for a specific tape device.
       If no entry is found, it uses the default safe mode of 512
       bytes.  Physical  block  sizes will vary, depending on the
       tape drive/HBA combination used. You should  consult  your
       tape  drive  manufacturer  to  find the maximum block size
       allowed.

                                                                1

       Please note that both the floppies and  the  emergency_rec
       tapes will need to be recreated following a change to this
       file.

       Note also that you must ensure that the same block size is
       used when restoring a filesystem.

       The     format     of     the    tapeconfig    file    is:
       tapedevice1    blocksize1  tapedevice2    blocksize2   The
       tape device field is the logical device name. This must be
       resolvable into an actual device. See the alias  attribute
       on The blocksize field is the block size in bytes.

       This  specifies  that dd uses a block size of 64KB for all
       filesystems.  Back up the entire primary hard disk includ-
       ing any non- partitions.  The secondary disk is not backed
       up at all.  The optional tapesize argument allows  you  to
       split  the  disk image across multiple tapes if the tape's
       capacity is smaller than the disk  size.   This  specifies
       that  dd  uses  a block size of 1024 bytes for /stand, and
       32KB for everything else.  This specifies that dd  uses  a
       block  size  of  512  bytes  for writing and restoring all
       filesystems.  If no flags are specified, the backup mecha-

       with a  suffix  of  k,  M  or  G  to  indicate  kilobytes,
       megabytes or gigabytes.

       If  tapesize  is  not  specified,  the  tape must be large
       enough to back up your primary hard  disk.   For  example,
       you  could  use a 4GB DAT tape provided that your system's
       primary hard disk were no larger than this.

       Attempting  to  use  the  emergency_rec  command  to  copy
       UnixWare  from one system to another system is prohibited.
       The emergency recovery tape is customized for  the  system
       on  which it is created and may have unpredictable ramifi-
       cations if used on another system.
