       Only a privileged user can change the exclusive binding of
       processes using the pexbind command.

       The processor_id is an integer that uniquely identifies  a
       processor; the pid is the process ID.

       All LWPs within a specified process are bound to a proces-
       sor.  LWPs that are exclusively bound to a processor  will
       execute  only  on that processor.  However, an exclusively
       bound LWP will execute briefly on another processor if the
       LWP requires a resource that only that other processor can
       provide.  In general,  the  processor  will  execute  only
       those LWPs that are exclusively bound to it.  However, the
       processor can briefly execute other LWPs in the system  if
       it must provide a resource to the other LWPs that no other
       processor can provide.

       If there are already LWPs bound to the  specified  proces-
       sor,  either  exclusively or non-exclusively, pexbind will
       fail.  Note, to exclusively bind several LWPs to a proces-
       sor,  all  LWPs  must  be  specified  in one invocation of
       pexbind.

       If an LWP specified by pid is already exclusively bound to
       a different processor, the exclusive binding for that pro-
       cess will be changed to the specified processor.  If, how-
       ever,  an  LWP  specified  by pid is bound non-exclusively
       (for example, with pbind) the previous non-exclusive bind-
       ing  will  remain  in effect for that process (the pexbind
       call will have no effect on that process).

       The options are: specify an exclusive processor bind oper-
       ation remove any previous exclusive binding for the speci-
       fied process(es).  display exclusive  binding  information
       for  the  specified  processes.  If no pids are specified,
       pexbind displays exclusive  binding  information  for  the
       entire system.

       The  following  conditions will result in abnormal program
       termination: user does not have appropriate privilege pro-
       cessor_id specified is invalid specified processor has one
       or more LWPs exclusively bound to it.

       This command may not  be  supported  in  future  releases.
       Applications  and  shell  scripts should not depend on the
       format of the output  displayed  by  pexbind  -q;  it  may

                                                                1
