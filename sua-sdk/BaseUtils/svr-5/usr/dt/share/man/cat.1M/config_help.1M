       The config_help script examines the documentation  distri-
       bution  files  in  the given topicID directories or, if no
       topicID is specified, on the entire set of topicID  direc-
       tories,  and then constructs the necessary files that con-
       nect the documentation into  the  &scohelp;  system.   See
       also

       If  the  -L  option is specified, the processes are run on
       the given language (LANG); otherwise all language versions
       are  processed.   For  example, the following command runs
       config_help on all the topicID directories  under  the  es
       (Spanish  language) directory: config_help -L es If the -n
       option is specified, all processing takes place except the
       final  full-text indexing step.  The bulk insert files are
       generated and placed  in  /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/_SearchIn-
       dex/Insert,  ready to be indexed, but the bulk insert pro-
       cess is not performed.  This permits several documentation
       packages  to  be  processed  before running the (sometimes
       lengthy) indexing process on the whole  set.   If  the  -n
       option  is  not specified, config_help runs automatically.
       The installation script should always run the last call to
       config_help without the -n option so the new documentation
       files get indexed.

       Run config_help whenever new  documentation  packages  are
       installed,  updated, or removed.  Run after config_help to
       process the view stanza files and update the appropriate

       config_help performs  the  following  actions:  Regenerate
       tables  of  contents,  if appropriate.  Generate full-text
       search indexes.   Add  the  print  sequence  data  to  the
       database.

       For each topicID, config_help creates the following files:
       topicID/topicID.titles topicID/CONTENTS.html  (unless  the
       TOCtype   field  in  the  .book  file  is  set  to  fixed)
       _SearchIndex/Insert/topicID.vbi When config_search is run,
       the  topicID.vbi  file  moves to the _SearchIndex/Indexed/
       directory.

       When a  documentation  package  is  removed,  the  removal
       script  should  delete  only  the files that it installed.
       (The ODSSI-generated .titles and CONTENTS.html files  pre-
       vent  the  removal  script  from  removing the directory.)
       After the removal script removes the files  it  installed,
       the  script  should  run  config_help on the topicID; con-
       fig_help detects that there are no other files and removes
       the  .titles and CONTENTS.html files, as well as the topi-
       cID directory.  config_help  also  moves  the  topicID.vbi

                                                                1

config_help(1M)                                   config_help(1M)

       file  to  the  _SearchIndex/Delete directory and runs con-
       fig_search (if the -n option is not specified)  to  remove
       the  index entries from the search databases.  The removal
       script should also run config_views to remove the  topicID
       from the views.

       The   configuration   works   from  whatever  material  is
       installed when the script is run.  As such, it  works  for
       new  installation,  updates,  and removals.  The processes
       are repeatable, so processing material  that  has  already
       been  processed does not result in error.  The scripts can
       be run again on the same installed  material  and  produce
       the same results.
