       generic_options are options supported by the generic mount
       command.

       mount notifies the system that special, an s5  block  spe-
       cial  device,  is  available to users from the mount_point
       which must exist before mount is called;  it  becomes  the
       name of the root of the newly mounted special.

       The  options  are:  Specify the s5 FSType. If -F s5 is not
       specified heuristics similiar to those used by are used to
       determine  the  file  system  type.  This command executes
       faster if it is not required  to  autodetect  file  system
       types. If possible, specify the -F s5.  Mount the filesys-
       tem read-only.  Specify the s5 file-specific options in  a
       comma-separated   list.    The   available   options  are:
       Read/write or read-only. Default is rw.  Setuid is honored
       or ignored on execution.  Default is suid.

       Note  that  a  mount  of  an unprotected medium (such as a
       floppy disk) introduces possible  security  risks.   While
       the  use  of nosuid protects against some risks, it is not
       completely effective.  The best defense against such secu-
       rity  risks  is to avoid mounting unprotected media.  Used
       in conjunction with rw. A filesystem mounted read-only can
       be  remounted  read-write.  Fails if the filesystem is not
       currently mounted or if  the  filesystem  is  mounted  rw.
       Option is in force only when specified.
