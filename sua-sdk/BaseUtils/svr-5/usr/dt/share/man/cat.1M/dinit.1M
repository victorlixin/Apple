       This file is executed via an entry in /etc/inittab.  dinit
       is responsible for completing portions of  initializations
       (traditionally  performed by rc2), for multi-user states 2
       and 3 that can be delayed until after the login  processes
       have  been  created.   The  purpose  of this command is to
       improve the performance of system  startup  to  multi-user
       states.

       The  actions  performed by dinit are found in files in the
       directory /etc/dinit.d.  Files in /etc/dinit.d must  begin
       with  an S or a K followed by a number and the rest of the
       filename.  Files beginning with S are  executed  with  the
       start  option;  files  beginning with K, are executed with
       the stop option.  Files beginning  with  other  characters
       are  ignored.   These files are executed by /usr/bin/sh in
       ASCII sort-sequence order.

       When functions are added that need to be initialized  when
       the  system  goes multi-user, but that do not need to com-
       plete before the user logs into the system, an appropriate
       file should be added in /etc/dinit.d.

       Examples  of  functions performed by the dinit command and
       its associated /etc/dinit.d files  include:  starting  the
       connection  server  starting printer services starting the
       cron daemon by executing  /usr/sbin/cron  Other  functions
       can  be  added,  as  required,  to support the addition of
       hardware and software features.
