       ipop2d  and  ipop3d are servers which support the POP2 and
       POP3 remote mail access protocols respectively.  They  can
       also  be used by POP2 and POP3 clients to access mailboxes
       on IMAP servers by specifying a login  user  name  in  the
       form host:user, for example SERVER.WASHINGTON.EDU:SMITH.

       popd  is  normally invoked by the Internet server (see the
       manual page) for requests to connect to the  POP  port  as
       indicated by the /etc/services file (see the manual page).

       The POP2 and POP3 protocols are intrinsically less  flexi-
       ble  than  IMAP  (see the manual page) and do not maintain
       ``read'' vs ``unread'' states on the server. As a  result,
       most  POP-based  software  transfers all the mail from the
       server to the client and deletes it from the server.  This
       necessarily  locks  the  user  into  using  only  a single
       client.

       POP3 does not allow you to  specify  an  alternate  folder
       from the user's default.
