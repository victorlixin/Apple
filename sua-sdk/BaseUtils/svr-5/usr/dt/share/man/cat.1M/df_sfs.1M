       generic_options are options supported by  the  generic  df
       command.

       df  displays the amount of disk space occupied by sfs file
       systems, the amount of used and available space,  and  how
       much of the file system's total capacity has been used.

       Specifies  the  sfs-FSType.   File  system  types  can  be
       autodetected so in principle  this  option  is  no  longer
       required.  However,  df executes faster if the file system
       type is specifed rather than having  to  be  autodetected.
       Specify  sfs  file system specific options.  The available
       option is: Report the number of used and free inodes.  May
       not be used with generic_options.
