       login,  user  ID  number,  /etc/passwd account field value
       (user name or other information), primary group name, pri-
       mary  group  id, multiple group names, multiple group ids,
       home directory,  login  shell,  and  four  password  aging
       parameters.   The  default  information  is the following:
       login id, user id, primary group name,  primary  group  ID
       and  the  account field value from /etc/passwd.  Output is
       sorted by user id, displaying system  logins  followed  by
       user  logins.   Selects  logins with duplicate uids.  Dis-

       each  displayed on a separate line.  The password informa-
       tion consists of password status (PS  for  passworded,  NP
       for  no  password or LK for locked), the date the password
       was last changed, the  number  of  days  required  between
       changes,  the  number  of  days allowed before a change is
       required, and the  number  of  days  that  the  user  will
       receive  a  password expiration warning message (when log-
       ging on) before the password expires.  Adds  two  password
       expiration  fields  to  the  display.  The fields show how
       many days a password can remain unused before it automati-
       cally becomes inactive and the date that the password will
       expire.  Print's the user's audit event mask.  This option

       to more than one of the selected groups.
