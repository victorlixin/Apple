       The fsba command determines the  disk  space  required  to
       store  the data from an existing s5 filesystem in a new s5
       filesystem with the specified logical  block  size.   Each
       file-system listed on the command line refers to an exist-
       ing filesystem and should be specified by device name (for
       example,  /dev/rdsk/*,  where  the  value  of * is machine
       dependent).

       The target_block_size specifies the logical block size  in
       bytes of the new filesystem.  Valid target block sizes for
       the s5 filesystem are 512, 1024, and  2048.   The  default
       target block size for the s5 filesystem is 2048.

       The   fsba  command  prints  information  about  how  many
       512-byte disk sectors are allocated to store the  data  in
       the  old  (existing)  filesystem  and  how  many  would be
       required to store the same data in a new  filesystem  with
       the specified logical block size.  It also prints the num-
       ber  of  allocated  and  free  i-nodes  for  the  existing
       filesystem.

       If  the number of free sectors listed for the new filesys-
       tem is negative, the data will not fit in the new filesys-
       tem unless the new file system is larger than the existing
       filesystem.  The new filesystem must be made at  least  as
       large as the number of sectors listed by fsba as allocated
       for the new filesystem.   The  maximum  size  of  the  new
       filesystem  is  limited  by the size of the disk partition
       used for the new filesystem.

       Note that it is possible to  specify  a  target_block_size
       that  is smaller than the logical block size of the exist-
       ing filesystem.  In this case  the  new  filesystem  would
       require fewer sectors to store the data.
