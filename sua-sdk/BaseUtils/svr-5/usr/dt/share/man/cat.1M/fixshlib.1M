        applications  installed with the custom command [see will
       automatically have references to libnsl changed to  refer-
       ence   a    System  V/386  Release  3.2-compatible  libnsl
       (/shlib/libNSL_s).  However, you may need to run  fixshlib
       on  any   System V/386 Release 3.2 application that is not
       installed using the custom command.  The fixshlib  command
       will alter the executable to use the
         System V/386 Release 3.2-compatible libnsl.

       When  executing  the  command, file is the pathname of the
       executable to be modified.

       If fixshlib is run on  a  non-SCO   executable,  the  exe-
       cutable  will no longer execute properly and will be unus-
       able.  Therefore, as a precaution, we recommend  that  you
       make  a copy of each executable before you run fixshlib on
       it.  If your executable fails because fixshlib should  not
       have  been run on it, you can restore it from the copy you
       made.  Otherwise, you will have to re-install the applica-
       tion that contained the executable.
