       secdefs  compares  the current settings of the system-wide
       security defaults with  the  security  levels  defined  in
       /etc/security/seclevel  (high,  improved, traditional, and
       low).  secdefs reports the name of  the  closest  security
       level that has the least number of differences.

       secdefs  takes  the  following options and arguments: Dis-
       plays a table of the  actual  differences  as  well  as  a
       count.   The  three columns of the table display: the name
       of a default file in /etc/default a keyword entry  in  the
       default  file the currently assigned value of the keyword,
       and the value defined by the security level

       Displays comparisons for each security  level  defined  in
       /etc/security/seclevel,  in  order of increasing number of
       differences.  Reports differences for each  of  the  named
       levels.

       secdefs  examines  only  the etc_def file in the directory
       /etc/security/seclevel/level.  It does not compare  values
       set  in  the  script  file  against  the  current security
       defaults.
