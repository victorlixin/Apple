       quot displays the number of blocks  (1024  bytes)  in  the
       named filesystem currently owned by each user.  There is a
       limit of 2048 blocks.  Files larger than this are  counted
       as  a  2048 block file, but the total blocks count remains
       correct.

       quot is supported on the ufs and vxfs FStypes.

       The options are: Specify the FSType on which  to  operate.
       If -F FSType is not specified it is determined by matching
       the inputfs device with an entry in /etc/vfstab.  If  this
       fails,  heuristics  similiar  to those used by are used to
       determine the file system type.  If the  FSType  is  known
       beforehand,  use  the  -F  option.  This  command executes
       faster if it is not required  to  autodetect  file  system
       types.  Echo the complete command line, but do not execute
       the command.  The command line is generated by  using  the
       options  and  arguments provided by the user and adding to
       them information derived from  /etc/vfstab.   This  option
       should  be  used  to verify and validate the command line.
       Specify FSType-specific options.
