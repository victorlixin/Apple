       The generic dfmounts command  shows  the  local  resources
       currently   mounted   by  clients  through  a  distributed
       filesystem fstype along with a list of clients  that  have
       the resource mounted.

       The output of dfmounts consists of an optional header line
       (suppressed with the -h flag) followed by a list of  lines
       containing whitespace-separated fields.

       For  each  resource,  the fields are: resource server path
       clients where The meaning of resource  is  dependent  upon
       the  distributed  file  system  type  that  is being used.
       Specifies the system from which the resource was  mounted.
       Specifies the pathname that was given to the command.  The
       format of clients is dependent upon the  distributed  file
       system type that is being used.  A field may be NULL. Each
       NULL field is indicated by a hyphen (-) unless the remain-
       der of the fields on the line are also NULL. In this case,
       it is blank.

       The following options are available to the  dfmounts  com-
       mand:  Specifies  the  filesystem  type. If this option is
       omitted, dfmounts is executed  for  each  configured  dis-
       tributed  filesystem  type.  Suppresses the header line in
       dfmounts output.  Depend upon the  distributed  filesystem
       (fstype)  being  used.  For a list of specific_options and
       for details of the availability and semantics of  restric-
       tion,  refer  to  the documentation on the filesystem type
       being used.

       specific_options and restriction should be  used  in  con-
       junction with the -F option.  If dfmounts is entered with-
       out arguments, all resources currently shared on the local
       system, along with resources that are available for mount-
       ing, are displayed, regardless of filesystem type.
