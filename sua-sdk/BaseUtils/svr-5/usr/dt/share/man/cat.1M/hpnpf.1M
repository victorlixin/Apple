       hpnpf reads each file in sequence sending it to a  network
       peripheral  over  a  TCP  connection. It writes any output
       from the network peripheral to  the  standard  output.  As
       with  hpnpf reads from the standard input if no input file
       is given or if the argument - is encountered. This enables
       you to combine the standard input with other files.

       If  hpnpf  fails  to  make  a connection to peripheral, it
       retries the connection until  it  is  successful.  The  -R
       option prevents it retrying.

       hpnpf  can  operate  as an output filter, an input filter,
       and as both an output and input filter (``relay'' mode).

       Using hpnpf as a  relay  process  (using  the  -r  option)
       allows  the banner page and all print job files to be sent
       to the network peripheral over a single connection.

       hpnpf accepts a banner page from the standard input, sends
       it to the network peripheral, and then relays further data
       sent by the input filters.  The  file  .port,  written  by
       hpnpf  in the current directory, indicates the control and
       data ports that the input filters use to connect to hpnpf.
       After  the  input  filter completes a file, it waits for a
       single byte response from hpnpf on  the  control  port.  A
       response of zero indicates that hpnpf transmitted the data
       successfully  and  its  buffers  are  empty.  A   non-zero
       response indicates an error.

       hpnpf accepts the following options: Create a control line
       connection. This option is only  used  when  /etc/printcap
       specifies  hpnpf as an input filter to pass data through a
       relay process on the same  host.   Write  verbose  logging
       information  to logfile. The logging messages are detailed
       messages about what hpnpf is doing. Included in  the  mes-
       sages  are how many bytes are read and written to the net-
       work connection.  hpnpf performs no logging  if  you  omit
       this  option.   Send  the  PCL  escape  sequence (ESC&k2G)
       before the files. This sets the end-of-line  character  to
       be  newline  (ASCII  LF)  instead of carriage-return/line-
       feed.  Translate newline (ASCII  LF)  characters  to  car-
       riage-return/line-feed  character  pairs  for data sent to
       the network peripheral. Do not use this option for  binary
       transfers.  Connect to port on the network peripheral. The
       default is port 9100.  Operate in relay mode. This  option
       is only used when /etc/printcap specifies hpnpf as an out-
       put filter together with a separate  input  filter.  hpnpf

                                                                1

       ignores  any files listed on the command line when operat-
       ing in relay mode.  Do not retry if the  first  connection
       attempt  fails.  This option allows the retry interval and
       number of retries before giving up to be controlled exter-
       nally  to  hpnpf.   Verbose  mode. Display messages to the
       standard error when the connection is initiated  and  when
       it succeeds. Print a number sign (#) to the standard error
       output for each 1024 bytes transferred.  Send the file  to
       peripheral;  this  may  be  a  host name or dotted decimal
       Internet address.

       hpnpf returns 0 if all the files are sent successfully. It
       returns a non-zero value if a failure was detected.
