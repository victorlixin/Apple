       fuser outputs the process IDs of the  processes  that  are
       using  the  files  or  remote resources specified as argu-
       ments.  Each process ID is followed by one of these letter
       codes,  which  identify how the process is using the file:
       as its current directory.  as its  root  directory,  which
       was  set up by the command.  as an open file.  as its text
       file.  For block special devices with mounted filesystems,
       processes  using  any file on that device are listed.  For
       remote resource names, processes using any file associated
       with  that  remote  resource  are reported.  For all other
       types of  files  (text  files,  executables,  directories,
       devices, and so on) only the processes using that file are
       reported.

       The following options may be used with fuser: may be  used
       with  files  that are mount points for file systems.  With
       that option the report is for use of the mount  point  and
       any  files  within  that mounted filesystem.  when this is
       used, the report is only for the named file, not for files
       within  a  mounted  filesystem.   the  user login name, in
       parentheses, also follows the  process  ID.   the  SIGKILL
       signal  is sent to each process.  Since this option spawns
       kills for each process, the kill messages may not show  up
       immediately (see If more than one group of files are spec-
       ified, the options may be respecified for each  additional
       group of files.  A lone dash cancels the options currently
       in force.

       The process IDs are printed as a single line on the  stan-
       dard  output,  separated  by  spaces and terminated with a
       single new line.  All other output is written on  standard
       error.

       Any  user with permission to read /dev/kmem can use fuser.
       Only a privileged user can terminate another  user's  pro-
       cess.

       If an RFS resource from a pre System V Release 4 server is
       mounted, fuser  can  only  report  on  use  of  the  whole
       filesystem,  not  on individual files within it.  This RFS
       interface is no longer supported.

       Because fuser works with a snapshot of the  system  image,
       it  may miss processes that begin using a file while fuser
       is running.  Also, processes reported as using a file  may
       have stopped using it while fuser was running.  These fac-
       tors should discourage the use of the -k option.

       fuser does not report all possible usages of a  file  (for
       example, a mapped file).
