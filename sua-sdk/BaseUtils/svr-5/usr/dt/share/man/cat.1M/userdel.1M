       The userdel command deletes a user's login definition from
       the system.  It removes the definition  of  the  specified
       login  and makes the appropriate login-related system file
       and filesystem changes.  The command also stores the  user
       identification   number   (UID)   being   deleted  in  the
       /etc/security/ia/ageduid file, so  the  UID  will  not  be
       reused  until  a period of time has passed.  This practice
       of keeping a UID out of use is called UID aging.

       The following options are  available:  Remove  the  user's
       home  directory  from  the  system.   This  directory must
       exist.  The files and directories under the home directory
       will  no  longer be accessible following successful execu-
       tion of the command.  Note that the user's home  directory
       may  not  be removed if the pathname of the home directory
       is administered through the  Network  Information  Service
       (NIS)  and  NIS  is unavailable at the time you delete the
       user's entry.  Specify a value for the number of months to
       age  the UID.  Specify -1 to indicate the UID should never
       be reused.  Specify 0 to indicate the UID  may  be  reused
       immediately.   If  the -n option is not specified, the UID
       will be aged for a default number of months before it will
       be  reused.   A string of printable characters that speci-
       fies an existing login on the system.  It may not  contain
       a colon (:) or a newline (\n).

       If  login is being administered by the Network Information
       Service (NIS), login will only be removed from  the  local
       system, not the NIS database.

       Whenever  you  use  the userdel command to delete a user's
       login, you should execute adminuser -d login_name to avoid
       creating  any  security holes; otherwise security breaches
       will be introduced when you remove logins  for  users  who
       have  been  added  to  the  TFM database.  Use the desktop
       metaphor to remove users who have been added  through  the
       metaphor.

       Not  all  users  have privileges but desktop users usually
       do.  If a user whose login is being removed has no  privi-
       leges  and  you execute adminuser -d, you'll simply get an
       error    message:    UX:adminuser:ERROR:Undefined     user
       login_name

       The userdel command exits with a return  code  of  0  upon
       successful  completion.   In case of errors, the following
       messages may be displayed: Invalid  command  syntax.   The
       login  to  be  removed  does  not  exist.  The login to be
       removed is in use.  Cannot update the /etc/group file  but
       the  login  is  removed from the /etc/passwd file.  Cannot
       remove or otherwise modify the home directory.
