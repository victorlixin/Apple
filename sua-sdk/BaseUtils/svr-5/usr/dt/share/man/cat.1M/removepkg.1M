       The command removepkg removes the USL-style
        system  software  package  specified  by  pkg, or a user-
       selected package if no argument is specified.

       If an argument is specified, removepkg searches  the  list
       of  previously  installed  packages  and removes the first
       name which matches pkg.  If no name is matched,  an  error
       message is issued.

       If  no  argument is specified, removepkg queries the user,
       via a menu, about which package is to be removed.

       You must be logged in as root to remove some packages.
