       classconf  manages  the  registration and configuration of
       admin classes as  implemented  by  object  service  agents
       (OSA)s.   A  class may be added and deleted.  All the cur-
       rently registered classes may  be  listed.   classconf  is
       typically used by installation scripts for software compo-
       nents that provide classes via OSAs but may  be  used  for
       system administration purposes.
