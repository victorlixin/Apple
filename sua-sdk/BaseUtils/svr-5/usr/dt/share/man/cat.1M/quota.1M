       quota displays users' disk usage and limits.  Only a priv-
       ileged user may use the optional username argument to view
       the limits of other users.  quota is supported on the  ufs
       and vxfs FStypes.

       quota without options displays only warnings about mounted
       filesystems where quotas are turned on and usage  is  over
       quota.   Remotely  mounted  filesystems  which do not have
       quotas turned on are ignored.

       username can be numeric, corresponding to  the  UID  of  a
       user.

       Specify  the  FSType on which to operate.  If -F FSType is
       not specified it is determined  by  matching  the  inputfs
       device  with  an  entry  in  /etc/vfstab.   If this fails,
       heuristics similiar to those used by are used to determine
       the  file system type.  If the FSType is known beforehand,
       use the -F option. This command executes faster if  it  is
       not  required  to  autodetect file system types.  Echo the
       complete command line, but do  not  execute  the  command.
       The  command  line  is  generated by using the options and
       arguments provided by the user and adding to them informa-
       tion derived from /etc/vfstab.  This option should be used
       to verify and validate the command line.  Specify  FSType-
       specific options.
