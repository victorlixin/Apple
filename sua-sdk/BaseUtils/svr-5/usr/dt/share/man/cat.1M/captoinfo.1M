       captoinfo  looks  in  file  for termcap descriptions.  For
       each one found, an equivalent description  is  written  to
       standard   output,  along  with  any  comments  found.   A
       description which is  expressed  as  relative  to  another
       description  (as  specified in the termcap tc= field) will
       be reduced to the minimum superset before being output.

       If no file is given, then the environment variable TERMCAP
       is  used  for the filename or entry.  If TERMCAP is a full
       pathname to a file, only the terminal whose name is speci-
       fied  in  the  environment variable TERM is extracted from
       that file.  If the environment  variable  TERMCAP  is  not
       set,  then the file /usr/share/lib/termcap is read.  print
       out tracing information on standard error as  the  program
       runs.   Specifying  additional  -v options will cause more
       detailed information to be printed.  print out the version
       of  the  program in use on standard error and exit.  cause
       the fields to print out one to  a  line.   Otherwise,  the
       fields  will  be  printed  several  to a line to a maximum
       width of 60 characters.  change the output to width  char-
       acters.

       This command produces output in the enhanced terminfo for-
       mat specified by The Single UNIX Specification, Version 2;

       captoinfo should be used to  convert  termcap  entries  to
       terminfo  entries  because the termcap database (from ear-
       lier versions of  System V) may not be supplied in  future
       releases.
