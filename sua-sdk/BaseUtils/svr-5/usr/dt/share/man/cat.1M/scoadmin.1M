       scoadmin is a command line utility that invokes admin man-
       agement  applications or configures their placement in the
       admin hierarchy.  When invoked without arguments, scoadmin
       invokes  the  admin launcher, a menu interface that allows
       managers to be selected from a list.  scoadmin can also be
       used to invoke individual admin applications.  (The behav-
       ior of scoadmin is identical in the character and  graphi-
       cal environments.)  admin consists of a management hierar-
       chy with applications (objects) grouped in  folders.   The
       structure,  format  and  content of the admin framework is
       described in

       scoadmin is also used to add, update, or  remove  applica-
       tions on the admin hierarchy.

       The  following  options are supported: forces an update of
       the admin  /usr/lib/scoadmin/admin.ts/.index  file,  which
       contains  a sorted list of applications in the admin hier-
       archy.  This file is used to speed up the invocation  pro-
       cess.  copies a locale-specific title file into the scoad-
       min  hierarchy.  When  the  system  LANG  environment   is
       changed,  scoadmin  uses  the appropriate title file.  For
       example, consider a file called title.fr which is a french
       translation  of  the System folder.  This command adds the
       new file to the hierarchy: scoadmin -n title.fr  -p  "Sys-
       tem" When LANG is set to fr, the title for the System file
       is   taken   from   title.fr   file    stored    in    the

                                                                1

       /usr/lib/scoadmin/desktop/System/.foldername    directory.
       specifies the path of the application relative to the root
       of  the  admin  hierarchy.   -P  and -p behave identically
       except when used with -d (delete),  when  -p  removes  all
       folders  along  the  path  and -P preserves the hierarchy.
       specifies an alternative  directory  for  admin  hierarchy
       (normally it is /usr/lib/scoadmin).  causes verbose infor-
       mation to be displayed, for example, messages when  adding
       or  deleting  folders  in  the hierarchy.  adds (copies) a
       hierarchy of objects rooted at directory.   The  directory
       name  will  be  included in the admin hierarchy creating a
       new path (see -P).  adds (copies) the object to the  admin
       hierarchy.   Once an object is added to the hierarchy, you
       can freely move,  remove,  or  modify  the  source  object
       directory  without  affecting  the  hierarchy.  integrates
       (copies) the object into an existing object directory.  If
       a  file  already  exists, the copy is not performed unless
       the -f option is used.  integrates (copies) a hierarchy of
       files into an existing admin hierarchy.  If a file already
       exists, the copy is not performed unless the -f option  is
       used.   detaches  the  specified scoadmin object hierarchy
       directory from the admin hierarchy.  replaces  a  scoadmin
       object  hierarchy  with  another set located in directory.
       replaces an object currently in a admin hierarchy, as with
       a  version  upgrade.   deletes an object from a hierarchy.
       If the object is not at the root of the hierarchy  hierar-
       chy, the path must be specified using either the -p or the
       -P option.   forces  existing  files  to  be  overwritten.
       lists  objects  in the hierarchy by their directory names.
       lists objects in the hierarchy by their titles.   displays
       the  specified  message.  For character applications, mes-
       sages are sent to the standard output.
       -M "messageid [arguments]"
       displays the specified messageid from the message catalog.
       This  supports  the localization of messages in standalone
       invocation.  This can be used  in  activate.scoadmin  file
       (for  example,  when  a user attempts to run a manager but
       has no privilege, instead of invoking the  interface  from
       activate.scoadmin,  scoadmin  -M  can be used to display a
       localized  error  message.  Multiple  arguments  must   be
       enclosed in braces({}).
       displays the specified error message.  For character applications,
       messages are sent to the standard output.

       scoadmin can be used to an object  directly  invoke.   For
       example,  any  of  the  following  commands can be used to

                                                                2

       tem  Time  Manager  scoadmin  system time manager scoadmin
       system t The third example  uses  the  minimum  number  of
       characters  necessary  to  identify the application.  Many
       applications can be invoked with a single character  (such
       as  scoadmin  a for the Account Manager).  If the argument
       supplied is ambiguous, the first application matching  the
       pattern  is  invoked.  You can also invoke a subset of the
       admin hierarchy (for example, scoadmin -p System).

       Assuming the required files have been created as described
       in  the  next step is to copy it into the admin hierarchy.
       If no path is specified, scoadmin places the new object at
       the  top  level  of the hierarchy.  If the object is to be
       placed in a specific location in the hierarchy, use the -p
       option.   This  example adds an object called Foo Demo.obj
       located in /tmp to the admin hierarchy under Demos: scoad-
       min  -p Demos -c /tmp/"Foo Demo.obj" Note that in the ini-
       tial admin hierarchy, the folder  Demos  does  not  exist.
       scoadmin  automatically  creates  intermediate  folders as
       needed.  Ownership of these  folders  is  propagated  down
       from the root of the hierarchy hierarchy.

       The  -d option is used to delete objects from a hierarchy.
       If the object to be deleted is not  at  the  root  of  the
       hierarchy  hierarchy,  the  path  to  it must be specified
       using either the -p or the -P  option.   If  -p  is  used,
       scoadmin  removes folders along the specified path if they
       become empty as a result of this operation.  Using -P pre-
       serves the hierarchy.

       For  example,  if  we  want  to delete the Foo Demo object
       while preserving the empty  Demos  folder,  the  following
       syntax is used: scoadmin -P Demos -d "Foo Demo.obj"

       The  -r option replaces an object currently in a hierarchy
       hierarchy.  This is most useful for  version  upgrades  of
       objects.   It  is  functionally  equivalent to deleting an
       object and recreating it.

       If a new version of the Foo Demo object is  available  and
       it  resides  in  /tmp/Foo  Demo.obj, the following command
       would update the hierarchy hierarchy: scoadmin -p Demos -r
       /tmp/"Foo Demo.obj"

       The -l and -t options examine the configuration of a hier-
       archy hierarchy by directory name and title, respectively.
       For  example,  you can test for the existence of an object
       in the hierarchy as in this example: scoadmin -p Demos  -l
       "Foo  Demo.obj"  These  options  behave  recursively.  For

                                                                3

scoadmin(1M)                                         scoadmin(1M)

       example, to get a list of all the object titles under  the
       System subhierarchy: scoadmin -p System -t

       The  default  behavior for adding new subhierarchies is to
       place them at the top level of the admin hierarchy,  which
       is  accomplished  with the -C option.  For example, if you
       had an object hierarchy in  /u/janedoe/FooAdmin  that  you
       wanted  to  make  accessible  in  the admin hierarchy, you
       would use the  following  command:  scoadmin  -C  /u/jane-
       doe/FooAdmin  This places the new hierarchy in a directory
       called FooAdmin at the top level of the admin hierarchy.

       To attach a hierarchy to  another  location,  use  the  -p
       option.   For  example,  to place the contents of /u/jane-
       doe/FooAdmin in FooTools/FooAdmin, you would use the  fol-
       lowing  command: scoadmin -p FooTools/FooAdmin -C /u/jane-
       doe/FooAdmin Note that the path specified is  relative  to
       the  root of admin hierarchy.  An alternate root directory
       can also be specified using -H.

       Detaching an object hierarchy from admin is achieved using
       the   -D   option,   as   in  this  example:  scoadmin  -D
       FooTools/FooAdmin Use the -R option to replace  an  object
       hierarchy.   For example: scoadmin -p FooTools/FooAdmin -R
       /u/janedoe/FooAdmin

       scoadmin provides a method for objects to display messages
       and errors to the user.  This is accomplished using the -m
       and -e options,  respectively.   If  scoadmin  is  running
       graphically,  messages  and errors issued by an object are
       displayed in message and error boxes.  If,  on  the  other
       hand,  an  object is invoked directly on the command line,
       its errors and messages are simply displayed  on  standard
       out.   This  option  is  designed  to  be used in activate
       scoadmin file to direct messages from scripts that  invoke
       admin applications as described in

       There  are  two  distinct  software  upgrade situations of
       which developers should be  aware.   The  first  of  these
       involves the upgrade of a software component that includes
       a admin object.  The component is responsible for  upgrad-
       ing  its  object  in the hierarchy.  The -r option is used
       for this purpose.  The second situation involves upgrading
       the  admin  hierarchy.   In  this  case,  the upgrade will
       ensure the preservation of the existing  admin  hierarchy.
       Note  that the admin hierarchy is part of the core operat-
       ing system and is not removable.

       admin applications should not be created manually (by sim-
       ply  adding  files  to the hierarchy).  To ensure that all
