       The  mailadmin  utility edits the mail configuration files
       and is available in both graphical and command line modes.
       This manual page describes only the command line mode.

       Executed   without   arguments,  /etc/mail/admin/mailadmin
       starts up the graphical manager. For details of this mode,
       refer to

       The  following  list  details the shell commands and their
       arguments. Multiple commands may be strung together on the
       command  line: if any of them fail, no changes are made to
       the configuration files. Commands with a  variable  number
       of  arguments may be terminated with a double hyphen (--).
       Stop and restart the sendmail daemon. sendmail  should  be
       restarted  after  all changes are completed (note that the
       GUI does this automatically). This  operation  is  carried
       out        by        /etc/mail/sendmailrc.        Rebuilds
       /etc/mail/table/uucp.db from  /usr/lib/uucp/Systems.  This
       only needs to be done if a
        channel  exists  and  the  Systems file has been changed.
       (Note that the GUI does this automatically.)  Adds an  NIS
       alias map or alias file entry. The permissible formats are
       nis:mapname or the full pathname of an alias  file.   Adds
       an  alternate  name  for  this  host.   Adds a new channel
       entry. The table type is one  of  DNS,  ,  local,  remote,
       baduser  and  file.  Deletes an alias map or alias file by
       name.  Deletes an alternate name entry by name.  Deletes a
       channel  entry  by  name.   Gives  a  new alias map order.
       Gives a new alternate names order.  Gives  a  new  channel
       order. Channels using the baduser table type must be spec-
       ified last, and there can be at  most  one  such  channel.
       Lists  alias map names in order.  Lists alternate names in
       order.  Lists channel names in order.  The following  com-
       mands deal with individual properties.  Sets a given prop-
       erty to its default value.  Displays the current value  of
       the  given  property.   Sets a given property to the given
       value.  Property names can be a single token or  they  can
       be  a channel name, followed by a colon and then the prop-
       erty name. Valid property names and their  values  are  as
       follows: General mail properties Host name. The default is
       to use the system name.  From domain name.  Default  (sys-
       temid) is used.  TRUE/FALSE. Enables/disables Domain Table
       (/etc/mail/table/domain).  Message store (folder)  proper-
       ties  INBOX directory. A zero length string indicates that
       the user's home directory is to be used.   INBOX  name.  A
       zero length string indicates that the user's login name is
       to be used.  MMDF/Sendmail:  the  default  folder  format.
       TRUE/FALSE:    enables/disables    O_FSYNC   on   folders.

                                                                1

       TRUE/FALSE: enables/disables extended consistency  checks.
       TRUE/FALSE: enables/disables incore caching of entire mail
       folders.  A value in the range  0,...,100.  Specifies  the
       percentage  of  the file that must be maintained as valid.
       100 means maximum compatibility,  50  for  higher  perfor-
       mance.  A value in the range 1,...,999. Specifies the file
       lock timeout for mail folders.  TRUE/FALSE: enable/disable
       file  based  locking  on  mail folders.  folder.lock files
       will be used.  Kernel  locking  is  always  enabled.  This
       option  adds  file  based  locking.   A value in the range
       0,...,0777. Sets the mask for mail  folder  and  directory
       creation.   Channel  properties  (must  be  preceeded with
       channel name and a colon) Channel name: no white space  is
       permitted,  domain  is  a reserved name, and names must be
       unique. baduser, badhost, multihome, and local are treated
       specially,  as they are translated into local names in the
       GUI based on the locale.  Channel  program  (P=).  Specify
       either a path name or ``[IPC]'' for SMTP.  Channel program
       arguments (A=). Note  that  $h  (host  part  of  recipient
       address)  and $u (user name part of recipient address) are
       special to sendmail.  Channel program execution directory.
       The  default  is /var/spool/mqueue.  One of DNS, , remote,
       local, file, baduser, or channel table type.  The  baduser
       channel  is  special:  it must be specified last and there
       can be only one.  The channel table file,  only  used  for
       channel  tables  of type file.  Specifies the host through
       which all mail for this channel will be routed.  Set  this
       option  to  a  zero  length string to remove this routing.
       This value is ignored for file  table  channels.   Channel
       program  flags (F=).  Channel program end of line (usually
       \n, although SMTP requires  \r\n).   The  maximum  message
       size.  0 means no maximum.  The maximum line size. 0 means
       no maximum. 990 is expected to be  set  for  all  channels
       that  use  SMTP,  while most others use 0.  A value in the
       range -20,...,20 (N=). The channel program nice increment.
       0  is  the  default  value.  user:group (U=). The user and
       group to be used to run the channel  program.  If  set  to
       zero  length  string,  then  bin:bin (1:1) is used.  enve-
       lope[/header]. The envelope and header recipient rulesets.
       &gemini;     defines     ap822_re/ap822_rh    for    SMTP,
       ap975_re/ap976_rh  for  ,  and  aplocal_re/aplocal_rh  for
       local  delivery.  Custom  channels will generally want the
       RFC822 rewriting rules.  envelope[/header].  The  envelope
       and    header    sender    rulesets.    &gemini;   defines
       ap822_se/ap822_sh for SMTP, ap975_se/ap976_sh  for  ,  and
       aplocal_se/aplocal_sh  for  local delivery.  For a compre-
       hensive reference to sendmail rulesets,  mailer  arguments
