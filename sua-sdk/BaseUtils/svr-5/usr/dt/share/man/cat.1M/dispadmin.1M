       The  dispadmin  command displays or changes process sched-
       uler parameters while the system is running.

       The -l option lists the scheduler classes  currently  con-
       figured in the system.

       The  -c option specifies the class whose parameters are to
       be displayed or changed.

       The -g option gets the parameters for the specified  class
       and  writes  them  to the standard output.  Parameters for
       the time-sharing class are described on parameters for the
       fixed  priority  class are described on and parameters for
       the fixed class are described on

       When using the -g option you may also use the -r option to
       specify  a  resolution  to be used for outputting the time
       quantum values.  If no resolution is specified, time quan-
       tum  values  are  in milliseconds.  If res is specified it
       must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000000000 inclu-
       sive,  and the resolution used is the reciprocal of res in
       seconds.  For example, a res value of 10 yields time quan-
       tum values expressed in tenths of a second; a res value of
       1000000 yields time quantum values expressed in  microsec-
       onds.  If the time quantum cannot be expressed as an inte-
       ger in the specified resolution, it is rounded up  to  the
       next integral multiple of the specified resolution.

       The  -s option sets scheduler parameters for the specified
       class using the values in file.   These  values  overwrite
       the  current  values in memory--they become the parameters
       that control scheduling  of  processes  in  the  specified
       class.  The values in file must be in the format output by
       the -g option.  Moreover, the values must describe a table
       that is the same size (has same number of priority levels)
       as the table being  overwritten.   Appropriate  privileges
       are required in order to use the -s option.

       The  -g and -s options are mutually exclusive: you may not
       retrieve the table at the same time  you  are  overwriting
       it.

       dispadmin  does some limited sanity checking on the values
       supplied in file to verify  that  they  are  within  their
       required  bounds.   The sanity checking, however, does not
       attempt to analyze the effect that the new values have  on

                                                                1

       the  performance  of the system.  Inappropriate values can
       have a dramatic negative effect on system performance.

       The following  command  retrieves  the  current  scheduler
       parameters for the fixed priority class from kernel memory
       and writes them to the standard output.  Time quantum val-
       ues are in microseconds.  dispadmin -c FP -g -r 1000000 To
       overwrite the current scheduler parameters for  the  fixed
       priority  class  with  the  values specified in fp.config,
       ienter: dispadmin -c FP -s fp.config The following command
       retrieves  the  current scheduler parameters for the time-
       sharing class from kernel memory and writes  them  to  the
       standard  output.  Time quantum values are in nanoseconds.
       dispadmin -c TS -g -r 1000000000 To overwrite the  current
       scheduler  parameters  for the time-sharing class with the
       values specified in ts.config, enter: dispadmin -c  TS  -s
       ts.config

       dispadmin  prints  an appropriate diagnostic message if it
       fails to overwrite the current scheduler parameters due to
       lack  of required permissions or a problem with the speci-
       fied input file.
