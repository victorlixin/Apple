       One  of  the Installable Driver Tools (idtools) for kernel
       configuration, idmodload loads all the configured loadable
       kernel modules listed in /etc/loadmods, or in another file
       as specified with the -f option.  A kernel module is  con-
       sidered  to  be  configured  if one or more entries in the
       module's sdevice file contains the value Y in the  config-
       ure field.

       The  idmodload  command  is  executed automatically (by on
       every system reboot in sysinit state.  This command is not
       intended  to  be  executed  directly and may be changed or
       eliminated in a future release.

       idmodload takes the following options: load all  the  con-
       figured loadable kernel modules listed in modlist, instead
       of the default file, /etc/loadmods use all the  configura-
       tion  information under the root directory, instead of the
       default directory, /etc/conf print debugging information

       An exit value of zero  indicates  success.   If  an  error
       occurs,  an  error message is reported for each error, and
       the command exits with a return value of 1.  If the  error
       is  a  failure  in loading a module, an error message with
       the module name and module type is included with the error
       message,  then  the command continues processing the other
       modules listed in /etc/loadmods.
