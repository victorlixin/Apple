DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The sdimkosr5 command converts a hard disk that has previ-
       ously been initialized for &everest; to the  &gemini;-sup-
       ported  raw  disk  format.  This allows raw disk access of
       existing &everest; databases either for direct reading  or
       as input to filesystem conversion tools.

   OOppttiioonnss
       sdimkosr5  takes  the  following option: Specifies the raw
       device containing the disk to be converted.  For  example:
       sdimkosr5 /dev/rdsk/c1b0t0d0s0

UUssaaggee
       The  sdimkosr5  command  uses  the absolute Read and Write
       ioctls to extract the table.  It then determines which  is
       the  active &everest; partition, extracts the divvy infor-
       mation, and writes it to  disk  in  a  &gemini;-compatible
       VTOC format.

       In a &gemini; environment, a converted disk has no support
       for new bad block  (&gemini;)  or  bad  track  (&everest;)
       remapping,  but  previously  remapped bad tracks are still
       maintained.

       This command cannot be run on the boot disk.

       sdimkosr5 returns 0 upon success,  an  error  message  and
       non-zero return value otherwise.
