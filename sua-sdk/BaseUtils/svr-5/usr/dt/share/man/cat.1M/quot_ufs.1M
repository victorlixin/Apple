       generic_options are options supported by the generic  quot
       command.

       quot  displays  the  number  of blocks (1024 bytes) in the
       named filesystem currently owned by each user.  There is a
       limit  of 2048 blocks.  Files larger than this are counted
       as a 2048 block file, but the total blocks  count  remains
       correct.

       Specify the ufs FSType. If -F ufs is not specified heuris-
       tics similiar to those used by are used to  determine  the
       file  system  type.  This command executes faster if it is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify  the  -F  ufs.   Generate a report for all mounted
       filesystems.  Display three columns giving a file size  in
       blocks, the number of files of that size, and a cumulative
       total of blocks containing files of that size or a smaller
       size.   Files  exceeding  499  blocks  are  listed  as 499
       blocks.  The last line always lists 499  blocks,  even  if
       there  are no files of that size.  Display count of number
       of files as well as space owned by each user.  This option
       is  incompatible with the -c and -v options.  Estimate the
       number of blocks in the file -- this does not account  for
       files  with  holes  in  them.  Attach names to the list of
       files read from standard input.  quot -n  cannot  be  used
       alone,  because  it expects data from standard input.  For
       example, the pipeline ncheck filesystem | sort +0n |  quot
       -n  filesystem produces a list of all files and their own-
       ers.  This option is incompatible with all other  options.
       In  addition  to the default output, display three columns
       containing the number of blocks not accessed in  the  last
       30, 60, and 90 days.
