       These  daemons implement the license policy manager.  When
       you execute  software, it checks with ifor_pmd  to  verify
       that  it is licensed.  If the software is not licensed, it
       will not run.  The ifor_pmd daemon is started during  sys-
       tem  initialization  by an entry in the /etc/inittab file.
       It in turn starts up the  ifor_sld  and  sco_cpd  daemons.
       The sco_cpd daemon verifies that the licenses on a network
       are unique.

       The -b option to ifor_pmd forces ifor_pmd to  run  in  the
       foreground.  It runs in the background by default.

       ifor_pmd,  ifor_sld,  and  sco_cpd  must  never be killed.
       Without them, the system does not work properly.  Attempts
       to  execute  licensed applications in the absence of these
       daemons  generate  messages  similar  to  this:  app_name:
       ERROR-    Failed    to    initialize    policy    manager.
       (IFOR_PM_FATAL) Under normal circumstances, ifor_pmd  will
       restart   automatically  if  the  ifor_pmd,  ifor_sld,  or
       sco_cpd daemon terminates.  Use to verify that these  dae-
       mons are running.  If you determine that they are not run-
       ning, log in as root and enter  ifor_pmd.   Rebooting  the
       system will also restart ifor_pmd.
