       makewhatis writes entries for local manual pages to a key-
       word database in format.  A keyword database file  can  be
       used by the utilities and

       Only root can use makewhatis.

       makewhatis  looks  in  the  specified directory(s) for the
       troff source of the manual pages to add.  The  directories
       must  be  subdirectories  of  the standard root for manual
       pages       /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man       (/usr/lib/sco-
       help/en_US.ISO8859-1/man is linked to /usr/man for compat-
       ibility with &everestTM;).  This path can be changed using
       the environment variable.

       Each  entry in whatis consists of a line specifying a man-
       ual page name,  its  section,  and  a  short  description.
       makewhatis uses troff source that must contain the follow-
       ing standard man key lines in this order: .TH name section
       .SH  NAME  name  \-  single-line description makewhatis is
       flexible in what it accepts in the manual page source: The
       case  of  the string ``NAME'' is arbitrary.  The amount of
       whitespace between the elements of a key line is arbitrary
       as  long  as  there  is  some.  There can be any number of
       blank or non-blank lines between the key lines.  The  dash
       separating the manual page name and its description can be
       one of -, --, \-, \-\-, \(mi, or \(em.  For  example,  the
       source  for  this  manual page might look like: .TH  make-
       whatis 1M .\" Note the mixed case of NAME below  .SH  NaMe
       .\"  This  comment  line  is ignored makewhatis     \- add
       entries to the keyword database This produces the  follow-
       ing  keyword  database  entry:  makewhatis  (1M)     - add
       entries to the keyword database
