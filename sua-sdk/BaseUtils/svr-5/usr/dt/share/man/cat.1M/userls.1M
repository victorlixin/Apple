       userls lists the configured user accounts, the  attributes
       associated with a user account, or the user accounts asso-
       ciated with a group.

       The output of userls is attribute value pairs enclosed  in
       braces, which is suitable for use in an option file for

       The  following  options  are  supported: Sends all options
       associated with the specified group accounts  to  standard
       output in extended option syntax (parsable from a datafile
       by the -X option).  Lists all attributes  associated  with
       the  specified  user(s).   Selects  logins  with duplicate
       UIDs.   Display  multiple  group  membership  information.
       Format  output  into  one  line of colon-delimited fields.
       Specify all users belonging  to  group.   Multiple  groups
       must  be separated by commas.  If group comprises entirely
       numeric characters it is treated as a group ID;  otherwise
       it  is  treated  as  a group name.  Display the user name,
       user ID, group ID and comment in a format parsable by  the
       extended  option  syntax.   If  user does not exist and it
       consists entirely of numeric characters, it is interpreted
       as  a UID.  Multiple login names must be separated by com-
       mas.  List extended account attributes.   Most  attributes
       are  account  parameters  that  can be changed; the userls
       command can only be used to query them.  See  for  a  com-
       plete list of attributes.  Specify the file from which the
       user attributes are to be taken.
