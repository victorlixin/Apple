       strclean  is  used  to  clean  up the STREAMS error logger
       directory on a regular basis (for example, by using cron).
       By  default,  all  files  with  names  matching error.* in
       /var/adm/streams that have not been modified in  the  last
       three   days   are   removed.    A  directory  other  than
       /var/adm/streams can be specified  using  the  -d  option.
       The  maximum  age  in  days  for a log file can be changed
       using the -a option.

       strclean is typically run from cron on a daily  or  weekly
       basis.

       strclean  -d  /var/adm/streams -a 3 has the same result as
       running strclean with no arguments.
