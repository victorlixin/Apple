       removef  informs  the  system  that the user, or software,
       intends to remove a pathname.  Output from removef is  the
       list  of  input  pathnames  that may be safely removed (no
       other packages have a dependency on them).

       When the second synopsis is used,  the  pathname  descrip-
       tions will be read from standard input. These descriptions
       are the same as would be given in the first synopsis,  but
       the information is given in the form of a list.

       After  all  files  have  been processed, removef should be
       invoked with the -f option to indicate the  removal  phase
       is  complete.   Name  of  package  instance with which the
       pathname should be associated.

       Indicates the removal phase is complete.  This  option  is
       used with removef when all files have been processed.

       The  following  shows  the  use  of removef in an optional
       post-install script: echo  "The  following  files  are  no
       longer part of this package \      and are being removed."
       removef $PKGINST /dev/xt[0-9][0-9][0-9] | while read path-
       name  do       echo  "$pathname"      rm -f $pathname done
       removef -f $PKGINST || exit 2

       Using multiple  invocations  is  discouraged  if  standard
       input  style invocations can be used with a list of files.
       This will be much faster because the contents file must be
       searched  for  each entry.  language-specific message file
