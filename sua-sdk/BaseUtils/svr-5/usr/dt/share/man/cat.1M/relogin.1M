       The  relogin  command changes the terminal line field of a
       user's utmp entry to the name of  the  windowing  terminal
       layer  attached to standard input.  write messages sent to
       this user are directed to this layer.   In  addition,  the
       who command will show the user associated with this layer.
       relogin may only be invoked under layers.

       relogin is invoked automatically by layers to set the utmp
       entry to the terminal line of the first layer created upon
       startup, and to reset the utmp entry to the real  line  on
       termination.   It  may be invoked by a user to designate a
       different layer to receive write messages.  Suppress error
       messages.  Specifies which utmp entry to change.  The utmp
       file is searched for an  entry  with  the  specified  line
       field.   That field is changed to the line associated with
       the standard input.  (To learn what lines  are  associated
       with  a  given user, say jdoe, type ps -f -u jdoe and note
       the values shown in the TTY field (see
