       This  description only applies to &geminiTM; up to Release
       7.1.1.  &juplong; uses the nddmdid daemon to replace dlpid
       as  well  as performing other functions.  The dlpid daemon
       is called from the network  driver  start/stop  script  to
       link  an  instance  of the common DLPI (Data Link Provider
       Interface) module  to  each  MDI  (MAC  Driver  Interface)
       driver instance using I_LINK STREAMS ioctls.

       The  DLPI module provides common media-dependent services:
       MAC (Media Access Control) frame multiplexing and  de-mul-
       tiplexing.   LLC  Class  1,  a common low-level networking
       protocol that is used  by  ,  NetBEUI,  and  OSI.   It  is
       required  by  SNAP.  SNAP (Sub Network Access Protocol), a
       low-level networking protocol that  enables  Ethernet-ori-
       ented  stacks  (such as ) to run on non-Ethernet networks.
       source routing, a low-level networking  protocol  used  by
       ring  topology  networks  (such as Token Ring and FDDI) to
       enable frames to traverse multiple connected  rings.   The
       MDI  drivers  are  specific to network adapter types; they
       simply pass STREAMS message blocks between the DLPI module
       and the adapter, queuing frames before transmission if the
       hardware is busy.

       The dlpid daemon is started in the background  by  /etc/nd
       start and remains active while the system is in multi user
       mode. dlpid opens the DLPI and MDI device files, and keeps
       them linked and ready for protocol stack use.

       The dlpid pipe is /etc/inst/nd/dlpidPIPE.
