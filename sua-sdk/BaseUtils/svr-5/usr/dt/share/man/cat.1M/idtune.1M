       One  of  the ID/TP kernel configuration tools, idtune sets
       or gets  the  value  of  an  existing  tunable  parameter.
       idtune  is  called  by  a  Driver  Software  Package (DSP)
       installation or removal script; it  can  also  be  invoked
       directly  as a user-level command.  New tunable parameters
       must be installed using and a DSP Mtune file  before  they
       can be accessed using idtune.

       Note  that existing tunable parameter values must be modi-
       fied using the idtune command.

       There are three different ways to use the idtune  command,
       which are explained in the ``Usage'' section.

   OOppttiioonnss
       Force  the  change  of the tunable parameter parm to value
       and suppress all confirmation messages.  If the -c  option
       is  used with the -f option, the values in both stune.cur-
       rent and stune are changed; otherwise,  only  the  tunable
       parameter value in stune is changed.  This option does not
       apply to string tunables.  Change the value of  parm,  but
       only if the existing value is smaller than the value spec-
       ified by this idtune command.  If the -c  option  is  used
       with  the  -m option, the values in both stune.current and
       stune are changed; otherwise, only the  tunable  parameter
       value  in  stune is changed.  Apply the change to the tun-
       able parameter in both stune and stune.current.  Note that
       all changes made to stune.current will affect any loadable
       kernel modules configured thereafter, and can  potentially
       create  inconsistencies between the running kernel and the
       new loadable kernel modules.   For  this  reason,  the  -c
       option  should  be used with caution.  Print the following
       sequence of values (separated by white space)  to  stdout:
       the  current  value  of  the tunable parameter the default
       value, from the Mtune entry the minimum valid value,  from
       the  Mtune  entry  the maximum valid value, from the Mtune
       entry

       Only the first two values apply to string  tunables.   For
       tunables  that  are  autotuned by default and have not had
       this autotuning overridden with  a  specific  value  using
       idtune,  the  values  shown  are for the present amount of
       memory.  If they have been overridden, the default,  mini-
       mum, and maximum are for the present amount of memory, and
       the current is the specified value.

       If the -c option is used with the -g option,  the  current
       value  in  the  kernel  currently  running  is  displayed;

                                                                1

idtune(1M)                                             idtune(1M)

       otherwise, the value that will be used in the next  system
       build  is  displayed.   Reset the tunable parameter to its
       default value.  If the tunable is  autotuned  by  default,
       resets  it  to  autotuning.  If the -c option is used with
       the -d option, the values in both stune.current and  stune
       are  reset; otherwise, only the tunable parameter value in
       stune is reset.  All confirmation messages are suppressed.

       The  first  form of the idtune command, with no options or
       with -f or -m, is used to change the value of a parameter.
       The  tunable parameter to be changed is indicated by parm,
       and the desired value for the tunable parameter is  value.

       By  default,  if  the  parameter  in  the stune file has a
       value, you are prompted to confirm  the  change  with  the
       following message: Tunable Parameter parm is currently set
       to old_value in
         /etc/conf/cf.d/stune Is it OK to  change  it  to  value?
       (y/n)  If  the  parameter is autotuned by default, you are
       prompted to confirm the change (which will override  auto-
       tuning)  with  the message: Tunable Parameter parm is cur-
       rently autotuned.  Is it OK to change it to  value?  (y/n)
       For either of these questions, if you answer y, the change
       is made.  Otherwise, the tunable  parameter  will  not  be
       changed, and the following message is displayed: parm left
       at old_value However, if you use the  -f  (force)  option,
       the change is always made and no messages are reported.

       If you use the -m (minimum) option, and there is an exist-
       ing value which is greater  than  the  desired  value,  no
       change  is made and no messages are reported.  This option
       only applies to integer tunables.

       If you use the -c (current) option with the first form  of
       the  idtune  command, the change applies to both stune and
       stune.current; otherwise, only the  tunable  parameter  in
       stune  is  affected.   Because  any  change  made  to  the
       stune.current file will affect  all  the  loadable  kernel
       modules  configured  thereafter, it is very easy to intro-
       duce inconsistencies between the currently running  kernel
       and  the  new  loadable  kernel  modules.   Therefore, you
       should be extremely careful when using the -c option.

       If you are modifying system tunable parameters as part  of
       a  device  driver or application add-on package, you might
       want to change parameter  values  without  prompting  Your
       add-on  package Install script could override the existing
       value using the -f or -m options.  However,  you  must  be
       careful  not  to  invalidate  a tunable parameter modified
       earlier by the user or another add-on package.

       Any attempt to set a parameter  to  a  value  outside  the
       valid  minimum/maximum  (as given in the Mtune file) range

                                                                2

idtune(1M)                                             idtune(1M)

       will be reported as an error, even when using the -f or -m
       options.   No validation is performed for string tunables.

       The (R) system kernel must be rebuilt (using and the  sys-
       tem  rebooted  for any changes to tunable parameter values
       in stune to take effect.
