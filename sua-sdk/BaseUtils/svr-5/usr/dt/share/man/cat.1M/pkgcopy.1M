       The  pkgcopy  command  copies  a  software  package from a
       server to the /var/spool/dist directory on the local host.
       Once a package is copied, that instance of the package can
       be installed or distributed on other  hosts  via  the  and
       pkgcopy   commands,  respectively.   This  feature  allows
       administrators to set up  multiple  hosts  as  originating
       hosts for software.

       Another  way  to  create  a  package  image  that  can  be
       installed or distributed to other hosts is by use  of  the
       command.

       ifies the software source for the copy.   The  format  for
       the source location is either:

       host:[device] or [host]:device

       where:  is  the  name or Internet address (IP) of the host
       where the package(s) to be distributed  reside  (that  is,
       the  IP  address  of  the  Install Server).  When the host
       argument is omitted, the local host (the system where pkg-
       copy  is  invoked)  is  assumed.   Indicates the device or
       directory where the software that is being copied resides.
       Alternatively,  the device argument may be a file contain-
       ing a data stream in pkgadd format.  The full path name of
       the  device  (for  example,  /dev/rmt/c0s0), directory, or
       file must be used.  provides the short name,  as  returned
       by the command, of the software package to copy.

       If  the  source  directory is a directory containing pack-
       age(s), then you must specify the package option.  If  the
       source  device  is  a  package datastream, then you do not
       need to specify the package option.  If the package option
       is  omitted,  you  are  prompted for which set(s) or pack-
       age(s) you want to copy from that data stream.

       This feature works the same as in which is the  underlying
       mechanism used by pkgcopy for copying software.

       also mailed to root.
