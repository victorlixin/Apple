       The pkglist command displays  information  about  software
       available on a remote host.

       turns   on  verbose  output  mode  and  causes  additional
       description  of  pkglist  events  to  be  written  to  the
       /var/sadm/dist/log  log file.  Specifies  (default).  dis-
       plays information about packages that belong to  category.
       (Categories  are  defined  in  the  category  field of the
       pkginfo file.  See for details.)  More than  one  category
       may be specified, in a comma-separated list.  The package-
       to-category match is not case-sensitive.  If the  category
       specified  is  set, pkglist will display information about
       Set Installation Packages (SIPs).  specifies the  software
       source  for  the listing.  The format for the source loca-
       tion is either:

       host:[device] or [host]:device

       where: is the name or Internet address (IP)  of  the  host
       where  the  package(s)  reside (that is, the IP address of
       the Install Server).  When the host argument  is  omitted,
       the  local  host  (the system where pkglist is invoked) is
       assumed.  Indicates the  device  or  directory  where  the
       software  resides.  Alternatively, the device argument may
       be a file containing a data stream in pkgadd format.   The
       full path name of the device (for example, /dev/rmt/c0s0),
       directory, or file must be used.

       When the device argument is omitted,  the  /var/spool/dist
       directory  is used.  selects which software package(s) are
       listed.  To specify  package(s),  use  the  short  package
       name(s)  as returned by the command.  The token all may be
       used instead to request that all  the  packages  available
       from source be listed.

       Each  session  (on both the server and client side) gener-
       ates a log which is appended to  the  system-wide  logfile
       /var/sadm/dist/log  after  completion.  The session log is
       also mailed to root.
