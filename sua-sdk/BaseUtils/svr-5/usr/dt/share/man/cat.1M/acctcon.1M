       acctcon  converts  a  sequence  of login/logoff records to
       total accounting records (see the tacct format in  acctcon
       reads  login/logoff records from standard input.  The file
       /var/adm/wtmp is usually the source  of  the  login/logoff
       records, however, because it may contain corrupted records
       or system date changes, it should  first  be  fixed  using
       wtmpfix.  The fixed version of file /var/adm/wtmp can then
       be redirected to acctcon.  The tacct records  are  written
       to  standard  output.   Here  are the options for acctcon:
       file is created to contain a summary of line usage showing
       line  name,  number  of  minutes used, percentage of total
       elapsed time used, number of sessions charged,  number  of
       logins, and number of logoffs.  This file helps track line
       usage, identify bad lines, and find software and  hardware
       oddities.  Hangup, termination of login and termination of
       the login shell each generate logoff records, so that  the
       number  of logoffs is often three to four times the number
       of sessions.  See and  file  is  filled  with  an  overall
       record  for  the  accounting period, giving starting time,
       ending  time,  number  of  reboots,  and  number  of  date
       changes.

       acctcon  is  a  combination  of  the programs acctcon1 and
       acctcon2.  acctcon1 converts login/logoff  records,  taken
       from the fixed /var/adm/wtmp file, to ASCII output.  acct-
       con2 reads the ASCII records produced by acctcon1 and con-
       verts  them  to  tacct records.  acctcon1 can be used with
       the -l and -o options, described above, as  well  as  with
       the  following  options:  Print  input  only, showing line
       name, login name, and time (in both numeric and  date/time
       formats).   acctcon1  maintains  a  list of lines on which
       users are logged in.  When  it  reaches  the  end  of  its
       input,  it emits a session record for each line that still
       appears to be active.  It normally assumes that its  input
       is a current file, so that it uses the current time as the
       ending time for each session still in  progress.   The  -t
       flag causes it to use, instead, the last time found in its
       input, thus assuring reasonable and repeatable numbers for
       non-current files.

       The  acctcon command is typically used as follows: acctcon

                                                                1

       -l lineuse -o reboots < tmpwtmp > ctacct

       The acctcon1 and acctcon2 commands are typically  used  as
       follows:  acctcon1  -l lineuse -o reboots < tmpwtmp | sort
       +1n +2 > ctmp acctcon2 < ctmp > ctacct

       The line usage report is confused by  date  changes.   Use
       wtmpfix  (see  with the /var/adm/wtmp file as an argument,
       to correct this situation.
