       mknod makes a directory entry for a special file.

       name  is  the special file to be created. The second argu-
       ment is either b, to indicate a block-type  special  file,
       or  c,  to  indicate a character-type.  The last two argu-
       ments are numbers specifying the major  and  minor  device
       numbers;  these  may  be  either  decimal  or  octal.  The
       assignment of major device numbers  is  specific  to  each
       system.  You must be a privileged user to use this form of
       the command.

       The second case is used to create a FIFO (named pipe).

       The NFS version 2 protocol does not  provide  for  sending
       the  file  type  to  the  server  as part of an NFS create
       request. This causes mknod to not work for most file types
       other than S_IFREG, S_IFIFO, S_IFCHR and S_FBLK.
