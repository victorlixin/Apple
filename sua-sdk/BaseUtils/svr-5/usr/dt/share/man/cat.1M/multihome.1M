       The multihome admin manager allows you to administer users
       within multiple domains on your system.

       When entered with no arguments, or called from  the  admin
       launcher,  the  graphical  user  interface is called. When
       given command-line arguments, the graphical user interface
       is  bypassed and changes are made directly to the configu-
       ration files.

       Multiple commands may be strung together on a single  com-
       mand line. If any of them fail no changes are made to con-
       figuration files.

       Output a list of virtual domains.  Output a list of  users
       contained  in  that virtual domain.  The virtual usernames
       are listed in the first column, followed by their physical
       user  name  in  the  second.  Delete a virtual user from a
       domain name.  Add a virtual user to a  domain.   Retire  a
       system  user  from  all  virtual  domains.  Get the remote
       alias file for a domain.  Put the remote alias file for  a
       domain.  Rebuild domain database file from  configuration.
       This must be done whenever virtual domains  are  added  or
       deleted.  This is done automatically in GUI mode.
