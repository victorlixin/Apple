       zic  reads text from the file(s) named on the command line
       and creates the time conversion information  files  speci-
       fied  in  this  input.  If a filename is `-', the standard
       input is read.

       Input lines are made up of fields.  Fields  are  separated
       by  any  number  of  white  space characters.  Leading and
       trailing white space on input lines is ignored.   A  pound
       sign  (#)  in the input introduces a comment which extends
       to the end of the line the pound sign appears  on.   White
       space characters and pound signs may be enclosed in double
       quotes (") if they're to be used as part of a field.   Any
       line  that  is blank (after comment stripping) is ignored.
       Non-blank lines are expected to be of one of three  types:
       rule lines, zone lines, and link lines.

       A rule line has the form Rule  NAME  FROM   TO   TYPE   IN
       ON   AT   SAVE   LETTER/S For example: Rule    USA    1969
       1973   -   Apr   lastSun   2:00   1:00   D The fields that
       make up a rule line are: Gives the (arbitrary) name of the
       set  of  rules this rule is part of.  Gives the first year
       in which the rule applies.  The word minimum (or an abbre-
       viation)  means the minimum year with a representable time
       value.  The word maximum (or an  abbreviation)  means  the
       maximum  year  with a representable time value.  Gives the
       final year in which the rule applies.  In addition to min-
       imum and maximum (as above), the word only (or an abbrevi-
       ation) may be used to repeat the value of the FROM  field.
       Gives the type of year in which the rule applies.  If TYPE
       is `-' then the rule applies in all years between FROM and
       TO  inclusive;  if  TYPE is uspres, the rule applies in US
       Presidential election years; if TYPE is nonpres, the  rule
       applies  in  years  other  than  US  Presidential election
       years.  If TYPE is something else, then zic  executes  the
       command  yearistype year type to check the type of a year:
       an exit status of zero is taken to mean that the  year  is
       of  the given type; an exit status of one is taken to mean
       that the year is not of the given type.  Names  the  month
       in which the rule takes effect.  Month names may be abbre-
       viated.  Gives the day on which  the  rule  takes  effect.
       Recognized  forms include: the fifth of the month the last
       Sunday in the month the last Monday  in  the  month  first
       Sunday on or after the eighth last Sunday on or before the
       25th

       Names of days of the week may be  abbreviated  or  spelled
       out  in full.  Note: there must be no spaces within the ON
       field.  Gives the time of day  at  which  the  rule  takes
       effect.  Recognized  forms  include: time in hours time in
       hours and minutes 24-hour format  time  (for  times  after

                                                                1

zic(1M)                                                   zic(1M)

       noon) time in hours, minutes, and seconds

       Any  of these forms may be followed by the letter w if the
       given time is local ``wall clock'' time or s if the  given
       time is local ``standard'' time; in the absence of w or s,
       wall clock time is assumed.  Gives the amount of  time  to
       be  added  to  local  standard  time  when  the rule is in
       effect.  This field has the same format as  the  AT  field
       (although,  of course, the w and s suffixes are not used).
       Gives the ``variable part'' (for  example,  the  ``S''  or
       ``D'' in ``EST'' or ``EDT'') of time zone abbreviations to
       be used when this rule is in effect.   If  this  field  is
       `-', the variable part is null.

       A zone line has the form Zone   NAME   GMTOFF   RULES/SAVE
       FORMAT   [UNTIL] For example:  Zone    PRC    8:00     PRC
       C%sT  The fields that make up a zone line are: The name of
       the time zone. This is the name used in creating the  time
       conversion  information  file for the zone.  The amount of
       time to add to GMT to get  standard  time  in  this  zone.
       This  field  has the same format as the AT and SAVE fields
       of rule lines; begin the field with a minus sign  if  time
       must be subtracted from GMT.  The name of the rule(s) that
       apply in the time zone or, alternately, an amount of  time
       to  add to local standard time.  If this field is `-' then
       standard time always applies in the time zone.  The format
       for  time  zone abbreviations in this time zone.  The pair
       of characters %s is used  to  show  where  the  ``variable
       part''  of  the  time zone abbreviation goes.  The time at
       which the GMT offset or the rule(s) change for a location.
       It  is  specified as a year, a month, a day, and a time of
       day.  If this is specified, the time zone  information  is
       generated  from the given GMT offset and rule change until
       the time specified.

       The next line must be a ``continuation''  line;  this  has
       the  same  form  as  a  zone  line  except that the string
       ``Zone'' and the name are  omitted,  as  the  continuation
       line will place information starting at the time specified
       as the UNTIL field in the previous line in the  file  used
       by  the  previous line.  Continuation lines may contain an
       UNTIL field, just as zone lines do,  indicating  that  the
       next line is a further continuation.

       A  link line has the form Link    LINK-FROM    LINK-TO For
       example: Link    US/Eastern    EST5EDT The LINK-FROM field
       should  appear  as  the  NAME field in some zone line; the
       LINK-TO field is used as an alternate name for that  zone.

       Except  for  continuation  lines,  lines may appear in any
       order in the input.

       For  areas with more than two types of local time, you may
       need to use local standard time in the  AT  field  of  the
       earliest  transition time's rule to ensure that the earli-
       est transition time recorded in the compiled file is  cor-
       rect.
