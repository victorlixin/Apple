       The memsize command reports memory size in bytes.  If mul-
       tiple options are specified, they are reported  in  space-
       separated  fields.   If  dumpfile  is given as an operand,
       memsize reports the dump's size.  The -a, -d, -g, -l,  -t,
       and -u options cannot be used on a dump file.

       memsize takes the following options: Report values for all
       types of memory, with labels.  Although  all  three  argu-
       ments  are  optional, you must supply at least one for the
       -f option to be meaningful.  Values are  reported  in  the
       number of units specified (1 is the default), and N can be
       any arbitrary  integer.   You  can  specify  precision  by
       including a decimal point followed by the n number of dig-
       its of floating point precision.  By default, memory  size
       is  reported  in bytes, but you can use an optional, case-
       insensitive scale tag to report kilobytes megabytes  giga-
       bytes pages, given the current page size.

       Note  that all integer divisions are rounded up. For exam-
       ple, memsize -fg reports 1 if your system has <= 1GB,  and
       reports  2  if your system has >1GB and <= 2GB.  Floating-
       point divisions (triggered by a  -f1000.1g  returns  0.0).
       The -f option is very flexible but, in practice, there are
       only a few useful cases.   In  particular,  dumpcheck  and
       dumpsave  use memsize -f512 to get 32-bit results that can
       be used for dd  block  sizes.   Report  dedicated  memory.
       Report  general  memory.   Report  portion of memory (with
       page identity) that  can  be  used  to  cache  file  data.
       Report  total  memory.  Report usable memory.  This is the
       default.  Print a label following the value.
