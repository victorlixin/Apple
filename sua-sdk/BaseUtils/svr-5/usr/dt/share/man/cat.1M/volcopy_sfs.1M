       generic_options  are options supported by the generic vol-
       copy command.  current_options are  options  supported  by
       the s5-specific module of volcopy.

       volcopy makes a literal copy of the sfs filesystem using a
       blocksize matched to the device.

       Specify the sfs FSType. If -F sfs is not specified heuris-
       tics  similiar  to those used by are used to determine the
       file system type.  This command executes faster if  it  is
       not required to autodetect file system types. If possible,
       specify  the  -F  sfs.   Invoke  a  verification  sequence
       requiring  a  positive  operator  response  instead of the
       standard 10-second delay before the copy is made.  A posi-
       tive  response  is  always  required  to override warnings
       about mismatched system names.

       Other options are used with  both  9-track  and  cartridge
       tapes (cartridge tapes are treated as if they were 9-track
       tapes.)  bits per inch size of reel in feet beginning reel
       number  for  a restarted copy use double buffered I/O pro-
       cess until the end of tape, then ask for the next tape  in
       sequence.

       If  the  -e  option  is not selected, the program requests
       length and density information if this is not given on the
       command  line  or  if  it is not recorded on an input tape
       label.  If the filesystem is too large to fit on one reel,
       volcopy prompts for additional reels.  Labels of all reels
       are checked.  Tapes may be mounted alternately on  two  or
       more  drives.   If  volcopy is interrupted, it asks if the
       user wants to quit or  wants  to  escape  to  the  command
       interpreter.   In  the  latter  case, the user can perform
       other operations (such as labelit) and return  to  volcopy
       by  exiting the command interpreter.  Note that the -e and
       -feet options are mutually exclusive.

       The fsname argument represents the mounted name (for exam-
       ple, root, usr, and so on) of the filesystem being copied.

       The srcdevice or destdevice should be the  disk  partition
       or tape (for example, /dev/rdsk/1s5, /dev/rmt/c0s0, and so
       on).

       The volname is the physical volume name.  Such label names
       contain up to six characters.  volname may be ``-'' to use
       the existing volume name.

                                                                1

volcopy_sfs(1M)                                   volcopy_sfs(1M)

       srcdevice and volname1 are  the  device  and  volume  from
       which  the  copy  of  the  filesystem  is being extracted.
       destdevice and volname2 are the target device and  volume.

       fsname and volname are recorded in the superblock.

       When  copying  from disk to tape, volcopy saves the system
       name and the size and creation date  of  the  LTDB.   When
       copying  from tape to disk, volcopy issues warnings if the
       system name does not match or the  LTDB  has  changed.   A
       positive response is required to continue processing after
       a warning is issued.

       The following security  warnings  may  be  displayed  when
       restoring a file system from tape:

       UX:volcopy:WARN:  System name name of creating system does
       not match system name name of destination system.   Unless
       the  two  systems  have  identical  user, group, and level
       databases, security attributes of the restored files  will
       be  invalid.   Only  use  volcopy to transfer file systems
       between systems if the security databases of the two  sys-
       tems are identical.

       UX:volcopy:WARN:System  is single level, archive is multi-
       level.  This indicates MAC is not installed on the current
       system,  but  was  installed on the system when the backup
       was done.  The  system  ignores  levels  of  the  restored
       files, and access is limited only by DAC.

       volcopy  does  not  support tape-to-tape copying.  Use for
       tape-to-tape copying.
