       Without options, the bkstatus command displays the  status
       of  backup operations that are in progress: either active,
       pending, waiting or suspended.   When  used  with  the  -a
       option,  the  backup command includes failed and completed
       backup operations in the display.

       bkstatus -p defines the amount of status information  that
       is saved for display.

       bkstatus may only be executed by a privileged user.

       Each  backup  operation goes through a number of states as
       described below.  The  keyletters  listed  in  parentheses
       after  each  state  are  used  with the -s option and also
       appear on the display.  backup has been  invoked  and  the
       operations  in  the  backup register for the specified day
       are scheduled to occur.  The  backup  operation  has  been
       assigned  a  destination device and archiving is currently
       underway; or a suspended backup  has  been  resumed.   The
       backup operation is waiting for operator interaction, such
       as inserting the correct volume.  The backup operation has
       been  suspended by an invocation of backup -S.  The backup
       operation failed or has been canceled.  The backup  opera-
       tion has completed successfully.

       Include failed and completed backup operations in the dis-
       play.  All backup operations that have occurred within the
       rotation period are displayed.

       The  -a and -s options are mutually exclusive.  Suppresses
       field wrap on the display and specifies  an  output  field
       separator  to  be  used.   The value of c is the character
       that will appear as the field  separator  on  the  display
       output.   For  clarity  of  output, do not use a separator
       character that is likely to occur in a field.   For  exam-
       ple,  do  not use the colon as a field separator character
       if the display will contain dates that use a colon to sep-
       arate  hours from minutes.  To use the default field sepa-
       rator (tab), specify the null character ("") for c.   Sup-
       press  header on the display.  Restrict the display to the
       specified list of backup job ids  (either  comma-separated
       or  blank-separated  and enclosed in quotes).  [See Define
       the amount of backup status information that is saved  and
       made  available for display as period.  period is the num-
       ber of weeks that information  is  saved  in  /bkup/bksta-

       of weeks specified in period is deleted  from  the  status
       table.   The  minimum valid entry is 1.  The maximum valid
       entry is 52.  The default is 1 week.  Restrict the  report
       to backup operations with the specified states.  states is
       a list of state key-letters (concatenated, comma-separated
       or  blank-separated  and surrounded by quotes).  For exam-
       ple, apf a,p,f "a p f"

       all specify that the report  should  only  include  backup
       operations that are active, pending or failed.

       The  -a  and  -s options are mutually exclusive.  Restrict
       the display to backup operations started by the  specified
       list  of  users (either comma-separated or blank-separated
       and enclosed in quotes).  users  must  be  in  the  passwd
       file.

       The exit codes for the bkstatus command are the following:
       The task completed successfully.  One or  more  parameters
       to  bkstatus  are  invalid.   An  error has occurred which
       caused bkstatus to fail to complete all  portions  of  its
       task.

       Example  1:  bkstatus  -p  4  specifies that backup status
       information is to be saved for  four  weeks.   Any  status
       information older than four weeks is deleted from the sys-
       tem.

       Example 2: bkstatus -a  -j  back-459,back-395  produces  a
       display  that  shows status for the two backup jobs speci-
       fied, even if they have completed or failed.

       Example 3: bkstatus -s a,c -u  "oper3  oper4"  produces  a
       display  that shows only those backup jobs issued by users
       oper3 and oper4 that have a status  of  either  active  or
       completed.
