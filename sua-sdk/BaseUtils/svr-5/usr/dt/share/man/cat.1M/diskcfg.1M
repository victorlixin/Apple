       diskcfg  generates  system  files  for  the Storage Device
       Interface (SDI) drivers  from  information  provided.   It
       reads  input  from  the  provided file, or from stdin if a
       file is not provided, and generates a new  SDI  configura-
       tion   based  on  the  information.   The  input  provided
       describes the SDI drivers to be turned  on  and  off,  and
       must  exactly  match  the  required format or diskcfg will
       fail.  diskcfg is intended for use with the command or any
       command producing similar output.

   OOppttiioonnss
       diskcfg  takes  the  following options: turns on the debug
       messages uses this value instead of / for the  root  of  a
       kernel  source  tree  read  input from filename instead of
       from standard input

   IInnppuutt
       The format of the input for diskcfg is: driver  name  long
       driver  name  driver  type  configure flag unit number dma
       channel 1 dma channel 2 ipl level interrupt vector  inter-
       rupt  sharing flag starting I/O address ending I/O address
       starting memory address ending memory address cpu binding

       Each field must have a value present, and the  input  must
       be  tab  separated.   Each  input  line represents one SDI
       device.

       Note that diskcfg does not use  the  shell  variable  ROOT
       from  the  user environment as its starting path.  You can
       specify a value for ROOT by using the -R option.   The  -R
       option  should  not be used except for the special case of
       kernel development in a non-root source tree.

UUssaaggee
       diskcfg is an administrative command and must  be  run  in
       single-user  mode.   See  for information on switching the
       machine to single-user mode.

       Any loadable target drivers, such as must be demand loaded
       before  executing diskcfg.  See for information on loading
       loadable drivers.
