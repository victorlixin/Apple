       The  enable command activates the named printers, enabling
       them to print requests submitted by the  lp  command.   If
       the  printer  is  remote, the command will only enable the
       transfer of requests to the remote system; the enable com-
       mand  must be run again, on the remote system, to activate
       the printer.  (Run lpstat -p to get the status  of  print-
       ers.)

       When changes are made to the attributes of a print device,
       they are recognized by enable.  Therefore  to  change  the
       definition  or  allocation  for a device, you must disable
       the printer on that device, change the  device,  and  then
       run  enable.  The new device attributes will become effec-
       tive when enable is executed.

       The disable command deactivates the named  printers,  dis-
       abling  them  from  printing requests submitted by lp.  By
       default, any requests that are currently printing  on  the
       designated  printers  will  be reprinted in their entirety
       either on the same printer or on  another  member  of  the
       same  class  of  printers.  If the printer is remote, this
       command will only stop the transmission  of  jobs  to  the
       remote  system.   The  disable  command must be run on the
       remote system to disable the printer.  (Run lpstat  -p  to
       get  the  status of printers.)  disable recognizes supple-
       mentary code set characters in the reason given to the  -r
       option  (see  below)  according to the locale specified in
       the LC_CTYPE environment variable [see LANG on Cancel  any
       requests  that are currently printing on any of the desig-
       nated printers.  This option cannot be used  with  the  -W
       option.   If  the printer is remote, the -c option will be
       silently ignored.  Assign a reason for  the  disabling  of
       the  printers.  This reason applies to all printers speci-
       fied.  This reason is reported by lpstat -p.   reason  may
       contain  supplementary  code  set  characters, and must be
       enclosed in quotes if it  contains  blanks.   The  default
       reason  is  ``unknown  reason'' for existing printers, and
       ``new printer'' for printers just added to the system  but
       not  yet  enabled.  Wait until the request currently being
       printed  is  finished  before  disabling   the   specified
       printer.

       This  option  cannot  be  used with the -c option.  If the
       printer is remote, the -W option will be silently ignored.
