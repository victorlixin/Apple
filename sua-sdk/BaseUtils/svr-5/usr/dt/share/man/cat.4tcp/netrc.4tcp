       The  .netrc  file contains data for logging in to a remote
       host over the network for  file  transfers  by  This  file
       resides in the user's home directory on the machine initi-
       ating the file transfer.  Its permissions should be set to
       disallow read access by group and others (see

       The  following  tokens  are recognized.  They may be sepa-
       rated by space, tab or newline characters: Supply an addi-
       tional  account  password.   If this token is present, the
       auto-login process will supply the specified string if the
       remote  server requires an additional account password, or
       the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it
       does  not.   This  is the same as machine name except that
       default matches any name.  There can be only  one  default
       token,  and  it must be after all machine tokens.  This is
       normally  used  as:  default  login   anonymous   password
       user@site  which  gives  the  user automatic anonymous ftp
       login to machines not specified in .netrc.   This  can  be
       overridden  by using the -n option to ftp to disable auto-
       login.  Identify a user on the remote  machine.   If  this
       token  is  present, the auto-login process will initiate a
       login using the specified name.   Define  a  macro.   This
       functions  in  the  same way as the ftp macdef command.  A
       macro is defined with the  specified  name.  Its  contents
       begin with the next null line (consecutive newline charac-
       ters) is encountered.  If a macro named init  is  defined,
       it is automatically executed as the last step in the auto-
       login process.  Identify a remote machine name.  The auto-
       login process searches the .netrc file for a machine token
       that matches the remote machine specified on the ftp  com-
       mand line or as an open command argument.  Once a match is
       made, the subsequent is reached or another  machine  token
       is encountered.  Supply a password.  If this token is pre-
       sent, the auto-login process  will  supply  the  specified
       string if the remote server requires a password as part of
       the login process.  Note that, if this token is present in
       the  .netrc file, ftp will abort the auto-login process if
       the
