       The  default configuration file for the Address Allocation
       Server (AAS) is /etc/inet/aasd.conf.  The file has a text-
       based, line-oriented format, and is composed of lines con-
       taining keyword-value pairs that  set  server  parameters,
       and address pool definitions.

       Each  line  of the configuration file must be no more than
       1023 characters in length, including the  newline  charac-
       ter.  There is no facility for line continuation.

       Spaces  or tabs are required between lexical elements, and
       may be used at the beginning and end of lines arbitrarily.
       Blank lines may appear anywhere.

       Comments  are denoted by a # preceded by a space or tab or
       the beginning of a line.  Everything from the # to the end
       of the line is ignored.

       The  Address  Allocation Server supports several operating
       parameters that can be set in the configuration file using
       keyword-value  pairs.   The defined keywords are described
       below.  Absolute  path  Directory  in  which  the  address
       server  stores  and looks for the live database file.  The
       size in bytes at which the server will automatically  com-
       press  the database. The value must be an integer, option-
       ally followed by k or K to multiply by 1024, or m  orM  to
       multiply  by  1048576.   An absolute pathname that defines
       the directory in which the server stores checkpoint files.
       The  interval  in  seconds  between checkpoints. The value
       must be an integer.  The number of most recent  checkpoint
       files to save.  Password used for authentication on a net-
       work connection.  There can be  any  number  of  passwords
       defined, each of which is a valid password. The value must
       be a string, an must not contain any quote marks.

       The pool keyword defines an address pool with name name of
       type  address_type.   Currently,  the  Address  Allocation
       Server only  supports  the  INET  address  type  for  IPv4
       addresses.   Each  pool can define individual addresses or
       address ranges separated by spaces or  tabs.   An  address
       range  is  specified  by two addresses separated by only a
       dash (no spaces or tabs).

                                                                1

       The following is an example  pool  definition:  pool  sub-
       net35:INET       {       152.122.35.48       152.122.35.60
