       The  default  configuration  file  for  the DHCP server is
       /etc/inet/dhcpd.conf. It uses a text-based,  line-oriented
       format, and contains one or more entries that contain set-
       tings for various parameters.

       Each line of the DHCP configuration file must be  no  more
       than  1023  characters  in  length,  including the newline
       character.  There is no facility for line continuation.

       Spaces or tabs are required between lexical elements,  and
       may be used at the beginning and end of lines arbitrarily.
       Blank lines may appear anywhere.

       Comments are denoted by a # preceded by a space or tab  or
       the beginning of a line.  Everything from the # to the end
       of the line is ignored.

       All IP addresses can be specified as in ``dotted decimal''
       notation or as a host name (which must be resolvable).

       Integer  values  must  be  base  decimal. Depending on the
       parameter, the value may be signed or  unsigned,  and  may
       have  range  restrictions based on the size of the integer
       or other constraints.

                                                                2

       String values must be specified as a number of ASCII char-
       acters which can include tabs or spaces.

       The  various  definition  types  shown in the ``Synopsis''
       section have different sets  of  allowable  parameters  as
       described  below.   This  entry  allows  you to define new
       global option types.  Outside the scope  of  vendor  class
       definitions,  an option type with a given code may only be
       defined once in the file and it may not redefine an exist-
       ing option.

       You  can also define vendor-specific options within vendor
       class definitions.  Such definitions may redefine existing
       options.  (See the description of vendor_class.)

       Allowed  keywords  are: Defines a comment.  Identifies the
       option but it is not used by the DHCP  server.   Specifies
       whether  the  option's value is integer, binary or string.
       The array modifier indicates that the option's value is an
       array.

       For integer types, the min_val and max_val keywords can be
       used to specify the minimum  and  maximum  values  of  the
       option's value.

       For string and binary types, the max_length and max_length
       keywords can be used to specify the  minimum  and  maximum
       length of the option's value.  For array types, these key-
       words specify the minimum and maximum size of  the  array.
       A  client  entry defines an individual client as described
       in RFC 2131.

       If the opaque keyword is defined,  the  client  identifier
       object  is  treated as an opaque object and is stored as a
       character string.

       If opaque is not defined, a hardware type and  a  hardware
       address  are  expected.   The  hardware  type is validated
       against the server's list of valid hardware types.  If  it
       does not match an existing hardware type, it will be added
       to the list if its value is numeric.  If it does match  an
       existing  type, the length of the hardware address will be
       checked against the  expected  length  for  that  hardware
       type.

       Allowed  keywords  are:  Defines a comment.  Defines an IP
       address for a particular client.  The address must not  be
       included  in  any address pool.  The address will be allo-
       cated with an infinite lease.  Option values for a  client
       can be assigned within the scope of the client definition.
       This entry defines options for a particular user class.

       Allowed keywords are: Defines a  comment.   Option  values

                                                                3

dhcpd.conf(4tcp)                                 dhcpd.conf(4tcp)

       for  a  user class can be assigned within the scope of the
       user class definition.  This entry defines options  for  a
       particular  vendor class.  The vendor-class string is spe-
       cific to a given hardware vendor.

       Allowed keywords are: Defines a comment.   Vendor-specific
       options  can  be  defined  for  each  vendor class.  These
       options can be defined for option  codes  1-254  and  take
       precedence  over  the standard options within the scope of
       the vendor class definition.

       Option values for a vendor class can  be  assigned  within
       the  scope  of  the  vendor  class definition.  This entry
       defines options for a particular subnet.

       Allowed keywords are: Defines a comment.  Defines the sub-
       net  netmask.   Restricts the operation of the server to a
       specified pool of addresses.  Defines  the  default  lease
       period  in days for the subnet.  A value of infinite means
       that there is no limit.  Defines the maximum lease  period
       in  days  for  the subnet.  A value of infinite means that
       there is no limit.  Defines  the  lease  renewal  time  in
       units of 0.1%.  For example, a value of 500 indicates that
       the lease should be renewed after 50%  of  its  lease  had
       expired.   Defines  the  rebind  time  in  units  of 0.1%.
       Option values for a subnet  can  be  assigned  within  the
       scope  of  the  subnet  definition.   This  entry  defines
       options for any address.  Only one  of  these  entries  is
       allowed in the dhcpd.conf file.

       Global  option  values  are  assigned  here.   This  entry
       defines options that affect  the  operation  of  the  DHCP
       server.    Only   one  server  entry  is  allowed  in  the
       dhcpd.conf file.

       Allowed keywords  are:  Defines  the  IP  address  of  the
       Address  Allocation  Server (AAS).  Defines a password for
       the AAS server.  A password must be  defined  if  the  AAS
       server  is  on  a  remote machine.  Defines whether option
       overloading is allowed. If its value is  non-zero,  it  is
       allowed.  By  default it is not allowed.  Defines the ini-
       tial lease reservation time in seconds.  The default value
       is  180  seconds.   Defines the lease padding. This is the
       amount of extra time the server allocates above the client
       lease  time.  It is defined in units of 0.1% of the client
       lease time.  The default value of 10 adds 1% to the client
       lease  time for the server lease time.  Defines whether an
       address that is about to be  allocated  should  be  tested
       using ping.  By default, this is enabled.

       Standard  options supported by the DHCP server are defined
       in RFC 2132. Keywords for these options are defined in the
       file  /etc/inet/dhcp.opts.   User-defined options are also

                                                                4

       supported. These must be defined using  the  option  entry
       type before they are referenced.
