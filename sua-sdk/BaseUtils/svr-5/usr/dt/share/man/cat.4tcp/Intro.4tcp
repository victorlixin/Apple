       This  section  describes  files  used  for  configuration.
       Most of these files are located in the /etc/inet directory
       hierarchy.   Files  such as inetd.conf and hosts, are also
       symbolically linked from /etc for backwards compatibility.
       Some  other  configuration files, such as resolv.conf, are
       expected to be located in /etc.
