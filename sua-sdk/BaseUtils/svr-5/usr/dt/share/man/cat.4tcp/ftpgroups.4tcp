       If  private yes is specified in the file, the group access
       file  (/etc/ftpgroups)  specifies  real  group  name   and
       encrypted  password  associated  with each group name that
       can be used for enhanced access.

       access_group_name:encrypted_password:real_group_name    An
       arbitrary  (alphanumeric  and  punctuation)  string.   The
       group  password  encrypted exactly as in /etc/shadow.  The
