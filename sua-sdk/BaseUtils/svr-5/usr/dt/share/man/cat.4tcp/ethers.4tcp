       The  ethers  file contains information regarding the known
       (48 bit) Ethernet addresses of hosts on the Internet. This
       information  is  used by the RARP daemon, For each host on
       an Ethernet, a single line should be present with the fol-
       lowing  information:  Ethernet-address  official-host-name
       Items are separated by any  number  of  SPACE  and/or  TAB
       characters.   A  #  indicates  the  beginning of a comment
       extending to the end of line.

       The standard form for Ethernet addresses  is  x:x:x:x:x:x,
       where  x  is a hexadecimal number between 0 and FF, repre-
       senting one byte. The address bytes are always in  network
       order.  Host  names  may  contain  any printable character
       other than a SPACE, TAB, NEWLINE, or comment character. It
       is  intended that host names in the ethers file correspond
       to the host names in the file.
