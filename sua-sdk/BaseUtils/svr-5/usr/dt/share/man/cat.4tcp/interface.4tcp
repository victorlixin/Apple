       The  /etc/confnet.d/inet/interface  file  is used to store
       network interface parameters that are used at  boot  time.
       Each  line  of  data in the interface file contains enough
       information to configure an  IP  transport  provider.   At
       boot time, this information is passed to and by the script
       /etc/confnet.d/inet/config.boot.sh.

       The interface file is maintained by running The format  of
       the  lines  in the interface file is a collection of colon
       (:) separated  fields.   prefix:unit:address:device:ifcon-
       fig_opts:slink_opts  Each  field and its defaults (if any)
       are defined as follows: Is an identifier  for  a  driver's
       netstat  (see statistics.  Traditionally this value corre-
       sponds to the common name used for  a  particular  device.
       This  field  cannot be null and it has no default.  Is the
       index per prefix type in the IP  internal  netstat  array,
       where  zero  is  the  first  element's  index.  This field
       should consist of only 0-9.  This field cannot be null and
       it  has no default.  Is used by ifconfig to initialize the
       transport provider.  This may be the  Internet  name  from
       /etc/hosts  (see  or  an  address in Internet standard dot
       notation.   Null  is  expanded  to  the  system  nodename,
       obtained by searching /etc/hosts for the /usr/bin/uname -n
       entry.  The system nodename should be used  for  only  one
       interface  line.  Is the device node name of the transport
       provider.  It is allocated from available network  devices
       listed  in  /etc/confnet.d/netdrivers  (see  through  This
       field cannot be null and it has no default.   Is  used  to
       customize  the  ifconfig options used at boot time and may
       contain any options defined on

       The constructed command line takes the form: ifconfig pre-
       fixunit converted_address ifconfig_opts up The meanings of
       the arguments to ifconfig are as follows:  The  concatena-
       tion of prefix and unit.  prefixunit result may be used as
       the interface parameter given  to  ifconfig  and  netstat.
       The  /etc/hosts  value for the address field.  This can be
       null and has no default, but it is  traditionally  set  to
       -trailers (needed by transport providers).  See and ifcon-
       fig_opts is null when the transport provider is lo (local-
       host  in  /etc/hosts).   localhost  requires no additional
       ifconfig  options  at  boot  time.   slink_opts  and   the
       /etc/strcf  file  (see are used by slink to initialize the
       device into the TCP/IP protocol stack.  slink_opts defines
       the strcf function and its first arguments (it is not lim-
       ited  to  one  word).   add_interface   is   the   default
       slink_opts  value.   Additional arguments will be appended
       to slink_opts to make the final form of the  slink  opera-
       tion:  slink_opts  ip device prefixunit ip is an open file
       descriptor to  /dev/ip,  and  device  and  prefixunit  are
       defined  in  the  current interface entry.  For a standard

       The         entry:        lo:0:localhost:/dev/loop:netmask
       0xff000000:add_loop   from   /etc/confnet.d/inet/interface
       generates   the  following  line  to  be  used  by  slink:
       slink_opts ip device  prefixunit  The  following  ifconfig
       command  would  also  be generated for boot time: ifconfig
       lo0 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 up Note that the  netmask
       arguments  are  present only for the purpose of this exam-
       ple.
