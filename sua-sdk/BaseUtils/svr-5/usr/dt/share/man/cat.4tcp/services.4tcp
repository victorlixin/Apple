       The  services  file  contains  an  entry  for each service
       available through the DARPA Internet.

       Corresponding NIS map containing Internet  services  known
       to  your network.  The service name is the key in the map.

       The services file is used to initialize commands and  pro-
       tocols  with  reserved values.  Each entry in the services
       file  consists  of  a  line  of  the  form:   service-name
       port/protocol aliases

       Fields  must  be  separated by white space.  A # indicates
       the beginning of a comment; characters appearing after the
       # are ignored.

       The  meanings  of  the  fields are as follows: This is the
       official Internet service name.  Service names may contain
       any printable character other than a field delimiter, new-
       line, or comment character.  This field is composed of the
       port number and protocol through which the service is pro-
       vided (for example,  ``512/tcp'').   This  is  a  list  of
       alternate names by which the service might be requested.

       When  the  Network Information Service (NIS) is in use, it
       references the NIS map services.byname on the  NIS  server
       instead of /etc/services.
