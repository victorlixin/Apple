       protocols:  Password  Authentication  Protocol  (PAP)  and
       Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol  (CHAP).   The
       /etc/pppauth  file  holds  the  authentication information
       used by both  of  these  protocols  since  both  protocols
       extract this information from the same format.

       The  authentication  protocol  used is selectable on a PPP
       link basis through the link configuration entries  in  the
       /etc/ppphosts  file.   The local host requires authentica-
       tion on a link and uses PAP  if  the  auth  authentication
       option  is  set  to  pap  for  that  link.  The local host
       requires authentication on a link and  uses  CHAP  if  the
       auth  authentication  option is set to chap for that link.
       If neither pap nor chap is specified for a link, the local
       host  does not require authentication on that link.  Addi-
       tionally, each link configuration may specify an authenti-
       cation  timeout  value  and  may  specify the entry in the
       /etc/pppauth file to use for a local host lookup.

       is either a name for the local host or a name for  a  peer
       host.  For  a peer this is often, but not necessarily, the
       peer's host name.  More than one entry may exist  for  the
       local  host.   For  example,  a  different local host name
       password pair may exist for use with each remote host  for
       which   authentication   will   occur.    The   entry   in
       /etc/pppauth to use for the local host is selectable on  a
       PPP  link  basis through the name authentication parameter
       in the /etc/ppphosts file.  If no entry is specified but a
       local  host lookup is required, the entry beginning with a
       * is used for the local host by default.

       For PAP, this field corresponds with the Peer-ID field  of
       a  PAP  Authentication-Request  message.   For  CHAP, this
       field corresponds with the Name field of a CHAP  Challenge
       or  Response  message.   is  a value that must be known by
       both hosts in the  PPP  authentication  negotiation.   For
       PAP,  this  field corresponds with the Password field of a
       PAP Authentication-Request message.  For CHAP, this  field
       is  the  ``secret''  used  to compute the Value field of a
       CHAP Response message.

       Each entry must be a  single  line  in  the  format  shown
       above.  Each entry can contain up to 2048 characters.  A #
       indicates the beginning of a comment; characters appearing
       after  # are ignored.  Fields are separated by white space
       or a tab.

                                                                1

       and password elements that identify the  remote  host  for
       comparison with those stored in /etc/pppauth.  If the com-
       parison done by pppd does not return a match, pppd refuses
       the  connection  request.  If the remote host requests PAP
       authentication, pppd sends the elements that identify  the
       local  host.   If  PAP is used, these elements are sent as
       is, without encryption, and are therefore not very secure.

       An entry must exist for the local host if any remote hosts
       will request authentication.  An entry must exist for  any
       remote  hosts for whom the local host will request authen-
       tication.

   HHooww CCHHAAPP wwoorrkkss
       If CHAP is specified, pppd, during the PPP  authentication
       negotiation  stage, will send a CHAP request packet to the
       remote host.  The CHAP request packet contains  the  local
       host name and a random string generated by the local host.
       The remote host computes a result  based  on  the  request
       packet  id,  the  random string, and the secret (password)
       value associated with the received (i.e. local host) name.
       The  remote  host sends the result to the local host.  The
       local host performs the same computation using the  secret
       value  for  the local host found in its /etc/pppauth file.
       The local host compares its computation  result  with  the
       result sent by the remote host.  If the results match, the
       local host continues the establishment of  the  connection
       with  the  remote  host;  if the results do not match, the
       local host refuses  the  connection.   If  a  remote  host
       requests  CHAP  authentication, the local host responds as
       described above for a remote host.  Because of the  compu-
       tation  method used by CHAP, it provides a higher level of
       security than PAP.

       An entry must exist for the local host if the  local  host
       will  request authentication.  An entry must exist for any
       remote hosts that will request authentication.
