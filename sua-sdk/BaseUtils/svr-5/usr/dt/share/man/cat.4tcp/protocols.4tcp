       The  protocols  file  contains  information  regarding the
       known protocols used in the DARPA Internet.

   FFiilleess
       Corresponding NIS map containing network  protocols  known
       to your network.  The protocol name is the key in the map.
       Same as protocols.byname, except key  is  protocol  number
       instead of protocol name.

       The protocols file is used to initialize commands and pro-
       tocols with reserved values.

       For each protocol a single line should be present with the
       following  information:  official-protocol-name  protocol-
       number aliases

       Items are separated by any number  of  blanks  and/or  tab
       characters.   A  #  indicates  the beginning of a comment;
       characters appearing after the # are ignored.

       Protocol names may contain any printable  character  other
       than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.

       When  the  Network Information Service (NIS) is in use, it
       references  the  NIS  maps  protocols.byname   or   proto-
       cols.bynumber on the NIS server instead of /etc/protocols.

       A name server should be used instead of a static file.   A
       binary  indexed  file  format should be available for fast
       access.
