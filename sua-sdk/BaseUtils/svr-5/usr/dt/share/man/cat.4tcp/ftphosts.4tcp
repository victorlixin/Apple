       The  ftphosts file is used to allow or deny access to cer-
       tain accounts from various hosts.  The  following  acccess
       capabilities  may  be  defined:  Permit  users to login as
       username  only  from  hosts  matching  addrglob  but  from
       nowhere  else.   Prevent users from logging in as username
       from hosts matching addrglob.  A username of anonymous  or
       ftp specifies the anonymous user.  A username of * matches
       any user.

       addrglob is a  regular  expression  that  can  be  matched
       against hostnames or IP addresses.

       The  first allow or deny line that matches a host is used.
       For  example:  deny     ftp      *.mynet.com  allow    ftp
       nile.rivers.mynet.com would deny access to the ftp account
       from all hosts in the domain mynet.com. The allow line for
       access from nile.rivers.mynet.com would be not be reached.

       To allow access from nile.rivers.mynet.com, the statements
       should  be  placed  in  the  following  order: allow   ftp
       nile.rivers.mynet.com deny    ftp      *.mynet.com  If  no
       entry exists for a user, access is allowed.
