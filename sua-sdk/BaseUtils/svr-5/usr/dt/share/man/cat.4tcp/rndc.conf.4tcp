       This command allows the system  administrator  to  control
       the operation of a name server.  It supersedes the utility
       that was provided  in  old  BIND  releases.   If  rndc  is
       invoked  with  no  command  line  options or arguments, it
       prints a short summary of the supported commands  and  the
       available options and their arguments.

       rndc  communicates with the name server over a TCP connec-
       tion, sending commands authenticated with  digital  signa-
       tures.   In the current versions of rndc and the only sup-
       ported encryption algorithm  is  HMAC-MD5,  which  uses  a
       shared  secret  on  each end of the connection.  This pro-
       vides TSIG-style authentication for  the  command  request
       and  the  name  server's response.  All commands sent over
       the channel must be  signed  by  a  key_id  known  to  the
       server.

       rndc  reads its default configuration file, /etc/rndc.conf
       to determine how to contact the  name  server  and  decide
       what  algorithm and keys is should use.  The -c option can
       be used to specify an alternate configuration file.

       server is the name or address of the server which  matches
       a  server  statement  in the configuration file for rndc .
       If no server is supplied on the  command  line,  the  host
       named by the default-server clause in the option statement
       of the configuration file will be used.

       The -p option can be used to make rndc  send  commands  to
       TCP  port  number  port#  on  the  system running the name
       server instead of BIND 9's default control channel port of
       953.

       The  -y  option identifies the key_id to use from the con-
       figuration file.  key_id must be known by  with  the  same
       algorithm  and  secret string in order for control message
       validation to succeed.  If no -y option is provided,  rndc
       will  first  look for a key clause in the server statement
       of the server being used, or if  no  server  statement  is
       present  for that host, then the default-key clause of the
       options statement.  Note that the configuration  file  for
       rdnc  contains  shared  secrets  which  are  used  to send
       authenticated control commands to name servers.  It should
       therefore not have general read or write access.

       The  -M, -m, and -v options provided debugging information
       and are primarily of interest only to the BIND 9  develop-
       ers.  They might be changed or removed in future releases.

                                                                1

       rndc does not yet support all the commands of the  BIND  8
       utility.

       There is currently no way to provide the shared secret for
       a key_id without using the configuration file.

       Several error messages could  be  clearer.   For  example,
       trying  to connect from an address that is not in the list
       of acceptable addresses configured into will result in the
       error  message  "end  of file" when the server unceremoni-
       ously closes the connection.
