       named is a Domain Name System (DNS) server,  part  of  the
       BIND 9 distribution from ISC.  For more information on the
       DNS, see RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035.  On &ou8; systems, the
       named daemon is located in the file /usr/sbin/in.named.

       When  invoked  without  arguments,  named  will  read  the
       default configuration file /etc/named.conf , read any ini-
       tial data, and listen for queries.

       The  options  to  named are as follows: use config-file as
       the   configuration   file   instead   of   the   default,
       /etc/named.conf .  To ensure that reloading the configura-
       tion file continues to work after the server  has  changed
       its  working  directory  due  to  to  a possible directory
       option in the configuration file, config-file should be an
       absolute  pathname.  set the daemon's debug level to debu-
       glevel .  Debugging traces from named become more  verbose
       as  the  debug  level  increases.   run named in the fore-
       ground.  run named in the foreground and force all logging
       to stderr .  create #cpus worker threads to take advantage
       of multiple CPUs.  If no option is given, named  will  try
       to  determine  the  number  of CPUs present and create one
       thread per CPU.  If named is unable to determine the  num-
       ber  of  CPUs,  a single worker thread is created.  listen
       for queries on  port port# instead  of  the  default  port
       number,  53.   write  memory usage statistics to stdout on
       exit.  This option is mainly of interest to BIND9 develop-
       ers  and  may  be  removed or changed in a future release.
       tells named to chroot()  to  directory  immediately  after
       reading  its config file.  This should be used in conjunc-
       tion with the -u option, as chrooting a process running as
       root  doesn't  enhance  security on most systems - the way
       chroot() is defined allows a process with root  privileges
       to  escape  the  chroot  jail.  run named as UID user-id .
       named will change its UID after it  has  carried  out  any
       privileged  operations, such as creating sockets that lis-
       ten on privileged ports.

       On Linux, named uses the kernel's capability mechanism  to
       drop all root privileges except the ability to bind() to a
       privileged port.  Unfortunately, this means that the  "-u"
       option  only  works  when  named  is run on 2.3.99-pre3 or
       later kernel, since previous kernels did not allow  privi-
       leges  to  be retained after setuid().  report the version
       number and exit.  load data from cache-file  .   into  the
       cache  of the default view.  This option must not be used.
       It is only of interest to  BIND9  developers  and  may  be
       removed or changed in a future release.

                                                                1

       In  routine  operation, signals should not be used to con-
       trol the name server.  rndc should be used instead.  Send-
       ing the name server a SIGHUP signal forces a reload of the
       server.  A SIGINT or SIGTERM signal can be used to  grace-
       fully  shut down the server.  Sending any other signals to
       the name server will have an undefined outcome.
