       The  /etc/lmhosts file contains mappings of  host names to
       IP addresses for use in routed IP networks (that is,  net-
       works where  host systems are located on other IP networks
       accessible via routers). This file  format  is  compatible
       with the Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x
        LMHOSTS file.

       Normally,  the  nbtstat  -R  program loads the contents of
       this file into the   name cache as part of  the    startup
       procedure.

       The IP_address field must be given in dotted decimal nota-
       tion.

       The _name field can contain up to 16 characters that iden-
       tify the remote client or server system and must match the
        name of the remote system. For special applications, rep-
       resent  non-printable  characters  as  hexadecimal  values
       using the notation ``\0xnn'', and enclose the entire field
       in  double  quotes.   Pad the name with blanks to position
       the special character correctly.

       The # character normally delimits the start of  a  comment
       except  when it is used to start an expression of the form
       ``#DOM:domain_name''. This is used to  identify  a  server
       system that is part of a domain or  group.
