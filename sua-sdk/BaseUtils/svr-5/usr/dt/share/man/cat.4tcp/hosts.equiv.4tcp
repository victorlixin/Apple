       The file /etc/hosts is a list of hosts that share the net-
       work, including the local host. It is referred to by  pro-
       grams that need to translate between host names and Inter-
       net addresses when the name server (see is not being used.
       Each  line in the file describes a single host on the net-
       work and consists of three fields separated by any  number
       of  blanks  or  tabs:  address name aliases ...  where The
       Internet address.   Unless  another  type  of  address  is
       required  by some host on the network, address should be a
       Class A address, which takes the form net.node  where  net
       is  the  network number from /etc/networks (see which must
       be between 0 and 127; and node is a value  which  must  be
       unique  for  each host and be between 0 and 16777215.  The
       fully qualified domain name  of  the  host  (for  example,
       grinch.eng.xyz.com).   A  list  of alternate names for the
       host (such as the unqualified node name).  Aliases can  be
       used  in  network commands in place of the node name.  The
       routines which search this file ignore comments  (portions
       of lines beginning with #) and blank lines.

       Internet  addresses can actually take one of four forms: A
       is a simple 32-bit integer.  A is  an  eight-bit  quantity
       occupying  the  high-order byte and B is a 24-bit quantity
       occupying the remaining bytes.  This form is suitable  for
       a Class A address of the form net.node.  A is an eight-bit
       quantity occupying the high-order byte; B is an  eight-bit
       quantity  occupying the next byte; and C is a 16-bit quan-
       tity occupying the remaining bytes.  This form is suitable
       for  a Class B address of the form 128.net.node.  The four
       parts each occupy a byte in the address.
