       The  Internet  services  daemon, inetd, is normally run at
       boot time by the Service  Access  Facility  (SAF).   inetd
       listens  for  connections on the Internet addresses of the
       services specified in its configuration file.  When a con-
       nection  is  found, inetd invokes the server daemon speci-
       fied by that configuration file for the requested service.
       Once  a server process exits, inetd continues to listen on
       the socket.

       Rather than having several daemon processes with  sparsely
       distributed  requests  each  running  concurrently,  inetd
       reduces the  load  on  the  system  by  invoking  Internet
       servers only as they are needed.

       inetd  itself  provides  a number of simple TCP-based ser-
       vices.  These include echo,  discard,  chargen  (character
       generator),   daytime  (human  readable  time),  and  time
       (machine readable time, in the form of the number of  sec-
       onds  since  midnight,  January  1, 1900).  For details of
       these services, consult the  appropriate  RFC,  as  listed
       below, from the Network Information Center.

       When started, inetd reads  its  configuration  information
       from     configuration-file,     the     default     being
       /etc/inetd.conf.  See for more information on  the  format
       of  this file.  inetd rereads its configuration file when-
       ever it receives a hangup signal,  SIGHUP.   New  services
       can  be  activated, and existing services deleted or modi-
       fied in between whenever the file is reread.

       Run inetd  ``stand-alone,''  outside  the  Service  Access
       Facility  (SAF).   When  the  -s option is not used, inetd
       must be run under SAF via the command.  Enable  debugging.
       In  debug  mode,  TCP  connections  will have the SO_DEBUG
       option enabled via setsockopt (see SO_DEBUG is needed  for
       Note  that when -d option is used, inetd runs in the fore-
       ground.  Put inetd into  calltrace  mode,  which  produces
       additional entries.

       inetd  implements  the TCPMUX protocol as described in RFC
       1078: ``A TCP client connects to a  foreign  host  on  TCP
       port 1.  It sends the service name followed by a carriage-
       return line-feed (CR LF).  The service name is never  case

                                                                1

       sensitive.   The  server  replies  with a single character
       indicating positive (+) or  negative  (-)  acknowledgment,
       immediately  followed  by  an optional message of explana-
       tion, terminated with a CR LF.  If the reply was positive,
       the  selected protocol begins; otherwise the connection is
       closed.''  The program is passed  the  TCP  connection  as
       file descriptors 0 and 1.

       If  the  TCPMUX  service  name  begins with a ``+'', inetd
       returns the positive reply for the program.   This  allows
       you  to  invoke  programs  that  use  stdin/stdout without
       putting any special server code in them.

       The special service name ``help'' causes inetd to list the
       TCPMUX services currently configured in /etc/inetd.conf.

       To  have  SAF  start  inetd  if it is not already running:
       sacadm  -s  -p  inetd  You  can  force  inetd  to  re-read
       /etc/inetd.conf  by  sending  it a SIGHUP signal. If inetd
       was started by SAF rather than from the command line,  use
       the following command: kill -HUP `cat /etc/saf/inetd/_pid`
       ALternatively, use the SAF  to  stop  and  restart  inetd:
       sacadm -k -p inetd sacadm -s -p inetd
