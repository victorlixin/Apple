DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The netmasks file contains network masks used to implement
       IP standard subnetting.

FFiilleess
       Corresponding NIS map containing network masks to be  used
       with IP subnetting.  The mask is the key in the map.

UUssaaggee
       For  each  network that is subnetted, a single line should
       exist in this file with the network number, any number of

       or

       characters, and the network mask to use on  that  network.
       Network  numbers and masks may be specified in the conven-
       tional IP ``.'' notation (like IP host addresses, but with
       zeroes for the host part).

       When  the  Network Information Service (NIS) is in use, it
       references the NIS map netmasks.byaddr on the  NIS  server
       instead of /etc/netmasks.

       128.32.0.0 255.255.255.0

       can be used to specify that the Class B network 128.32.0.0
       should have eight bits of subnet field and eight  bits  of
       host  field,  in  addition to the standard sixteen bits in
       the network field.
