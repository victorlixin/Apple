       The  /etc/printcap  file  is  a  simplified version of the
       database used to describe line printers. The spooling sys-
       tem  accesses  the  printcap  file  every time it is used,
       allowing dynamic addition and deletion of printers.   Each
       entry   in  the  database  describes  one  printer.   This
       database may not be substituted for, as  is  possible  for
       termcap, because it may allow accounting to be bypassed.

       More information on configurable options follows: Extended
       rlp protocol support.  The prescence of the ex flag  indi-
       cates  that  the  specific  remote  machine  to  which the
       printer is connected to, will  support  the  extended  RLP
       protocol.   Only  printers  connected  to  systems running
       &everestREL5; and above will support the  extended  proto-
       col.   Maximum  number  of blocks to copy.  The default is
       1000.  This option is used  to  adjust  the  size  of  the
       printjob  (which defaults to 1MB).  Configuration example:
       mx#5000 If mx is  set  to  zero,  then  the  mx  field  is
       ignored.   Maximum  number of copies allowed.  The default
       is 0.  The -n command line option could be used  to  over-
       ride  this  only  if mc is set to 0.  Otherwise, the upper
       limit is set by mc. Configuration example mc#50 Restricted
       group  access.   If non-null, only users who are member of
       the restricted group will  be  allowed  access  to  print.
       Output  filter to use for printing.  For more information,
       see Suppress multiple copies.  Turning on this option will
       override  the  -n  option for lp given on the command line
       for number of copies. This is a flag.  Suppress form  feed
       on  each print job. This is a flag.  Suppress header page.
       This goes in conjunction with the hl option.  With the  hl

                                                                1

       flag  and  without  the  sh  flag  the banner page will be
       printed. This is a flag.  Print header  last.   This  flag
       works  only  in  conjunction  with the sh flag.  If the sh
       flag is not specified then the banner page will be printed
       last.  Page width which is to be passed to the output fil-
       ter.  Configuration example: pw#80 page length which is to
       be  passed  to  the output filter.  Configuration example:
       pl#100 Restrict printing to those with local  accounts  on
       the  machine if this flag is turned on.  If the local line
       printer  driver  supports  indentation,  the  daemon  must
       understand how to invoke it.

       Error  messages  generated  by  the  line printer programs
       themselves (that is, the lp* programs) are logged by using
       the LPR facility. Messages printed on stderr of one of the
       filters are sent to the corresponding lf file. The filters
       may, of course, use syslog themselves.

       Error  messages sent to the console have a carriage return
       and a line feed appended to them, rather than just a  line
       feed.
