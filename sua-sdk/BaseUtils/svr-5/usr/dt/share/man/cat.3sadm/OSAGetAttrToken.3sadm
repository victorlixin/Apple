       These  procedures  allow the C/C++ OSAs to get information
       about the attribute list structure and the attributes con-
       tained in that structure.

       OSAGetAttrCount examines the list provided by the client's
       request (the command line). It returns a count of the num-
       ber of attributes that were given.

       OSAAttrIsPresent returns a boolean TRUE or FALSE depending
       on if the attribute represented by the given  attributeTo-
       ken  is  present  in  the  list  provided  by the client's
       request (the command line).

       OSAGetAttrByIndex returns the attributeToken  representing
       the  attributeIndex'th  attribute  in the list provided by
       the client's request (the command line).

       OSAGetAttrArraySize returns the  size  of  the  set-valued
       attribute's  data  in  the  list  provided by the client's
       request (the command line).

       A pointer  to  the  attribute  list  data  structure.  All
       attribute  values  that provided by the calling client are
       contained in this structure and  are  accessed  via  admin
       services library routines.  The predefined token that rep-
       resents the attribute.  These tokens are  defined  in  the
       OSA's  CDT.   A pointer to the error stack data structure.
       If an error occurs in retrieving the data, the appropriate
       error  will be placed in the error stack. This data can be
       referenced using the library functions associated with the
       error  stack.  An index into the attribute list structure,
       asking for the attributeIndex'th attribute that  is  given
       in the structure. The list starts at zero (0).

       The  attribute  represented by attributeToken was not pro-
       vided by the client in the attributeList.
