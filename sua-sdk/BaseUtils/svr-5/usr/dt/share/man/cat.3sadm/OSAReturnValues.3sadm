       These procedures allow the C/C++ OSAs to return values  to
       the admin services library routine calling them.

       OSAReturnLong  passes the value of a integer number to the
       return list structure and associates it with an attribute.
       If  this  function  is  called  repeatedly on for the same
       attribute in the same return list then the results  depend
       on the associated attribute (represented by the attribute-
       Token); if the attribute is of single-valued type then the
       given integer will replace any previous integer associated
       with the attribute, if the attribute is of set-valued type
       then the given integer will be added to the list of previ-
       ous values associated with  the  attribute,  and  all  the
       integer values given with that attribute will be returned.

       OSAReturnDouble works in an identical manner to OSAReturn-
       Long except it expects a floating point number.

       OSAReturnString works in an identical manner to OSAReturn-
       Long except it expects a pointer to a string.

       OSAReturnBoolean is used while  evaluating  Filter  opera-
       tions.   As filters will only return a true or false, they
       do not need to associate values with  an  attribute.  This
       function  should only be called once for each return list.

       OSAReturnActionData is used while evaluating Action opera-
       tions.   As actions only return raw data, they do not need
       to associate values with an attribute. This  function  can
       be  called  repeatedly, each will create a new string ele-
       ment that will be returned.  Note that OSAReturnActionData
       s  used by the ``list'' execution procedures to return the
       names of objects held by containers.

       All of these procedures copy the data passed  to  them  so

                                                                1

       that  passing  them  volatile  data  will not result in an
       error.

       Unexpected results will occur if one of  these  procedures
       is  called with an attribute of a data type other than its
       own. The programmer should take care  to  call  OSAReturn-
       String() only with attributes of data type of string, etc.

       A pointer to the return list data  structure.  All  return
       values  are  contained  in this structure and are accessed
       and changed via admin services library routines.  The pre-
       defined  token  that represents the attribute to which the
       given value should be associated with.  These  tokens  are
       defined  in  the OSA's CDT.  The value of the integer that
       will be associated with the named attribute.  The value of
       the floating point number that will be associated with the
       named attribute.  The a pointer to the string that will be
       associated  with  the  named attribute or an action opera-
       tion. This data will be copied and stored  by  the  return
       list  data  structure,  so  passing this function volatile
       data is acceptable.  One of the two boolean  values  (TRUE
       or  FALSE) that is to be associated with a filter request.
