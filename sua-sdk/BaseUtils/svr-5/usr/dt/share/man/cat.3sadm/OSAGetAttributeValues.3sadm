       These procedures allow the C/C++ OSAs to get single-valued
       data  from  the  attribute list via admin services library
       routines.

       OSAGetAttributeLong looks for the named attribute  in  the
       attribute  list provided by the client's request (the com-
       mand line). If found then it will return the integer  num-
       ber associated with the named attribute.

       OSAGetAttributeDouble  works  in  an  identical  manner to
       OSAGetAttributeLong except it  returns  a  floating  point
       number.

       OSAGetAttributeString  works  in  an  identical  manner to
       OSAGetAttributeLong except  it  returns  a  pointer  to  a
       string.

       These  functions only work on single-valued attributes. If
       the OSA writer needs to receive set-valued attribute  data
       then the OSAGetAttrArrayValue procedures should be called.

       A pointer to the error stack data structure. If  an  error
       occurs  in retrieving the data, the appropriate error will
       be placed in the error stack. This data can be  referenced
       using  the  library  functions  associated  with the error
       stack.  A pointer to the attribute  list  data  structure.
       All  attribute  values that provided by the calling client
       are contained in this structure and are accessed via admin
       services library routines.  The predefined token that rep-
       resents the attribute to which the given value  should  be
       associated  with.  These  tokens  are defined in the OSA's
       CDT.
