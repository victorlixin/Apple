       These procedures allow the C/C++ OSAs  to  get  set-valued
       data  from  the  attribute list via admin services library
       routines.

       OSAGetAttrArrayLong looks for the named attribute  in  the
       attribute  list provided by the client's request (the com-
       mand line). If found then it will return the arrayIndex'th
       integer number associated with the named attribute.

       OSAGetAttrArrayDouble  works  in  an  identical  manner to
       OSAGetAttrArrayLong except it  returns  a  floating  point
       number.

       OSAGetAttrArrayString  works  in  an  identical  manner to
       OSAGetAttrArrayLong except  it  returns  a  pointer  to  a
       string.

       These  functions  only  work on set-valued attributes.  If
       the OSA writer needs to  receive  single-valued  attribute
       data  then  the  OSAGetAttributeValue procedures should be
       called.

       A pointer to the error stack data structure. If  an  error
       occurs  in retrieving the data, the appropriate error will
       be placed in the error stack. This data can be  referenced
       using  the  library  functions  associated  with the error
       stack.  A pointer to the attribute  list  data  structure.
       All  attribute  values that provided by the calling client
       are contained in this structure and are accessed via admin
       library  routines.   The  predefined token that represents
       the attribute to which the given value should  be  associ-
       ated  with.  These  tokens  are  defined in the OSA's CDT.
       This is an index into the set (or array) of values  to  be
       read  from. Only one value from the array can be read at a
       time.
