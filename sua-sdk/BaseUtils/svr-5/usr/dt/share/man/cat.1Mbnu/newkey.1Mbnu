       The  newkey  command establishes public keys for users and
       privileged users on the network.  These  keys  are  needed
       when using secure RPC.

       newkey  takes  the  following  options:  Create a new pub-
       lic/secret key pair for the privileged user  at  hostname.
       Prompts  for  a  password for hostname.  Create a new pub-
       lic/secret key pair for username.  Prompts for a  password
       for username.

       newkey  is  normally  run  by the RPC administrator on the
       machine that contains the database.

       Firstly, newkey prompts for a  password  for  username  or
       hostname.   Then  it  creates a new public/secret key pair
       for the user or host in /etc/publickey, encrypted with the
       given password.
