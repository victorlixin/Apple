       The  uucico command is the file transport program for work
       file transfers.

       The uucico command takes the following options: The  first
       field in the file is the Type field.  The -c option forces
       uucico to only use entries in the Type  field  that  match
       the  user  specified  type.  The specified type is usually
       the name of a local area network.  This  option  specifies
       the  directory spool_directory that contains the uucp work
       files to be transferred.  The default spool  directory  is
       /var/spool/uucp.   Force execution of uucico.  This option
       can be used to force a connection to a remote system  even
       if  no work files are to be transferred.  The limit on the
       maximum number of uucico processes defined in is  ignored.
       This  option  currently has no effect.  A role_number of 1
       is used for master mode.  A role_number of 0 is  used  for
       slave mode (default).  When uucico is started by a program
       or a role_number of 1 should be used for master mode.  The
       -s  option  defines  the  remote system (system_name) that
       uucico will try to contact.  It is required when the  role
       is  master;  system_name  must be defined in the file.  In
       slave mode, sets the login name to be  looked  up  in  the
       file instead of that of the invoking user.  Both and queue
       jobs that will be transferred by uucico.  These  jobs  are
       normally started by the scheduler, for debugging purposes,
       and can be started manually.  For example, the shell Uutry
       starts  uucico  with debugging turned on.  The debug_level
       is a number between 0 and 9.   Higher  numbers  give  more
       detailed debugging information.
