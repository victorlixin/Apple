       The cs command starts the Connection Server used to estab-
       lish connections for all network services that communicate
       over  TLI connection-oriented and serial connections.  The
       Connection Server is started automatically when the system
       goes  to multi-user mode.  It receives connection requests
       for network services from  client  applications  (via  and
       function  calls),  maps  machine  and  service  names into
       transport-dependent addresses, establishes connections  to
       the  services, authenticates the connections if necessary,
       and passes the connections back to the applications.   The
       Connection  Server  is used by the cu and uucp commands to
       establish network connections.

       The cs command takes the  following  options:  Invoke  the
       Connection Server in debug mode.  If the Connection Server
       is already running, you  must  the  cs  process  and  then
       restart  the  Connection  Server  with the -d option.  The
       debug information  is  written  to  /var/adm/log/cs.debug.
       Set    the    upper    limit    on   the   size   of   the
       /var/adm/log/cs.debug file to debugsize bytes.  When  this
       limit  is  reached,  the  contents of the current cs.debug
       file are moved to cs.debug_old, and subsequent  diagnostic
       information  is  written  to  a  new  cs.debug  file.   By
       default, cs.debug is limited to 400,000  bytes.   Set  the
       upper limit on the size of the /var/adm/log/cs.log file to
       logsize bytes.  When this limit is reached,  the  contents
       of  the  current  cs.log file are moved to cs.log_old, and
       subsequent logging information is written to a new  cs.log
       file.   By  default,  cs.log  is limited to 160,000 bytes.
       Force the Connection Server to reread  the  authentication
       file  /etc/cs/auth.   The  authentication file is normally
       only read when cs is started.  This option must be used if
       the /etc/cs/auth file is updated while cs is running.

       The  Connection  Server  keeps  two logs: cs writes status
       information to this log by default  cs  writes  diagnostic

                                                                1

       information  to  this  log only when invoked in debug mode
       using the -d option Both logs are implemented as  circular
       logs.   That  is,  when  the  size of either log reaches a
       specified   limit,   the   current   log   is   moved   to
       /var/adm/log/cs.log_old  or  to /var/adm/log/cs.debug_old,
       and a new log file is created.   Logging  continues  using
       the new cs.log or cs.debug file.

       To  put the Connection Server into debug mode, the current
       cs process and enter /usr/sbin/cs -d to start the  Connec-
       tion Server in debug mode.

       To  turn  off  the debug mode, kill the current Connection
       Server that is running in debug mode, and restart it  with
       no options.

       To  save  disk  space,  kill the current Connection Server
       process and enter: /usr/sbin/cs -L 20000 This restarts  cs
       using  a cs.log file that will not grow larger than 20,000
       bytes.  Note that, in this example, the combined  size  of
       the  cs.log  file  and the cs.log_old file will not exceed
       40,000 bytes.
