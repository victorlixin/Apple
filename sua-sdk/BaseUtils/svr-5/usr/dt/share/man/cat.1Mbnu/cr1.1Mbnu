       The cr1 scheme executable implements the  cr1  identifica-
       tion  and  authentication  protocol.   The cr1 scheme is a
       bilateral scheme that operates within the framework of the
       Identification and Authentication Facility (IAF).

       cr1  identifies and authenticates users on both the server
       and the client machines at the time a connection is estab-
       lished.   Both  parties in the communication are authenti-
       cated through the use of a key (see The effective  UID  of
       the process running cr1 determines the key that is used in
       the authentication.

       The options to cr1 have the following meanings:  Indicates
       that the scheme will operate in the role of responder.  If
       this option is not specified, the scheme operates  in  the
       role  of imposer.  Indicates the local logname local_user.
       Indicates the local service name local_service.  Indicates
       the remote logname remote_user.  Indicates the remote sys-
       tem remote_machine.  Indicates  the  remote  service  name
       remote_service.

       To  instruct  a  port monitor to use cr1 to protect a ser-
       vice, a cr1 command line must be registered in the  scheme
       field  of the service's entry in the port monitor's _pmtab
       file.  When a remote user attempts to access a service  on
       the  local  system, the port monitor passes the command to
       the function, which executes the program.

       If the -u option is used in the responder  role,  the  cr1
       scheme  attempts  to  use  the key shared by the local and
       remote machines.  If this key  is  not  available  to  the
       application  (or  if no -u option is used), the cr1 scheme
       will attempt to use the key shared by the local  effective
       user and the principal indicated by the -M and -U options.

       The imposer will use the corresponding key shared  by  the
       responder and the local effective user.

       The  options  -u  and -s indicate that the local user name
       and the name of the local service, respectively, are to be
       passed   to  the  remote  machine  in  the  authentication
       exchange.  The -U and -M options instruct cr1 to  use  the
       remote   machine   name   and   the   remote   user  name,

                                                                1

       respectively, to look up keys in its database.

       The cr1 executable program implements  the  cr1  protocol,
       assuming  that  file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 have been set
       to the connection to be authenticated.  The file  descrip-
       tors are set by the invoke library function (see

       Upon  successful completion of an authentication exchange,
       the cr1 program exits with a value  of  0  and  associates
       appropriate  values  with  the  authenticated  connection,
       using the putava and  setava  functions.   The  associated
       values  may then be used by applications using the authen-
       ticated connection, using the getava and retava functions.

       Note  that  by default, cr1 uses DES encryption.  For this
       to work, both machines using authentication must have  the
       Encryption  Utilities  package installed.  If this package
       is not available,  the  machines  can  use  authentication
       using ENIGMA encryption, by invoking cr1 as cr1.enigma.

       If  authentication fails, cr1 exits with a non-zero return
       value and logs a reason or reasons in its log file.
