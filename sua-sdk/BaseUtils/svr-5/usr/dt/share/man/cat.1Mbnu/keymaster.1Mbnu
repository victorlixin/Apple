       The keymaster command starts the cr1 key management daemon
       and sets the master  key  that  is  used  to  encrypt  and
       decrypt the shared keys stored in the keys file (see

       A shared key is a bit string, known only to the parties in
       an exchange, that is used to  authenticate  a  connection.
       When  shared  keys  are entered, they are stored in a keys
       file by a daemon process.  If a  master  key  exists,  the
       shared keys in the file are encrypted.

       When  keymaster  is first entered, it forks a process that
       continues as the key management daemon.

       The options to keymaster are as  follows:  Indicates  that
       the  master key is to be changed.  keymaster first prompts
       the user to enter the old master key, then  a  new  master
       key.  Indicates that the keys file is not encrypted.  key-
       master does not prompt for a master key.   Indicates  that
       the  key  management  daemon  is to be stopped.  No key is
       required to stop the key management daemon.   This  option
       takes  precedence over both -c and -n.  Specifies the name
       of the scheme to be used.   The  default  scheme  is  cr1,
       which  uses  DES encryption, and requires that the Encryp-
       tion Utilities package be installed.  If this  package  is
       not available, ENIGMA encryption can be used by specifying
       cr1.enigma for scheme.

       When no options are specified, keymaster prompts  for  the
       current  master  key.   If  the master key is entered cor-
       rectly, the keymaster daemon is started.

       keymaster does not echo keys as they are typed.   It  con-
       firms  a new master key by requiring the user to enter the
       key a second time.  If the second entry does not match the
       first, the operation is not executed.

       Use  of  keymaster  is  restricted to the privileged user.
       The privileged user is the owner of the keys file.

       keymaster passes a request to the  key  management  daemon
       either  by  becoming the daemon, or by writing to the cur-
       rent daemon's pipe.  If the daemon returns  success,  key-
       master  exits  with  a value of 0; otherwise, it prints an
       error message and exits with a non-zero value.

                                                                1

       Note that, if keymaster successfully starts the  key  man-
       agement  daemon,  it  indicates  success to the user, even
       though the daemon may subsequently fail.
