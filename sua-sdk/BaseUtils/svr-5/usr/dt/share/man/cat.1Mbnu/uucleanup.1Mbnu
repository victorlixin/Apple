       The  uucleanup command scans the spool directories for old
       files and takes appropriate action to  remove  them  in  a
       useful way.

       The  following options are available: Any C. files greater
       than or equal to days days old will be removed with appro-
       priate  information  to  the  requester.  The default is 7
       days.  Any D. files greater than or equal to days days old
       will  be removed.  An attempt will be made to deliver mail
       messages and execute rnews when appropriate.  The  default
       is 7 days.  Any C. files equal to days days old will cause
       a mail message to be sent to the requester  warning  about
       the  delay in contacting the remote.  The message includes
       the job ID, and in the case of  mail,  the  mail  message.
       The  administrator may include a message line telling whom
       to call to check the problem (-m option).  The default  is
       1  day.   Any  X. files greater than or equal to days days
       old will be removed.  The D. files are probably  not  pre-
       sent (if they were, the X. files could get executed).  But
       if there are D. files, they will be taken care  of  by  D.
       processing.   The default is 2 days.  Removes empty direc-
       tories under the PUBDIR directory only if they  are  owned
       by  uucp  (UID=5).   Include string in the warning message
       generated by the -W option.  string may contain supplemen-
       tary  code  set characters.  Other files whose age is more
       than days days will be deleted.  The default  is  2  days.
       The  default  line  is:  See  your  local administrator to
       locate the problem  Execute  for  system  spool  directory
       only.   debug_level  is  a  single  digit between 0 and 9;
       higher numbers give more detailed debugging information.
