       keyserv  is  a daemon that is used for storing the private
       encryption keys of  each  user  logged  into  the  system.
       These  encryption  keys are used for accessing secure net-
       work services such as secure RPC.

       keyserv takes the following options: Disables the  use  of
       default  keys  Used  for  debugging root's key is not read
       from /etc/.rootkey.  Instead, keyserv prompts the user for
       the  password to decrypt root's key stored in the database
       and then stores the decrypted  key  in  /etc/.rootkey  for
       future  use.   This  option is useful if the /etc/.rootkey
       file ever gets out of date or corrupted.

       Normally, root's key is read from the  file  /etc/.rootkey
       when  the daemon is started.  This is useful during power-
       fail reboots when no one is around to type a password.

       To start keyserv manually,  you  must  be  root  with  the
       appropriate privileges.
