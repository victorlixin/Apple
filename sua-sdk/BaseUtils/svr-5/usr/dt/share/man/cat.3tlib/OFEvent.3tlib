       These  routines  can be used to send events from within an
       OSA to the program which is making  an  object  call.  The
       object  call continues executing, but the program is noti-
       fied of the events through a callback which is  registered
       via  The event mechanism is intended as a as an additional
       way for OSAs to communicate information to programs  using
       object  calls,  including  information that cannot be sent
       back as part of an object response or an error  stack.  If
       no  event  handler  is  registered, the events will not be
       sent.

       OFThrowBmipEvent sends an event directly back to the orig-
       inator  of  the  current  object request. OFCatchBmipEvent
       sends an event only if the specified  command  returns  an
       error. The error information is sent as part of the event,
       and execution of the object  request  proceeds  as  if  no
       error had occurred. This routine is intended for notifying
       programs of errors which are not serious  enough  to  halt
       processing.
