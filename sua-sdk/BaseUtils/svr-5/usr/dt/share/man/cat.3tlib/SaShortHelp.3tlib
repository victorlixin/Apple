       SaShortHelp  provides  a  complete interface for graphical
       point help when used in conjunction  with  a  status  bar.
       Point  help,  also referred to as ``short help,'' presents
       the user with short, helpful descriptions of menu options,
       push  buttons,  input fields, lists and other widgets when
       appropriate. Point help may be disabled when the  user  no
       longer finds the text necessary or desirable.

       SaShortHelp must be used with SaStatusBar.  standard point
       help callback. This may passed to  any  number  of  &VTcl;
       widget  calls  and library interfaces that require a point
       help callback. The application must also create  a  status
       bar  on at least the main form using The status bar is the
       graphical display area for point help text.  When invoked,
       SaShortHelpCB can identify the current form dialog, locate
       the status bar  and  display/clear  the  point  help  text
       string.  attach standard point help menu options to speci-
       fied pulldown menu widget.  Currently, this  is  a  single
       menu  item,  a  toggle button for enabling/disabling point
       help: * Point Help enable/disable point  help.  While  the
       application may change state explicitly, this is typically
       done by the user via the short help  menu  options.  State
       changes  made  via the menu options are transparent to the
       application.  determine the current state of  point  help.
       load/store user configurable point help state so that set-
       tings can persist across multiple invocations.  These  use
       the SaScreenPolicy interface.

       SaShortHelpLoad  must  be  performed  before  the  call to
       SaShortHelpMenuOptions so that the menu option toggle but-
       ton  is properly in sync with the actual point help state.

       SaShortHelpStore is typically used  in  the  application's
       exit  function after the user's last opportunity to change
       state.
