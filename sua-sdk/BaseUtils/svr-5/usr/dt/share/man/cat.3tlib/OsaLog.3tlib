       OsaLog provides an interface for logging events  into  the
       admin event log.  Basic events are logged automatically by
       the admin framework depending on  which  event  types  are
       selected by the admin Event Log Manager.  Callers can pro-
       vide additional log information as necessary. This  inter-
       face  is  typically  used  by object service agents (OSA).
       opens an I/O stream to the admin event file for a particu-
       lar  object  class and a particular valid registered event
       type.  closes the I/O stream and flushes the  event  data.
       logs  a  message  for a specific object instance and event
       type.
