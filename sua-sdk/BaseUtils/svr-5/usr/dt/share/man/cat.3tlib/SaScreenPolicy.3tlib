       The SaScreenPolicy interface enables admin applications to
       retain  per-user  configurable  variables  across multiple
       invocations.  Values are stored in a common per-user  file
       in a section reserved for the individual application.  All
       admin application values are collected together in a  sin-
       gle  file  avoiding  unnecessary file system pollution and
       providing the user with a central place  for  all  prefer-
       ences.

       SaScreenPolicy is implemented using the Stanza files.

       interfaces.  These should be handled eventually withError-
