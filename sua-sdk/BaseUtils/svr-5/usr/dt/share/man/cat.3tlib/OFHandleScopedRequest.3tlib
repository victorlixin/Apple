       OFHandleScopedRequest is called within a request processor
       to handle scoping and containment in a standard manner. It
       modifies  the  list  of  objects  associated with the BMIP
       request based on the scoping  parameter  passed  with  the
       object  request.  It  is used within an OSA which supplies
       its own request processor but wishes to provide the  stan-
       dard level of support for scoping, which includes the han-
       dling of first level scoping only.
