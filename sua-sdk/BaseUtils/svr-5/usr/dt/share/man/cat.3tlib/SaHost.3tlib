       These interfaces provide convenient handling of host names
       in the networked environment. An application can obtain  a
       fully  qualified domain name for the local host as well as
       the remote host being managed. This in turn can be  parsed
       to  extract  either  the  domain or the unqualified system
       name.

       SaHostsGet uses the local host's name service to obtain  a
       list of all known host names on the network. This is ideal
       for a user interface based on a point  and  pick  list  of
       host names.

       SaHostCheck  determines  whether or not the specified host
       is known to the name service of the local host. It returns
       true (1) or false (0) accordingly.

       SaHostRemoteOsaAccessible  provides  a simple boolean test
       for whether or not remote services are  available  through
       the admin framework. If the local host provides networking
       services and is properly attached to  a  live  network,  a
       remote OSA is considered accessible.
