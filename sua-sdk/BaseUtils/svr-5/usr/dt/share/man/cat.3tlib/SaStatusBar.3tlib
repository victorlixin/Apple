       SaStatusBar provides a convenient and consistent interface
       to manage graphical status bars  for  admin  applications.
       The  status  bar is typically used for intermittent status
       messages and for point help.  The main form dialog  of  an
       application  should  provide  a  status bar.  On secondary
       forms, they are optional.

       The status bar appears at the bottom of the  form,  delin-
       eated  from  the rest of the form above by a separator. It
       assumes the full width of the form with a space  for  text
       on  the  left and a admin icon on the right. A custom icon
       can be provided by the application.  Secondary form status
       bars ommit both the separator and the icon.

       The  SaShortHelp  and SaStatusBar interfaces were designed
       to be used together.  create a status bar on a  particular
       form.  Returns the widget string for a new form containing
       the status bar components. The status bar  should  be  the
       last  widget  created  on  the form.  sets the text string
       showing in the status bar.  gets the text  string  showing
       in the status bar.  clears the text string from the status
       bar.

       &VTcl; widget name for the new status bar. The  name  con-
       sists  of the widget string for the parent form and a name
       that is unique among other widgets on the form.   optional
       boolean indicating whether or not this status bar lives on
       the main form dialog or a secondary dialog. Default  is  1
       (true).   This  is  used to compute the size of the status
       bar in the CHARM (character Motif)  case.   optional  full
       pathname  of  a  pixmap  that will appear in the main form
       dialog status bar. Defaults to the standard  admin  status
       bar pixmap.  &VTcl; widget string (returned from SaStatus-
       Bar) for a specific status bar instance.  text  string  to
       appear in the status bar.
