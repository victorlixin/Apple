       These functions provide convenient handling  of  the  BMIP
       response  data  structure and its components while hidding
       its actual format from the caller.  A BMIP response is the
       return  value for all of the functions in the admin frame-
       work.  returns the operation name that the  BMIP  response
       is  an  output from.  returns the class name that the BMIP
       response is an output  from.   returns  the  name  of  the
       object  instance that the BMIP response is about.  returns
       the name of the attributes and their values  from  a  BMIP
       response.   returns  the  name of the specific action that
       resulted in this BMIP response.  returns  the  information
       supplied by the operation action to the client in the BMIP
       response.  returns the error stack  generated  by  a  BMIP
       Request.  returns the identifier for a specific error mes-
       sage on the error stack.  returns the text for a  specific
       error message on the error stack.  returns a boolean indi-
       cating whether or not there was an error  associated  with
       this BMIP response.
