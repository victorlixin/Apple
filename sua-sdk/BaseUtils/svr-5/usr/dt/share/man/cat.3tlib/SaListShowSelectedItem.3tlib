       In &VTcl;, selecting a list item and scrolling a list item
       into view are two different operations and are  not  func-
       tionally  or logically connected.  These procedures conve-
       niently relate  them,  providing  a  simple  interface  to
       scroll  selected  items  into  view  without knowing their
       position etc.   These  are  especially  useful  with  form
       dialogs  containing  lists that appear initially with pre-
       selected default items which are not necessarily the first
       items in the list.

       Both  procedures  will  scroll the minimal amount to bring
       the first of one or more selected items into view  in  the
       list  widget  window.  If this selected item is already in
       view, no scrolling occurs. The list may  scroll  backwards
       if  the  selected item is above the current view, in which
       case the item appears at the top. A forward scroll  to  an
       item below the current view leaves the item at the bottom.
       The selected item (possibly the  first  of  many)  may  be
       scrolled unconditionally to the first visible list item by
       using ``forcetop''.

       The  caller  must  distinguish  between  ``regular''   and
       ``drawn'' lists since &VTcl; uses two different interfaces
       and because there is no way to  determine  this  automati-
       cally.

       &VTcl;  list widget.  force the selected item to appear at
       the top of the list regardless of forward scroll direction
       (boolean).   SaListShowSelectedItem will automatically use
       the drawn list interface if this argument is set  to  any-
       thing nonzero. By default, it is 0.
