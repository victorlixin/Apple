       The file /var/yp/updaters is a makefile (see which is used
       for updating Network Information Service (NIS) data bases.

       Databases  can  only  be updated in a secure network, that
       is, one that has a data base.  Each entry in the file is a
       make  target for a particular NIS data base.  For example,
       if there is a NIS data base  named  publickey.byname  that
       can  be  updated, there should be a make target named pub-
       lickey.byname in the updaters file  with  the  command  to
       update the file.

       The  information necessary to make the update is passed to
       the update command through standard input.   The  informa-
       tion  passed is described below (all items are followed by
       a newline, except for the actual bytes of key  and  actual
       bytes  of  date).   network name of client wishing to make
       the update (a string) kind of update (an  integer)  number
       of bytes in key (an integer) actual bytes of key number of
       bytes in data (an integer) actual bytes of data

       After getting this information through standard input, the
       command  to  update the particular data base should decide
       whether the user is allowed to make the change.   If  not,
       it  should exit with the status YPERR_ACCESS.  If the user
       is allowed to make the change, the command should make the
       change  and  exit with a status of zero.  If there are any
       errors that  may  prevent  the  updater  from  making  the
       change,  it  should  exit  with  the status that matches a
       valid NIS error code described in <rpcsvc/ypclnt.h>.
