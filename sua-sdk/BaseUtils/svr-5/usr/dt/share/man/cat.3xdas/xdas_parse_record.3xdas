       The xdas_parse_record(3xdas) function is a member  of  the
       Basic XDAS Conformance class.

       xdas_parse_record(3xdas)  parses  and  decomposes a record
       number identified by  record_number  found  in  the  audit
       record  buffer, audit_record_buffer, which has been filled
       by a previous call to

       If  record_number  does  not   match   a   record   within
       audit_record_buffer,    xdas_parse_record(3xdas)   returns
       XDAS_S_INVALID_RECORD_NUMBER.

       On success, xdas_parse_record(3xdas)  returns  XDAS_S_COM-
       PLETE.
