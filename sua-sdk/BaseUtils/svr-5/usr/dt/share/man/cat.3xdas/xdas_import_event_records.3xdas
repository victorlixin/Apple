       The  xdas_import_event_records(3xdas) function is a member
       of the XDAS Import API Option Conformance class.

       xdas_import_event_records(3xdas) allows a caller to import
       audit  event  records  in  the XDAS format directly to the
       XDAS service. The caller places one or more complete audit
       event   records   into   the   buffer   referred   to   by
       audit_record_buffer from which they are copied  and  inte-
       grated  into  the  XDAS  audit stream.  The function reads
       audit records until the start of  a  next  record  is  not
       found.  The implementation may select the records that are
       actually imported based upon some selection criteria.  The
       caller  is  not  advised  of  the disposition of the audit
       records it submits.

       The caller must possess the XDAS_AUDIT_IMPORT authority.

       If successful, the function returns XDAS_S_COMPLETE.

       (Output) Provides further information  when  the  function
       returns XDAS_S_FAILURE.  (Input) A handle to the XDAS ser-
       vice obtained by a previous call to (Input) A buffer  into
       which  the  caller places the audit records to be imported
       into the XDAS audit stream.  (Output) If a  record  syntax
       error is detected, this parameter contains the position in
       the buffer at which the error was detected.

       The caller does not possess the required authority.   Suc-
       cessful  completion.   An implementation-specific error or
       failure has occurred, such as missing required parameters,
       or  a  malloc  failure.  The audit service handle supplied
       does not point to the audit service.  A syntax  error  has
       been detected in an input record.
