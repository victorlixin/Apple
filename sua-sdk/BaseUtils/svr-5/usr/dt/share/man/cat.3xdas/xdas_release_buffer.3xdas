       The xdas_release_buffer(3xdas) function is a member of the
       Basic XDAS Conformance class.

       xdas_release_buffer(3xdas) frees storage associated with a
       buffer.The storage must have been allocated by an XDAS-API
       function.  In  addition to freeing the associated storage,
       the function sets the length field in the buffer  argument
       to 0.

       On success, xdas_release_buffer(3xdas) returns XDAS_S_COM-
       PLETE.
