       The xdas_discard_record(3xdas) function is a member of the
       Basic XDAS Conformance class.

       xdas_discard_record(3xdas)  clears the buffer specified by
       audit_record_descriptor and releases the  memory  used  by
       it.

       The caller must possess the XDAS_AUDIT_SUBMIT authority.

       On success, xdas_discard_record(3xdas) returns XDAS_S_COM-
       PLETE.
