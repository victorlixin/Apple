       The  shutdown call shuts down all or part of a full-duplex
       connection on the socket associated with socket.   If  how
       is  SHUT_RD, then further receives will be disallowed.  If
       how is SHUT_WR, then further sends will be disallowed.  If
       how  is SHUT_RDWR, then further sends and receives will be
       disallowed.

       A 0 is returned if the call succeeds.   Otherwise,  -1  is
       returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       The  call  fails  if how is invalid or if: socket is not a
       valid descriptor.  The value of how  is  invalid.   System
       resources  were  insufficient  to  perform  the operation.
       There was insufficient user memory available for the oper-
       ation   to  complete.   There  were  insufficient  STREAMS
       resources available for the operation  to  complete.   The
       specified  socket is not connected.  socket is a file, not
       a socket.

       The how values should be defined constants.
