       To  accept  connections,  a  socket  is first created with
       socket, a backlog for incoming  connections  is  specified
       with  listen  and  then  the connections are accepted with
       accept.  The listen call applies only to sockets  of  type
       SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.

       If  the  parameter  tcp_q0limit  is  set to 0, the backlog
       parameter defines the maximum length to which  the  queues
       of  pending  (3-way  handshake incomplete) and established
       (3-way handshake complete) connections may grow.   A  con-
       nection request is silently dropped if it arrives when the
       pending queue is full.

       If the value of tcp_q0limit is greater than 0,  it  deter-
       mines  the maximum length of the pending connection queue.
       If a connection request arrives when the queue is full, an
       existing  pending  connection is dropped at random (RST is
       sent to the peer) and the new request  is  placed  on  the
       queue.   In  this case, the backlog parameter defines only
       the maximum length to  which  the  established  connection
       queue may grow.

       If  the value of backlog is less than 0, the length of the
       socket's listen queue (or queues) is set to 0.

       A value of 0 indicates success; -1 indicates an error.

       The call fails if:  socket  is  not  a  valid  descriptor.
       socket  is not a socket.  The socket is not of a type that
       supports the operation listen.  The socket is already con-
       nected  or has been shut down.  The socket is not bound to
       a local address, and the protocol does not support listen-
       ing  on  an unbound socket.  System resources are insuffi-
       cient to complete the call.
