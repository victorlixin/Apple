       The  set_t_errno  and  get_t_errno  functions  are used in
       TLI/XTI multithreaded applications to set and  return  the
       value  of t_errno.  These functions avoid the inconsisten-
       cies that may occur when t_errno is accessed  directly  in
       conditions of low memory.

       While get_t_errno and set_t_errno are designed for use  in
       multi-threaded applications, they are available for use in
       non-reentrant code and may be incorporated if  a  need  is
       anticipated to convert to reentrant code later.

       The  get_t_errno  and  set_t_errno  functions  may  not be
       available in other versions of the  operating system.

       You are encouraged not to set t_errno, either directly  or
       by calling set_t_errno.
