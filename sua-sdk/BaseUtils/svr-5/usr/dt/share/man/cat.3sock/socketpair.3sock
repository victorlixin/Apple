       The  socketpair  library  call  creates an unnamed pair of
       connected sockets in the specified address  family  d,  of
       the  specified  type,  and  using the optionally specified
       protocol.  The descriptors used  in  referencing  the  new
       sockets  are returned in sv[0] and sv[1].  The two sockets
       are indistinguishable.

       socketpair returns a -1 on failure, otherwise  it  returns
       the number of the second file descriptor it creates.

       The  call  succeeds  unless: The process does not have the
       appropriate privileges.  The specified address  family  is
       not  supported  on this machine.  Too many descriptors are
       in use by this process.   The  system  has  no  more  file
       descriptors  available.   There  were  insufficient system
       resources for the operation to complete.  There was insuf-
       ficient  user memory for the operation to complete.  There
       were insufficient STREAMS resources for the  operation  to
       complete.   The  specified  protocol does not support cre-
       ation of socket pairs.  The specified protocol is not sup-
       ported on this machine.  The protocol does not support the
       socket type.

       address family.
