       getsockname  returns  the  current  locally bound address,
       name, for socket s.  The namelen parameter should be  ini-
       tialized  to  indicate  the  amount of space pointed to by
       name.  On return it contains the actual size of  the  name
       returned (in bytes).

       If the socket has not been bound to a local name, getsock-
       name sets the value pointed to by namelen to 0,  and  puts
       nothing in the struct sockaddr pointed to by name.

       0 is returned if the call succeeds; -1 if it fails.

   EErrrroorrss
       The  call  succeeds unless: socket is not a valid descrip-
       tor.  socket is a file, not a socket.   The  operation  is
       not  supported  for  this  socket's  protocol.   There was
       insufficient user memory for the  operation  to  complete.
       There  were  insufficient  STREAMS resources available for
       the operation to complete.  The socket has been shut down.
       System resources were insufficient to complete the call.

       The  type  of  address  structure  passed  to  getsockname
       depends on the address family.
        domain sockets (address family AF_UNIX) require a  struct
       sockaddr_un  structure  as  defined  in sys/un.h; Internet
       domain IPv4 sockets (address  family  AF_INET)  require  a
       struct  sockaddr_in  structure as defined in netinet/in.h;
       Internet domain IPv6  sockets  (address  family  AF_INET6)
       require  a  struct  sockaddr_in6  structure  as defined in
       netinet/in.h.  Other address families  may  require  other
       structures.   Use the structure appropriate to the address
       family; cast the structure address  to  a  generic  struct
       sockaddr * in the call to getsockname and pass the size of
       the structure in the namelen argument.

       In &geminiREL; the sockaddr structure has been modified to
       support  variable  length  sockets. The net result of this
       modification is that the family member has been  shortened

                                                                1

       len. For more information on the new sockaddr  structures,
