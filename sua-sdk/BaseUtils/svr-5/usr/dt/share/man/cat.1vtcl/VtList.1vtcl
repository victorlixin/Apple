SSyynnooppssiiss
       VtList widgetName [options]

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Creates  a  List  object.  (Note  that the List object may
       exist with  or  without  ScrollBars;  see  the  -scrollBar
       option for details.)  Returns the List widget name.

   OOppttiioonnss
       Sets  a list of items for the List object.  Sets an inter-
       preter variable (string) that will  be  updated  with  the
       widget value. The update happens under the same conditions
       which  would  call  -callback,  but  before  -callback  is
       invoked.

       Setting  a value into the interpreter variable updates the
       widget in the  same  way  as  performing  VtListSelectItem
       -itemList on the widget.
