       Creates a RowColumn widget. Returns the widget name.  This
       widget is only used to force its children to be  laid  out
       in rows and columns.

       Sets how items contained in a RowColumn widget are packed.
       No packing is performed.  The x and y attributes  of  each
       entry  are  left  alone, and the column widget attempts to
       become large enough to enclose all entries.   All  entries
       are  placed  in  identically  sized  boxes.  The boxes are
       based on the largest height and width values  of  all  the
       children  widgets.  The value of numColumns determines how
       many boxes are  placed  in  the  major  dimension,  before
       extending  in the minor dimension.  Given the current ori-
       entation (horizontal or vertical) entries are  placed  one
       after  the other until the RowColumn must wrap.  A RowCol-
       umn will wrap when there is no room left  for  a  complete
       child  in  that dimension.  Wrapping occurs by beginning a
       new row or column in the next available  space.   Wrapping
       continues as often as necessary, until all of the children
       are laid out.  In the vertical  dimension  (columns),  the
       boxes  are set to the same width; in the horizontal dimen-
       sion (rows) the boxes are set to  the  same  depth.   Each
       entry's position in the major dimension is left unaltered;
       its position in the minor dimension is  set  to  the  same
       value as the greatest entry in that particular row or col-
       umn.  The position in the minor dimension of any  particu-
       lar  row  or  column  is  independent of all other rows or
       columns.
