       Hides  but  does  not  destroy an object.  This is used to
       hide the object for later retrieval.  Useful if  you  need
       to  hide  a  dialog that contains information which should
       not be destroyed.  Use VtShow to redisplay the object.

       VtHideDialog works similarly to VtHide,  but  is  able  to
       walk up the object tree until it finds a dialog to hide.

       Hides the entire dialog in which the widget resides.

       messages: no  widget  corresponding  to  widgetName  given
       option  is  not  valid for this widget too many or too few
       options specified

       VtHideDialog and VtUnManage are provided for backward com-
       patibility.   Use  VtHide  -dialog  to accomplish the same
       task.
