       Adds  a  working procedure.  Returns an identifier for the
       working procedure that is required by VtRemoveWorkProc  if
       you subsequently remove it.  A working procedure is called
       whenever the application is sitting idle.  After the work-
       ing  procedure  is  called,  control goes back to the main
       loop. If there are still no events in the queue, the work-
       ing  procedure  is  called again, and is repeatedly called
       whenever there are no other events happening (such as but-
       tons  being  pressed,  text being entered, and so on).  If
       more than one working procedure is  added  via  subsequent
       calls  to  VtAddWorkProc,  then  they  are called one at a
       time, in a round robin.

       A common use for working procedures is when  the  applica-
       tion  needs  to  do some work that the user can cancel out
       of.  The working procedure would  do  its  work  in  short
       time-slices, keeping track of its state.  Consequently, if
       the user cancels the operation, cleanup can be  done  that
       is dependent on the value of the state variables.
