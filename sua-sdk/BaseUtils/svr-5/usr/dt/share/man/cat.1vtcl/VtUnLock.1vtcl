       Unlocks the application.

   OOppttiioonnss
       Used  when  the  application has nested locks (that is, it
       has been locked multiple times) to unlock one layer of the
       nested  locks  as  opposed  to  unlocking  all the current
       locks.

       Do not do a VtUnLock to release the -autoLock  lock  until
       after you have done a VtShow of your secondary form.
