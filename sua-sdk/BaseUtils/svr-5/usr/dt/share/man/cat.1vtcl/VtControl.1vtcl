       This  command  is  used only in the character mode server.
       It is used to bring  the  server  in  and  out  of  curses
       raw/cooked  mode. (In cooked mode, the server preprocesses
       keyboard input to the application process;  in  raw  mode,
       all keypresses are transmitted directly.)

   OOppttiioonnss
       Resumes  the  character mode server and sets curses to raw
       mode.  Suspends the character mode server and sets  curses
       to cooked mode.
