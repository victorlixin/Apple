       Given two widgets which have been created with the  source
       widget  connected via -alignTop to the target widget, this
       sets the top offset of the source widget so that its base-
       line lines up with the target widget's baseline.

       The  widget  you are aligning to.  The widget that will be
       adjusted.  Any top offset the target  widget  already  has
       which  must  be taken into account. (This is optional; the
       default is 0.)
