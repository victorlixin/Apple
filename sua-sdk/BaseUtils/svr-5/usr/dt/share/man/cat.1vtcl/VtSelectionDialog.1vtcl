       Creates a Selection dialog which contains a set of widgets
       that allows the user to select an item from a list or type
       the item in a text field.  The text field is automatically
       updated to the item selected from the list. All the Dialog
       options  are  available to this widget. Returns the dialog
       widget's name.

       By default, Selection dialogs have an OK, Cancel, and Help
       button.  To override the default buttons, the options -ok,
       -cancel, and -help can be used to specify which buttons go
       in  the  dialog.  If any one of these options is used then
       it is assumed that only buttons which have been  individu-
       ally specified or referenced via either a label or a call-
       back option will be put in the dialog.

       If the user chooses either the OK or  Cancel  button,  the
       dialog is automatically popped down and destroyed, and the
       user's selection passed as a parameter to the OK callback.
       To   override  this  default  -autoHide  and  -autoDestroy
       options can be used.

       For example,  to  display  a  Selection  dialog  with  the
       choices  a,  b  or  c:  set  sb [VtSelectionDialog $but.sb
       -itemList {{a} {b} {c}}] VtShow $sb

       items.   Each  line of the file is considered a list item.
       The full pathname of the file must be specified.  Sets the
       list  of  items  for the selection box.  Sets the value of
       the selection in the selection text widget to string.  The
       item in the list is not highlighted.
