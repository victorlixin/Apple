       Rings the terminal bell.

       On  bitmapped terminals, specifies the number of millisec-
       onds the bell rings for.  On character  terminals,  speci-
       fies  100  times  the  number  of  times the terminal bell
       rings.  (For example, -duration 500 will ring the bell for
       half  a  second  on a bitmapped terminal, or ring the bell
       five times in succession on a  character  terminal.)   Set
       the  frequency  of the bell in Herz. (This defaults to the
       server default pitch. It  is  ignored  when  in  character
       mode.)   Sets the maximum volume n to ring the bell at (as
       for XBell(); the range is -100 to +100).  The  default  is
       50. (This option is ignored when in character mode.)
