       Creates  a  Scale which consists of a bar with a graphical
       representation that shows the current numerical  value  of
       the field.  Returns the widget name.

       For example: VtScale $form.scale -min 0 -max 100 -value 50

       Called when the value of Scale is changed.  The  value  of
       the  Scale  at  the time of the callback will be passed as
       part of the  callback  data.   The  key  to  reference  is
       ``value''.

       Additional callback keys: value of the Scale Sets the ori-
       entation to horizontal.  Sets  the  length  of  the  Scale
       (specified  in number of characters) to integer characters
       (in the character environment).  In the graphical environ-
       ment,  sets  the length of the Scale to integer multiplied
       by the maximum font width.  Sets the maximum value that  a
       Scale  can  have.  Sets the minimum value that a Scale can
       have.  Flag: if set, the slider is disabled.   When  TRUE,
       the VtScale's value is shown above the Scale.  The default
       is TRUE.  Updates the interpreter variable string with the
       widget value. The update happens under the same conditions
       that would  invoke  -callback,  but  before  -callback  is
       called.  Setting  a  value  into  the interpreter variable
       updates the Scale as if  setting  -value  on  the  widget.
       Sets  the  title  string  displayed  at  the bottom of the
       Scale.  Sets the current value (restricted in  range  from
       min to max.)  Sets the orientation to vertical.
