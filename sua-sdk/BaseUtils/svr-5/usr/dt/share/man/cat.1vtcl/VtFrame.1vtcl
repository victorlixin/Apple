       Creates  a  Frame  widget which places a three-dimensional
       border around a single child. Returns the widget  name  of
       the Frame.

       The  border can have different shadow types in the graphi-
       cal environment, but in the character mode  server  it  is
       just a single line.

       For  example,  to  create an empty box: set frame [VtFrame
       $form.frame -shadowType ETCHED_IN] set rowcol [VtRowColumn
       $frame.rowcol ] VtLabel $rowcol.lab1 -label "        "

       Specifies  that the Frame is to hold multiple children and
       that they are to be positioned as if the Frame was a Form.
       If  the  Frame  does  this  using a child Form the Form is
       named vt_frameForm.  Sets the shadow type  of  the  frame.
       Puts the title at the top of the frame widget. This is not
       supported in character mode.
