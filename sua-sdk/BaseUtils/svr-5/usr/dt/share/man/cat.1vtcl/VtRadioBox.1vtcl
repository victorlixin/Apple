       Works only in character mode.  If autoSelect is True, but-
       tons within the radiobox are automatically  selected  when
       traversing  to them.  The selection follows the focus when
       moving between radio buttons with the  arrow  keys.   This
       provides  behavior  equivalent  to the Microsoft Windowstm
       radiobox.  The default is False.  Sets the cmd called when
       a  toggle  button in the radiobox is selected.  This over-
       rides any callback set for the contained toggle buttons.

       Additional callback keys: selected toggle button  selected
       toggle button Suppresses the -callback when -value is set.
       Updates the interpreter variable string  with  the  widget
       value.  The  update happens under the same conditions that
       would invoke -callback, but before  -callback  is  called.
       Setting  a value into the interpreter variable updates the
       RadioBox as if setting -value on the widget.  Turns on the
       widgetName  passed  in toggle button.  To use this option,
       also set -noCallback.  if the widget's parent is a form.
