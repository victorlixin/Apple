       Specifies the callback cmd. This is called when one of two
       conditions occurs:

       The value changed and the widget lost focus.

       The  keypress was received in the ComboBox text.

       Additional callback key: value in text field of  the  Com-
       boBox.   Make the object integer columns wide.  This means
       that integer characters are shown.  In the graphical envi-
       ronment  this  will make the width of the object integer *
       MaxCharwidth wide (where MaxCharwidth is the width of  the
       largest character in the current character set).  Sets the
       callback cmd, called when the droplist on the ComboBox  is
       opened.

       Additional  callback keys: value in text field of ComboBox
       Sets a list of items for the  ComboBox  object.   Disables
       entry  into  the  text field of the ComboBox widget.  Data
       may still be set  by  choosing  items  from  the  ComboBox
       droplist.   Makes the object display integer rows of text.
       If there are more than integer rows, the object will  pro-
       vide  a  vertical  ScrollBar (to permit scrolling over the
       entire list). If there are less than  integer  rows,  only
       that number of items will be shown. (The default value for
       integer is 6.)  Updates the  interpreter  variable  string
       with  the  widget value. The update happens under the same
       conditions that would invoke -callback, but before  -call-
       back is called. Setting a value into the interpreter vari-
       able updates the ComboBox as if setting -value on the wid-
       get.  Sets the string to put in the text field in the Com-
       boBox.  Sets the callback cmd called after text is deleted
       from or inserted into the widget.
