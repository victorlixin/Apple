       Sets a row of data for the DrawnList.  The default format-
       ting is used on the list if you do not specify -formatList
       in the command.

       For  example:  -formatList  {{ICON  2} {STRING 20} {STRING
       15}}  \ -fieldList  [list 1 "John Doe" "555-1212"] See the
       note  below.  Describes the columns used in the DrawnList.
       This field contains a list of column  descriptions.   Each
       column description in turn is a list containing the column
       type, the column width, and the column's  left  and  right
       margins.   The syntax is: { TYPE WIDTH [Left Margin, Right
       Margin] } The left and right margins are optional  parame-
       ters.   The  following  specifies a column that is of type
       ICON, with a width of 1 icon and a left and  right  margin
       of 5 pixels.  { ICON 1 5 5 } Valid types are ICON, STRING,
       and DATA.  DATA does not display on the screen; it is used
       to store item-specific data.

       For example: -formatList { {ICON 3} {STRING 20 5} {DATA} }
       The first column is an icon field with a width of  3,  the
       second  column  contains a string with a width of 20 and a
       left margin of 5, and the  third  column  contains  hidden
       data.   Sets  whether  or  not  a horizontal scroll bar is
       drawn. You should set the boolean value  to  TRUE  if  you
       want  a  horizontal  scroll bar, FALSE if not. The default
       value is FALSE.  This is ignored in character  mode.   The
       Maximum  size  is  the width of formatList.  If formatList
       changes, the maximum size will change too.

       To display a horizontal scrollbar in character  mode,  you
       must  set  the -width and -columns options. Otherwise, the
       widget will grow as needed and the  scrollbars  will  only
       appear  when  the list exceeds the available area.  Sets a
       list of pixmap filenames to use in the DrawnList on graph-
       ical  systems. On character systems, specify characters to
       display instead of pixmap filenames.  Options specific  to
       character  displays  should  be prefixed with CHARM_.  For
       example: -CHARM_iconList {a  b  c}  -MOTIF_iconList  {a.px
       b.px  c.px}  (In  this example, graphical systems load the
       pixmaps a.px, b.px, and c.px; character  systems  load  no
       pixmaps,  but  display  instead  the letters a, b, and c.)
       Similar to -formatList but applies  to  the  label.  (This
       option  is not available in character mode.) Type ICON may
       be used as a format identifier but currently icons are not
       supported  in  DrawnList labels.  Sets the label above the
       DrawnList. (Similar to -fieldList, except that it  applies
       to the label. The format used in -labelFormatList is used.

                                                                1

       This feature is not available  in  character  mode.   Note
       that  currently  icons  are  not  supported  in  DrawnList
       labels.  Sets whether or not  a  vertical  scroll  bar  is
       drawn.  You  should  set  the boolean value to TRUE if you
       want a vertical scroll bar,  FALSE  if  not.  The  default
       value  is  TRUE.  This option is ignored in character mode
       (a vertical scrollbar is displayed if necessary).

       When specifying an icon index in -fieldList or -recordList
       the  following indexes can be used to reference connection
       icons or no icons: CONNECT_L CONNECT_I CONNECT_T NO_ICON

       For example: VtDrawnListAddItem $lst \
           -formatList {{ICON 5} {STRING 20 5}} \
           -fieldList {"CONNECT_I NO_ICON 1 CONNECT_H  2" "Multi-
       ple icons" }

                                                                2
