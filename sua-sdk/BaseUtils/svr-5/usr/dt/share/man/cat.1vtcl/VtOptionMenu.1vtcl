DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Creates an OptionMenu widget which is a menu system compo-
       nent that lets a  user  select  one  of  several  choices.
       OptionMenus  are  created  like Pulldown menus.  First the
       OptionMenu is created and then it is  ``filled''  in  with
       other  widgets. (The Label class options are supported, so
       that the OptionMenus can be titled.) Returns  the  Option-
       Menu widget's name.

       For example, to create an OptionMenu with the options dog,
       cat, and frog: set menu  [VtOptionMenu  $form.menu  -label
       "Pick  one:" set but1 [VtPushButton $menu.but1 -label dog]
       set but2 [VtPushButton $menu.but2  -label  cat]  set  but3
       [VtPushButton  $menu.but3  -label  frog]  Callbacks can be
       assigned to the  individual  widgets  which  make  up  the
       OptionMenu,  or  a callback can be assigned to the Option-
       Menu itself.  If this is done, callbacks assigned  to  the
       OptionMenu  children will be overridden and the OptionMenu
       callback will be called if any of the children  are  acti-
       vated.   The  child which caused the callback to be called
       will be passed as callback data.

       Sets callback cmd as the routine to call when any  of  the
       options  are  activated  (by , , or a single mouse click).
       This callback overrides any activation callbacks  assigned
       to children of the option menu

       Additional  callback  keys:  The  name  of the widget that
       activated this callback The name of the widget that  acti-
       vated  this callback Specifies the name of the widget that
       is selected in the option menu.  if the OptionMenu  parent
       is a Form.
