       Creates  a  Text object and returns the widget name.  Text
       fields display text in a box.  The  text  is  editable  by
       default,  but  you can make it read-only. You can create a
       single line of text, or multiple lines.  Text  fields  are
       useful  for  displaying  text or for fields where the user
       needs to enter a value.

       Sets the callback to call when data is changed in a single
       line  text object and either a return keypress is received
       or the mouse pointer moves to another field.

       Additional callback keys: contents  of  the  text  widget.
       Make  the  object  integer  number  of columns wide.  This
       means that integer characters are shown.  In the graphical
       environment this will make the width of the object integer
       * Max_Charwidth wide.  Sets a file  (named  string)  whose
       contents  will  be  displayed  in  the  text widget.  Sets
       whether to include a horizontal ScrollBar.  If TRUE a hor-
       izontal  ScrollBar  is  displayed.   The  default value is
       FALSE. This option is ignored in character mode.  Sets the
       command  to  call  when the text widget loses focus.  This
       routine is called  regardless  of  whether  the  text  has
       changed.

       Additional  callback keys: value of the text widget.  When
       set, turns off echoing.  When set, disables editing of the
       text  widget.  Sets the number of character rows displayed
       in an object.  Updates  the  interpreter  variable  string
       with  the  widget value. The update happens under the same
       conditions that would invoke -callback, but before  -call-
       back is called. Setting a value into the interpreter vari-
       able updates the Text widget as if setting -value  on  the
       widget.  Sets the string value of the text.  Sets the com-
       mand called after text is inserted into  or  deleted  from
       the widget.

       Additional  callback  keys:  value  of the object.  Set to
       TRUE for a vertical  scroll  bar,  otherwise  FALSE.   The
       default  value  is  FALSE.   This  is ignored in character
       mode.  When set, turns word wrap on.
