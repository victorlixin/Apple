       These  routines  are part of the RPC library that allows C
       language  programs  to  make  procedure  calls  on   other
       machines  across the network, with desired authentication.
       First, the client calls a procedure to send a data  packet
       to  the  server.   Upon  receipt of the packet, the server
       calls a dispatch routine to perform the requested service,
       and then sends back a reply.

       These  routines  are  normally  called  after creating the
       CLIENT handle.  The client's authentication information is
       passed to the server when the RPC call is made.

       The  following  routines  require that the header rpc.h be
       included (see for the definition of the AUTH  data  struc-
       ture).   void  auth_destroy(AUTH  *auth); A function macro
       that destroys the  authentication  information  associated
       with  auth.   Destruction usually involves deallocation of
       private data structures.  The use  of  auth  is  undefined
       after calling auth_destroy.  AUTH * authnone_create(void);
       Create and return an RPC authentication handle that passes
       nonusable authentication information with each remote pro-
       cedure call.  This is the default authentication  used  by
       RPC.   AUTH * authsys_create(const char *host, const uid_t
       uid, const gid_t gid,       const  int  len,  const  gid_t
       *aup_gids); Create and return an RPC authentication handle
       that contains AUTH_SYS  authentication  information.   The
       parameter  host  is  the  name of the machine on which the
       information was created; uid is the user's user ID; gid is
       the  user's  current group ID; len and aup_gids refer to a
       counted array of groups to which the user belongs.  AUTH *
       authsys_create_default(void); Call authsys_create with the
       appropriate parameters.
