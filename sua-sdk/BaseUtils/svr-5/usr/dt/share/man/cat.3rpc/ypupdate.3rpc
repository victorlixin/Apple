       yp_update is used to make changes  to  the  NIS  database.
       The  syntax is the same as that of yp_match except for the
       extra parameter ypop, which may take on one of  four  val-
       ues.   If  it is YPOP_CHANGE then the data associated with
       the key will be changed to the new value.  If the  key  is
       not  found  in  the  database,  then yp_update will return
       YPERR_KEY.  If ypop has the  value  YPOP_INSERT  then  the
       key-value  pair  will  be inserted into the database.  The
       error YPERR_KEY is returned if the key already  exists  in
       the  database.  To store an item into the database without
       concern for whether it exists already or not, pass ypop as
       YPOP_STORE  and  no  error  will  be  returned  if the key
       already or does not exist.  To delete an entry, the  value
       of ypop should be YPOP_DELETE.

       This  routine  depends  upon secure RPC, and will not work
       unless the network is running secure RPC.
