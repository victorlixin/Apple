       uts is an automated test suite that finds rendering errors
       in  a graphics adapter driver and is useful for regression
       testing after making changes to such a driver.

       uts is provided in source form.  You must build  it,  then
       run it, then generate a report by selecting each option in
       order.  uts uses the native C compiler and X11R6  Develop-
       ment  System  to build.  These are installed by default on
       &geminiREL; systems and can  be  installed  from  the  UDK
       media on &everest; systems.
