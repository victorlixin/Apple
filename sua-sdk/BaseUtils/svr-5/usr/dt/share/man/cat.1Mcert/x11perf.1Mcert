       x11perf  tests  the relative speed of your graphic adapter
       driver on a specific graphic adapter and computer combina-
       tion.   Use  it to verify incremental performance improve-
       ments when an acceleration routine is added or tuned.  Use
       x11perf  with  for  flooding the graphic adapter card with
       drawing requests.

       The following options can be supplied in  any  order:  Run
       all  tests.   Similar to -all, but do <test1> to <test2> X
       server to contact.  Run the  tests  in  synchronous  mode.
       Number of seconds each iteration should run; default value
       is 5.  number of iterations to run; default  value  is  5.
       Pack  rectangles  right next to each other.  Generate test
       labels for use by  fillblnk.   Foreground  color  to  use.
       Background color to use.  Number of clip windows per test.
       Background color to use for DoubleDash.  Use the specified
       planemasks  to  draw;  default  is  ~0.  Use a visual with
       <depth> planes per pixel.  Visual class to use; default is
       root.   Fix the rep count; default is auto scale.  List of
       the number of sub-windows to use.  Request save unders  on
       windows.   Specify a hint for backing store.  Valid values
       are WhenMapped, Always, and NotUseful (default).   Specify
       individual  tets.  For a complete list of valid names, run
       x11perf with no arguments.  raster ops to use.  Valid val-
       ues are GXcopy and GXxor.  The default is Gxcopy; the most
       common usage is to specify both.  Perform only v1.2  tests
       using  old  semantics.   Perform only v1.3 tests using old
       semantics.

       is the officially preferred tool for  measuring  X  server
       performance.   x11perf attempts to run through most of the
       X drawing operations and characterizes how many  of  these
       operations  the  X server can perform in a given period of
       time.  x11perf allows the user  to  specify  a  number  of
       important  Graphics  Context  (GC) modifications including
       colors, planemask, and GXcopy  and  GXxor  (the  two  main
       raster  ops used by X clients).  When undertaking a server
       port using the  link  kit,  the  driver  writer  typically
       investigates x11perf output to determine areas where the X
       server has inadequate performance.

       x11perf includes tools that allow  you  to  compare  every

       drawing  operation  against  an x11perf run from another X
       server  to  find  out  where  differences  exist   between
       servers.   x11perf  can  also be used to classify X server
       performance in general areas such as  terminal  emulation,
       or drawing many large objects, or many small objects.

       Note that x11perf takes a significant amount of time, even
       when run with small values for -time and -repeat.

       x11perf can also be run using

       The following command line  runs  x11perf  quickly,  as  a
       first  pass  integrity  check  of  the  X server with your
       driver configured: x11perf -all -time  1  -repeat  2  -rop
       GXcopy GXxor If that quick run works properly, run x11perf
       for a longer stress test of the X server with the  follow-
       ing  command:  x11perf  -all -time 3 -repeat 3 -rop GXcopy
       GXxor To run  x11perf  through  the  test  harness:  $  cd
       /usr/xlink/Xserver/tests/x11perf     $    ./RunTests    -q
       # for the quick run $ ./RunTests               #  for  the
       thorough  test  Results are archived in the ./results file
       in     the     tests/x11perf     directory.      $      cd
       <test_archive>/x11perf                                 $cp

       ./RunTests   -q         #   for   the    quick    run    $
       ./RunTests        #  for  the thorough test <test_archive>
       is usually a subdirectory to the <working_directory> where
       the  source  code is developed but can be any directory on
       the system.  Results are archived in the ./results file in
       the <test_archive>/x11perf directory.
