       xbench performs a standard performance benchmark test on a
       graphic adapter driver and associated hardware.  Use it in
       combination  with  the  tests to flood the graphic adapter
       with drawing requests.

       Runtime per test, in seconds; default  is  10.   Numer  of
       runs  per  tests; default is 3.  Use <name> as the server.
       Number of tests made; default is 1.  Runtime per test,  in

       default is 3.  Print list of available tests to  use  with
       the -only and -not options.  Only run the <testname> spec-

       xbench runs through a series of X drawing  requests  (that
       by  no  means  fully  exercises all the things that can be
       drawn with an X server).  The output from xbench  is  then
       run through a script that produces an average speed rating
       for several classes of drawing operations  such  as  text,
       blit,  line  drawing,  and so forth.  All of these numbers
       are then used to calculate a final number, referred to  as
       an  xStone.   An  old X Journal magazine has a lengthy and
       repetitious article on why the Xstone number  is  next  to
       useless  in  determining  the  actual  usability  of  an X
       server.  This hasn't stopped a number  of  advertisers  in
       the  same  magazine  from  printing  xStone  numbers  that
       clearly show the inadequacies that are  explained  in  the
       article.

       xbench can also be run through the harness.

       To run xbench quickly as a first pass integrity check, use
       the following command line: xbench -timegoal 1 -nrunx 1 If
       that  quick  run  works properly, run xbench without argu-
       ments for a 30-minute stress test of the X server:  xbench
       To   run   xbench   through   the   test   harness:  $  cd
       /usr/xlink/Xserver/tests/xbench    $     ./RunTests     -q
       #  for  the  quick run $ ./RunTests              # for the
       thorough test Results are archived in the  ./results  file
       in the tests/xbench directory.  $ cd <test_archive>/xbench
       $cp  /usr/ddk/src/native/nfb/tools/xbench/xbench  .    $cp
       /usr/ddk/src/native/nfb/tools/xbench/RunTests     .      $

       usually a subdirectory to  the  <working_directory>  where
       the  source  code is developed but can be any directory on
       the system.  Results are archived in the ./results file in

       The xbench test is included in the xtests package that can
       be downloaded from or installed from the HDK CD-ROM.
