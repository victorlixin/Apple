       Install  the  test  suites.  Log in as hbacert.  Issue the
       run_tests command from a terminal window  to  display  the
       menu.   Select the Configure Tests menu option, select the
       test(s) to be configured, and populate the  parameters  as
       they are displayed.  Return to the menu and select the Run
       Tests menu option.  Select the test(s)  to  be  run.   You
       will be prompted for anything else that is required.  When
       the tests are complete, select  the  Gather  Results  menu
       option.   After  the results are gathered, select the View
       Results menu option.  Enter the name of the test for which
       you  want  to  view  the  results,  or  press  to view all
       results.

       The hbacert test and certification suites are used to test
       SDI HBA and target drivers with their associated hardware.

       Configuration parameters are defined for each test.  These
       parameters  are  located  in  the /home/hbacert/testsuites
       directory tree,  in  files  named  <testname>/tetexec.cfg.
       For   example,   the   hba-hd   parameters   are   in  the
       hd/tetexec.cfg file.  In some cases, you will have to man-
       ually edit these files.

   hhbbaa--CCDD--RROOMM ppaarraammeetteerrss
       Character special device name of the CD-ROM device.  Block
       special device name of the CD-ROM  device.   Name  of  the
       directory  where  the  CD-ROM  filesystem will be mounted.
       Default is /mnt.  Number of times  to  repeat  the  stress
       test.

   hhbbaa--ffdddd ppaarraammeetteerrss
       Number  of  bytes  read or written on each I/O call to the
       floppy disk.  A higher value for this parameter means that
       each  read  and  write operation takes more time, so fewer
       calls are made.  An optimum value for  this  parameter  is
       8192.   Number  of  times command tests (format, cpio, dd,
       and so forth) will be repeated on the floppy disk.  Floppy
       disk  density  type,  expressed in either MB or KB.  Valid
       values are:

       double density 360KB  floppy  disk  quad  density  1.2  MB
       floppy disk double density 720 KB floppy disk high density
       1.44 MB floppy disk  high  density  2.88  MB  floppy  disk
       Floppy  disk  stress  test  duration in minutes.  A recom-
       mended value for this parameter is 60 minutes.

       Must be set to all.

       No  configuration  is  required  for  this suite of manual
       tests for HBA  devices.   See  for  detailed  instructions
       about running these tests.

   hhbbaa--ppddiixx
       Character  device  name  of the first device being tested.
       This device is used as the primary device for  every  test
       in  this  suite.   For  example,  pass-through  ioctls are
       tested only for the DEV1_NAME device.  If DEV1_NAME  is  a
       tape  device,  this  is  the  density  code of the device.
       Character device name of the second device  being  tested.
       If DEV2_NAME is a tape device, this is the density code of
       the device.

   hhbbaa--ppcceerrtt
       Name of the floppy device.  Type of file system  used  for
       the HBA driver package on the floppy.

   hhbbaa--ttaappee
       Character  special  file (node name) of the tape device to
       be tested.  Density of the tape device being tested.  Val-
       ues for each device type are:
       QIC tape   SCSI-2 density code

       Set  to  1  if  the erase option is supported in the back-
       ground.  Set to 1 if skipping file marks backward is  sup-
       ported.   Set  to  1  if  skipping blocks backward is sup-
       ported.
