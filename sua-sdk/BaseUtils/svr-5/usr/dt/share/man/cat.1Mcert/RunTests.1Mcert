       RunTests provides a front end for running the  and  tests.
       The  specific test that is run is determined by the direc-
       tory from which the RunTests command  is  executed.   Note
       that,  for &geminiREL; and &everest;, the tests are always
       run from the directory where the tests are stored  on  the
       system.   For  AIX  5L, the tests can be run anywhere, but
       are typically copied to  the  <test_archive>  subdirectory
       under the <working_directory> where the driver source code
       is  developed   and   then   run   from   this   location.

       Results of the test are saved in the summary file  in  the
       directory  where RunTests is run.  Detailed reports on the
       tests are saved in the results directory.

       x11perf and xbench; uts is not supported for AIX 5L.
