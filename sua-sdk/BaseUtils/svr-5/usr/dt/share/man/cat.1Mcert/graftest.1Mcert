       graftest  verifies  that  all  modes  work  and that the X
       server root weave and mouse cursor appear  on  the  screen
       corectly.   graftest  prompts  you  to run each resolution
       that is listed in the file.  It  takes  an  argument  that
       specifies   the   full   path   of   the  file,  typically
       /usr/lib/grafinfovendormodel.xgi.  vendor is the  hardware
       vendor  name  to  match the contents of the VENDOR string;
       model is the adapter type or model to match  the  contents
       of the MODEL string.

       By  default,  graftest  uses the video driver installed in
       the /usr/lib/X11/dyddx directory.  If you have created  an
       XServer  that  is  statically linked to your video driver,
       you can specify the path of that XServer to  the  graftest
       command  and  it will be used instead of the default video
       driver.

UUssaaggee
       Use this test to step through  all  supported  resolutions
       and  modes  to ensure that the root weave and mouse cursor
       appear on the screen correctly.
