       documents  a  new  test  suite that replaces loadtests and
       hcptest.  plt can be downloaded from the for either  plat-
       form.   The old documenation is retained for reference but
       will be  removed  in  a  future  release.   loadtests  and
       hcptest  are  the  interfaces to an earlier suite of tests
       that exercise a computer system under a heavy load.  These
       tests were used to qualify computer systems with the &gem-
       iniREL; or &everest; operating system.  These  suites  can
       also  be  used  to  test  kernel  sanity  after new device
       drivers and other kernel-level code have been added.

       These test should run from 36-48 hours without  errors  in
       order  to  give reasonable confidence of system and driver
       sanity; specific requirements will  be  specified  by  the
       certification agreement.

       To run the tests Log in as root and run the /usr/bin/load-
       tests program on &geminiREL; or the /usr/bin/hcptest  pro-
       gram on &everest;.

       The  tests  display  notices  on  the screen, ask for user
       input, and allow the user to select the tests that will be
       run.   At  the menu screen, enter 1 (the number one), fol-
       lows by to run the Balanced Load Tests.

       You will see the description string  change  to  READY  TO
       RUN.   Enter  r to run the tests.  Insert a scratch floppy
       disk in the floppy drive, then enter c in response to  the
       program  prompt.   The  tests  will then begin.  Enter  to
       terminate test execution.  It could take  several  minutes
       for the system to respond; please be patient.

       The  tests'  stderr content is redirected to a file in the
       log directory.  Examine these  files  for  error  messages
       after  the  tests  complete.  Note that some files in this
       directory are empty (have a size of  0  bytes).   This  is
       normal  and acceptable and indicates that the test did not
       generate an error.  Also, some of the files contain infor-
       mational log entries that are not errors.

       The  tests write a timestamp to the log/date.dat file once
       each minute.  Should the test suite fail,  or  should  the
       system hang or panic, subtracting the first timestamp from
       the last timestamp will provide the elapsed time the tests
       ran.   The last timestamp in this file determines the date
       and time at which there was a failure.

       Note the  following:  System  auditing  must  be  disabled

       before running loadtests or the hard drive will rapidly be
       filled with auditing log files.  System auditing  is  dis-
       abled by default.  On systems with 32MB of memory or less,
       the X server should be disabled before the tests are  run.
       To do this, run the following as root: /usr/bin/X11/scolo-
       gin disable You may also have to disable optional services
       such  as ArcServ and VisionFS to obtain enough free memory
       for the tests.

       The log files may contain  status  messages  that  do  not
       indicate failures in the tests.
