       color3 is run with to verify that the resolution and modes
       configured on vt01 (tty01) and vt02 (tty02)  display  cor-
       rectly.

       The  options are: Verbose Mode; outputs color map informa-
       tion from the X server.  See xdpyinfo(X1M) for more infor-
       mation.  Show version Stop painting shade after <num> col-
       ors.  This is used to check bit pattern  problems.   After
       displaying  and  painting  the window, exit and quit after
       sleeping <sec> seconds.  Note that using an  alarm  (which
       is not recommended in X programming) may cause a client to
       core dump depending upon what is happening with  the  data
       stream  to the server.  Get help for the command.  To save
       the output to a file: ./color3 -h > color3.help

       color3 draws a shaded background and a color wheel pattern
       utilizing  all  the  colormap entries, then excercises the
       color palette.  Keystrokes are used to examine  the  color
       possibilities  when  the  window has focus: Quit and exit.
       Display a palette of only red colors.  Display  a  palette
       of only blue colors.  Display a palette of only green col-
       ors.  Display a palette of only shades of gray.  Display a
       palette  of  colors  based  on  hue, saturation, lightness
       model.  Display the initial  colormap  in  effect  at  the
       startup  of  this client.  On TrueColor displays, displays
       all the colors.  Only  a  few  pixels  are  displayed  per
       color;  this  is a crowded display to say the least.  This
       does not work correctly on a 24 bit display with 16M  col-
       ors,  but  it does attempt to draw all the colors.  Allows
       adjustment of saturation  and  lightness  of  the  colored
       palette: lightness changing when the mouse is moved on the
       y axis, and saturation changing when the mouse is moved on
       the  x  axis.  While this adjustment is being made, primi-
       tive slide scales are displayed on the  bottom  and  right
       sides  of  the  window.  The scales range from 0 to 100 %;
       the initial value for lightness is 50 % and saturation  is
       100  %.   If  the  screen  goes black, just type n or N to
       recover.  Note that, on TrueColor  displays,  the  pattern
       must be redrawn in order to change.  When available on the
       server, quit and exit.  Similar to button 1, but this time
       will  adjust the colors that were available for read/write
       from the default colormap instead of its own private  col-
       ormap.   If  the colormap was completely busy, this opera-
       tion is a noop.  Another difference from button 1 is  that
       this operation changes the saturation and hue, rather than
       the saturation and lightness.  The lightness value used is
       whatever is left over from use of button 1.  Note that, on
       TrueColor displays, the pattern must be redrawn  in  order

       While  running  color3,  verify that the correct number of
       colors are displayed (for example, 256, 64K).  Resize  and
       move  the  color3  window  around the screen and check for
       screen corruption.

       If color3 appears solid white or black, try  resizing  the
       window.   The colorwheel will appear after doing this.  If
       you expose a covered portion of the color3 window  and  it
       does not redraw, resize the window again.  This is a known
       problem with the color3 test and does not indicate a prob-
       lem with your graphics adapter driver.

       The color3 test is included in the xtests package that can
       be downloaded from or installed from the HDK CD-ROM.   The
       AIX 5L version is also available from

       color3  has been tested for 2 color StaticGrey, 16 and 256
       Color PseudoColor, 32K TrueColor and 24 bit TrueColor dis-
       plays.

       On  the  SGI  24  bit  server, the red and blue fields are
       reversed.

       Almost no error checking is performed on the  Xlib  calls.
       Often the client will not recognize its first expose event
       and result in an initial blank window.  Simply change  the
       window  size to cause an expose event and it will draw its
       pattern.

       color3 consumes significant server time during  its  draw-
       ing.   Event  checking should be placed within its drawing
       loop to give the server time to do something else.
