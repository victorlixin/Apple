       hcptest is the interface to a suite of tests that exercise
       a computer system under a heavy  load.   These  tests  are
       used  to  qualify  computer  systems  with the &geminiREL;
       operating system.  To qualify,  the  Balanced  Load  Tests
       must  execute  without  errors for 36 hours.  These suites
       can also be used to test kernel sanity  after  new  device
       drivers and other kernel-level code have been added.

       To   run   the   tests   Log   in  as  root  and  run  the
       /usr/bin/hcptest program.

       hcptest displays notices on  the  screen,  asks  for  user
       input,  and  allows the user to select the tests that will
       be run.  At the menu screen, enter  1  (the  number  one),
       follows by to run the Balanced Load Tests.

       You  will  see  the  description string change to READY TO
       RUN.  Enter r to run the tests.  Insert a  scratch  floppy
       disk  in the floppy drive, then enter c in response to the
       program prompt.  The tests will  then  begin.   Enter   to
       terminate  test  execution.  It could take several minutes
       for the system to respond; please be patient.

       The tests' stderr content is redirected to a file  in  the
       /home/hcptest/log  directory.   Examine  these  files  for
       error messages after the tests complete.  Note  that  some
       files  in  this  directory  are  empty  (have  a size of 0
       bytes).  This is normal and acceptable and indicates  that
       the  test  did  not  generate an error.  Also, some of the
       files contain  informational  log  entries  that  are  not
       errors.

       hcptest      writes      a      timestamp      to      the
       /home/hcptest/tests/log/date.dat file  once  each  minute.
       Should  the  test suite fail, or should the system hang or
       panic, subtracting  the  first  timestamp  from  the  last
       timestamp  will  provide  the  elapsed time the tests ran.
       The last timestamp in this file determines  the  date  and
       time at which there was a failure.

       Note  the  following:  System  auditing  must  be disabled
       before running hcptest or the hard drive will  rapidly  be
       filled  with  auditing log files.  System auditing is dis-
       abled by default.  On systems with 32MB of memory or less,
       the  X  server  should be disabled before hcptest are run.
       To do this, run the following as root: /usr/bin/X11/scolo-
       gin  disable  You  may also have to disbable optional ser-
       vices such as ArcServ and VisionFS to obtain  enough  free
       memory for the tests.

       The  log  files  may  contain  status messages that do not
       indicate failures in the tests.

       The System Load Tests suite contains several tests groups,
       described  below.  and system calls are exercised to allo-
       cate and free memory continuously over  a  wide  range  of
       addresses.  Tests the floating point calculations by using
       and Files are created, copied, and removed to exercise the
       filesystem.   is  run  to  verify filesystem integrity.  A
       continuous format and loop is  executed.   Data  transfers
       occur  using  30K blocks.  Recursive and commands are exe-
       cuted to exercise the CD-ROM subsystem.  An unmounted CDFS
       filesystem  CD-ROM  must  be installed in the drive before
       starting the test.
