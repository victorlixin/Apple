       The configuration monitor is the decision-making module of
       the Reliant software.  It controls the  configuration  and
       access  to  all  Reliant  cluster resources. If a resource
       fails, the configuration monitor analyzes the failure  and
       initiates the appropriate action according to the specifi-
       cations for the resource in the nodes configuration  file.

       The  hvstart  command  starts  the following modules which
       support the configuration monitor: communications  daemons
       (commdc and commds), (GUI) graphical user interface daemon
       (guiD), and detectors for all Reliant  cluster  resources.
       The  hvstart  command  takes the following option: Specify
       the nodes configuration file.  If this option is not spec-
       ified,  hvstart  assumes  the  nodes configuration file is
       called config.

       All nodes running Reliant MUST be running the same config-
       uration file.

       It  is  the  users  responsibility to ensure that the same
       configuration is copied to all systems. If one of the sys-
       tems is down, the configuration file should be copied onto
       that system when it comes up.

       Failure to do so can result in system panics  and/or  data
       corruption.   The  Reliant processes should be the highest
       priority processes running on the system. These  processes
       are  run  as  high priority real time processes.  The user
       should not alter their priority  or  run  other  processes
       with a higher priority.
