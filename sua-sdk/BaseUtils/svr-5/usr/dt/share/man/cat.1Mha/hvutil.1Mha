       The  -f  option  of  the hvutil command is used to bring a
       userApplication offline.

       The userApplication must be online. The command will  fail
       if the application is offline or LOCKED. An application is
       LOCKED if it is in the process of coming up or  down.   An
       application  faults  when  one  or  more  of its dependent
       resources unexpectedly goes offline.  The  fault  must  be
       cleared before the application can be run or migrated back
       to the system where it faulted.

       The -c option of the hvutil command is used to  clear  the
       fault.

       The  fault  can be cleared by issuing the command from the
       system where the application faulted.

       Do not clear the fault if the  application  is  marked  as
       LOCKED.   See  the following section on unlocking applica-
       tions.

       This option will not clear a faulted resource which is  of
       the  type  "always  online".  The only way to clear such a
       resource is by fixing the actual problem.  An  application
       is  typically LOCKED when it is in the process of starting
       up or shutting down. Normally the LOCK is removed when the
       application successfully starts up or shuts down. However,
       if the startup or shutdown operation  does  not  complete,
       the  application  stays  LOCKED and cannot be started any-
       where else.

       The -u option of the hvutil command can be used to  remove
       the lock.

       Before  issuing this command make sure that: All resources
       in the  application  dependency  tree  are  offline.   Any
       scripts  or  programs  running  in the background that can
       bring any of these resources online, are terminated.

       Failure to do so can result in data corruption due to  the
       same  resource being started on multiple nodes at the same
       time.
