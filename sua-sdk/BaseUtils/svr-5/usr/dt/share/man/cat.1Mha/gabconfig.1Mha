       The  gabconfig  utility is used to set up and maintain the
       configuration of the GAB driver. The GAB driver is  depen-
       dent  on  the  Low  Latency Transport (LLT) protocol which
       must be configured prior to running  gabconfig.   The  GAB
       driver  also requires the MAC Switch Driver (MSW) software
       for partition arbitration.

       The following options are  available  with  the  gabconfig
       command:  Specifies  a  debug-level to enable kernel debug
       messages. The debug-level is a bitmask where each bit cor-
       responds  to  a  module in the GAB driver.  Debug level is
       zero by default.  Specifies a timeout in milliseconds  for
       clients  to  respond to an IOFENCE message before the node
       is halted.  When clients receive an IOFENCE  message  they
       must unregister from the GAB driver within iofence-timeout
       milliseconds to avoid halting the node.  Default is  5000,
       or 5 seconds.  Specifies a timeout in milliseconds for GAB
       to wait for the cluster connectivity  to  stablize  before
       issuing  a new group membership.  This applies during mem-
       bership transitions and is related to the LLT  peer  inac-
       tivity  timeout.  It should be set to the inactivity time-
       out plus the maximum message latency.  The default is 3000
       or  3 seconds, allowing for an LLT peer inactivity timeout
       of 2 seconds and 1 second maximum message latency.   Maxi-
       mum  message  latency in LLT is statistical and is related
       to the retransmission timeout and network drop rate.   One
       second  is  a liberal estimate that should cover most pri-
       vate server-class networks.  Specifies the number of  mes-
       sages  to  buffer  on  both  the transmit and receive side
       before giving a flow control  indication.  This  parameter
       has  a  dramatic effect on broadcast throughput and is set
       by default to the optimal value for server-class  configu-
       rations.   Disables the use of a second network for parti-
       tion arbitration.  By default, the  GAB  driver  will  use
       redundant   network   hardware  to  insure  that  multiple
       instances of the same application group  are  not  formed.
       This  is  done  by  communicating over a remaining network
       link when one link fails and halting nodes until  a  reli-
       able  communication group can be formed.  When this option
       is specified,  the  GAB  driver  will  form  communication
       groups  with  only one network link, exposing the applica-
       tion to network  partitions.   This  option  provides  for
       testing  on  systems  with  limited  hardware  but  is not
       intended for production operation.  Using this option  can
       lead  to data corruption.  Disable heartbeat monitoring of
       user processes for debugging.  User-level clients can reg-
       ister  with  a heartbeat timeout to provide for monitoring
       of the user process.  If the client fails to call into the
       GAB  driver  within  the  heartbeat timeout specified, the

                                                                1

       node is halted.  This flags disables heartbeat  monitoring
       which  is enabled by default.  Configure GAB driver.  When
       -c is specified  all  options  are  set  to  specified  or
       default values. No option values carry forward from a pre-
       vious setting.  Unconfigure GAB driver. The driver may  be
       unconfigured  only  if  all  ports are unregistered on the
       local node. Unregistering clears all  previous  configura-
       tion values.  Displays the GAB driver configuration.  Dis-
       plays all GAB driver port  memberships.   Enables  verbose
       output, disabled by default.
