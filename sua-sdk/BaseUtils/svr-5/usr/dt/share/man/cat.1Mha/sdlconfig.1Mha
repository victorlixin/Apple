       The sdlconfig command is an administrative utility used to
       configure and manage the SDL driver. The SDL  driver  pro-
       vides  a  DLPI  network  interface  to serial tty devices.
       Used in conjunction with MAC switch driver (MSW), the  SDL
       driver  provides a backup slow link to a network for reli-
       able communications.  Use the sdlconfig command to config-
       ure and list SDL interfaces.

       Sdlconfig  configures the SDL driver based on the informa-
       tion in the sdltab file. This file contains  entries  that
       describe  the SDL driver virtual interfaces and the physi-
       cal interfaces that comprise them.

       The argument sdl-device is optional; sdlconfig  will  pro-
       cess the entire sdltab file if it is not present.
