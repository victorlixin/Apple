       The  hvshut command shuts down the Reliant software on one
       or more systems in a cluster. This  command  disables  all
       Reliant  cluster  error detection and recovery routines on
       that system, but does not shut down the operating  system.
       During  Reliant  software shutdown, applications are still
       available to users but are not monitored.  The  amount  of
       time  hvshut  waits  for a successful shutdown is a calcu-
       lated value based on the size of the  cluster.  This  time
       interval  can  be  changed using the RELIANT_SHUT_MIN_WAIT
       environment variable.

       The hvshut command has the highest priority  of  any  com-
       mand.  Shut down the Reliant software on the local system.
       The systems in the cluster are local or remote in relation
       to  where  the command is executed.  Shut down the Reliant
       software on all systems in the cluster.  Force a  shutdown
       of  the Reliant software on the local system.  This option
       forces the configuration monitor to clean up and shut down
       the  Reliant  software on the local system without running
       offline scripts.  File systems remain  mounted  and  disks
       remain configured. Before restarting the cluster, the file
       systems must be unmounted and the disks unconfigured manu-
       ally.   The -f option should be used only after a graceful
       shutdown of the cluster  using  the  -l  option  has  been
       attempted.  Since the -f option skips the offline scripts,
       if they are required  to  assure  the  condition  of  your
       resources, they must be manually started.

       Before  doing  a  hvshut -f on a system, make sure that no
       application is transitioning (or  Busy)  on  that  system.
       The  hvdisp command can be used to determine if any appli-
       cations are busy.
