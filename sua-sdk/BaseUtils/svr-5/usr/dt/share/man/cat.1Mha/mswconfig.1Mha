       The mswconfig command is an administrative utility used to
       configure and manage the MAC switch driver. The MAC switch
       driver combines redundant network connections  (for  exam-
       ple,  one or more Ethernets) and provides a single virtual
       network view to the  applications  using  the  MAC  switch
       driver. If one of the underlying network interfaces fails,
       that network interface is marked as OFFLINE and the appli-
       cation  packets  are  automatically  switched to the other
       ONLINE network interfaces under  that  MAC  switch  driver
       virtual  interface.  Use  the mswconfig command to perform
       the following actions on a MAC switch  interface:  config-
       ure,   unconfigure,   enable/disable   keepalive,   change
       keepalive parameters, and list the current  configuration.

       mswconfig  configures  the  MAC switch driver based on the
       information in the mswtab file. This file contains entries
       that describe the MAC switch driver virtual interfaces and
       the physical interfaces that comprise them.

       The argument msw-device is optional; mswconfig  will  pro-
       cess the entire mswtab file if it is not present.

       The  following  options  are  available with the mswconfig
       comand: Forces keepalive messages to use IEEE 802.3 encap-
       sulation.   The encapsulation format used must be the same
       for each node on a network.  Enables verbose output.  Read
       mswtab  from  standard input.  List the current configura-
       tion of msw-device.   Configure  msw-device.   Unconfigure
       msw-device.   Apply  the  request  to  the physical device
       indicated by phys-device.  Used in  conjunction  with  the
       -c,  -u,  and  -x  options.  phys-device can be either the
       interface number as shown in the -l option, or it  can  be
       the   name   of  the  device  (eg  /dev/ee16_0).   Enables
       keepalive message processing.  Disables keepalive  message
       processing.   Set  the number of missed keepalive messages
       before a link is declared offline.  Set  the  interval  in
       milliseconds  between  keepalive messages.  Enable/disable
       the  specified  link.  Used  primarily  to  simulate   MSW
       failover.
