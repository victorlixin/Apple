       The  floodout  utility is used to generate network traffic
       over a specific  DLPI  network  device.  Its  counterpart,
       floodin,  is used to consume the messages on the receiving
       machine. These utilities provide the  capability  to  test
       and  debug  an  installation  of  the MAC Switch Driver by
       exchanging network packets. Each iteration of the  program
       loop  exchanges  2048  packets and then prints a bandwidth
       estimate.

       The following options are available with the  floodin  and
       floodout  commands: Specify the name of the network device
       to use.  Specify the  DSAP  to  use  in  transmitting  and
       receiving packets.  Specify the message size in bytes. The
       default is 256.  Specify the number of times that a set of
       2048 packets will be sent or received.  Specify the desti-
       nation address for packets generated. The default  is  the
       broadcast address. The format is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.
