       Displays the current status of the peer nodes and the sta-
       tus of the local ports that are in use. The maximum number
       of nodes and ports are shown, as well as  the  local  node
       ID,  the MTU and the SAP.  The local node ID is also indi-
       cated by an asterisk among the other nodes  in  the  list.
       Possible states for a node are: node has not yet been ini-
       tialized node is initialized and  may  connect  trying  to
       resolve  peer node's MAC address node is initiating a con-
       nection to a peer node connection is in progress  node  is
       communicating  with peers node is disconnecting from peers
       The list of local ports in use shows which peer nodes each
       port  is  connected to as well as flow control and closing
       indications, if any.  Displays the current status  of  the
       peer  nodes and their MAC addresses.  Resets the statisti-
       cal counters to zero.
