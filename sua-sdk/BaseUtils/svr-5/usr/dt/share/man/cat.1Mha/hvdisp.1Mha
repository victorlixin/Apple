       The hvdisp command displays the current status and config-
       uration for Reliant cluster resources.  Display the  types
       and current states of all resources.  Send the output to a
       file called output_file.  You can specify this option only
       with  the -a and -S option.  Display a specific subtree or
       branch of the configuration  where  resource_name  is  the
       resource  associated  with the branch.  Display the states
       of resources and update the  screen  every  three  seconds
       whenever a resource state changes.  hvdisp runs until C is
       issued or the Reliant  software  is  shut  down  with  the
       hvshut  command.  Only one invocation of -u can be running
       on the system at a time.  The state of  the  resources  is
       displayed  as they are on the local system.  For the user-
       Application, hvdisp also displays the  following:  If  any
       dependent resource went offline unexpectedly, the state is
       displayed as ChildFaulted.  If it is busy (in the  process
       of  starting  up or shutting down on some system), Busy is
       displayed as well as which system  has  it  busy.   hvdisp
       does  not write to its STDOUT or STDERR.  hvdisp sends the
       command to the main Reliant process that either writes  to
       the  tty from where the hvdisp was issued or to the <file-
       name> if the -o option is specified.   If  the  system  is
       busy,  the  output  may  be created some time after hvdisp
       returns.
