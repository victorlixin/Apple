       The  llttest  utility  is used to test the connectivity of
       the LLT protocol between the nodes in a cluster.  It  uses
       the   user-level  STREAMS  interface  to  the  LLT  stack.
       llttest has  an  interactive  interface  that  facilitates
       sending  and  receiving LLT packets between nodes.  The -p
       option is required to select a LLT port, as  llttest  only
       operates on one port per instance.

       The  syntax  for  the interactive interface is as follows:
       Prepare to receive count messages.   Transmit  count  mes-
       sages to node.  Prepare to receive count messages and pro-
       ceed to forward them to node.  Prepare  to  receive  count
       messages  and  proceed to forward them back to the sender.
       Transmit count unreliable datagram packets to  node.   Set
       the  default  destination  node  to node.  Set the default
       message count to count.  Set the debug level  to  generate
       various degrees of debug message output.  Print out a list
       of the available commands.  Exit the program.

       The following options are available with the llttest  com-
       mand:  Specify the LLT port to use for sending and receiv-
       ing packets.  Specify the size in bytes for the packets to
       be  sent.  Specify that the data in contained in the pack-
       ets should be verified. This option must be used  on  both
       the sender and receiver to be effective.
