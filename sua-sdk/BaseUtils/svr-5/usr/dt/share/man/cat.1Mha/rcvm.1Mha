       The  rcvm  command starts the RCVM (Reliant Cluster Visual
       Manager), the graphical user interface  that  provides  an
       interactive  display  of all Reliant cluster resources and
       their current states. The RCVM allows the user to  manipu-
       late  a  resource,  and maintain the Reliant cluster using
       pull-down menus, commands, and graphic displays.

       The rcvm command is not usually run with any command  line
       options;  default values are appropriate for most configu-
       rations.  The following are valid options: Specify the  IP
       address  of  the  terminal  on which the GUI is to be dis-
       played.  Specify the background color of the object  icons
       displayed  in  the  Objects panel of the top-level window.
       Specify the background color of the operation or  function
       buttons  in the Operations panel or the Functions panel of
       the top-level window.  Specify the background color of the
       object  icons when they are in the Undefined state.  Spec-
       ify the background color of the object icons when they are
       in the Unknown state.  Specify the background color of the
       object icons when they are in the Online  state.   Specify
       the  background color of the object icons when they are in
       the Offline state.  Specify the background  color  of  the
       object  icons when they are in the Faulted state.  Specify
       the background color of the object icons when they are  in
       the  Wait  state.  Specify the path where the pixmap files
       used by rcvm are installed. (Only when the path  is  being
       changed  from  the default path, /usr/lib/X11/pixmaps/Rvm)
       Specify the path where the bitmap files used by  rcvm  are
       installed.  (Only  when the path is being changed from the
       default path, /usr/lib/X11/bitmaps/Rvm) Specify  the  path
       of  the  log file to be used by rcvm.  (Only when changing
       the      default      RCVM      log       file       name,
       /usr/opt/reliant/log/rcvm_process  idlog.   This option is
       used for debugging.)   Specify  whether  the  visual  bell
       should be turned on when any notice/warning/error messages
       are received by rcvm from the configuration monitor; value
       can  be  either  True  or False.  The default is True when
       this option is specified on  the  command  line.   Specify
       whether  to  display  object  icons  in resource images or
       state images; value can  be  either  True  or  False.  The
       default  is True when this option is specified on the com-
       mand line.
