       _spin_destroy  destroys  the spin lock pointed to by lock.
       This includes invalidating lock and freeing any associated
       implementation-allocated dynamic resources.

       Any   user-allocated  dynamic  storage  is  unaffected  by
       _spin_destroy and must be explicitly released by the  pro-
       gram.
