       rmutex_destroy  destroys  the  recursive  mutual exclusion
       lock (rmutex) pointed to by rmutex.  This includes invali-
       dating  the  rmutex and freeing any associated implementa-
       tion-allocated dynamic resources.

       pointer to recursive mutex to be destroyed

       Any user-allocated dynamic storage is unaffected  by  rmu-
       tex_destroy  and  must  be explicitly released by the pro-
       gram.

       rmutex_destroy returns zero for success and an error  num-
       ber for failure.

       If  any  of  the  following  conditions  is detected, rmu-
       tex_destroy returns the  corresponding  value:  rmutex  is
       locked  by  another thread or another thread is waiting to
       acquire  rmutex  invalid  argument  specified  the  rmutex
       pointed to by rmutex was already destroyed
