       barrier_destroy  destroys  the  barrier pointed to by bar-
       rier.  This includes invalidating the barrier and  freeing
       any associated implementation-allocated dynamic resources.

       Any user-allocated dynamic storage is unaffected  by  bar-
       rier_destroy  and  must be explicitly released by the pro-
       gram.

       If  one  of  the  following  conditions  is detected, bar-
       rier_destroy returns the corresponding value: a thread  is
       still waiting at the barrier invalid argument specified
