       pointer to condition variable to be broadcast

       cond_broadcast  wakes up all threads waiting on the condi-
       tion cond.  If more than one thread is waiting, the  order
       of  release  from  the blocked group is scheduling policy-
       specific for bound threads: Bound  threads  have  priority
       over  multiplexed  threads;  then within each category the
       choice of thread is scheduling-policy-specific.

       cond_broadcast has no effect if there are no threads wait-
       ing on cond.

       A  cond_broadcast  will be more reliable if the associated
       mutex used by waiters is held across the call.

       The condition variable denoted  by  cond  must  previously
       have been initialized (see cond_init(3synch)).
