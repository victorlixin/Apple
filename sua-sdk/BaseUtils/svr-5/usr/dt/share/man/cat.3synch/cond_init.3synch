       cond_init initializes the condition variable pointed to by
       cond to be of type type.  Once created, the condition cond
       can  be used any number of times without being re-initial-
       ized.

       In this implementation, a condition variable can  be  ini-
       tialized  statically  if  its  storage is zero-filled.  In
       this case, the condition variable is of type USYNC_THREAD,
       and cond_init need not be called.

RReettuurrnn vvaalluueess
       cond_init returns zero for success and an error number for
       failure.

   EErrrroorrss
       If the following condition is detected, cond_init  returns
       the  corresponding  value: invalid type or NULL cond argu-
       ment specified

WWaarrnniinnggss
       cond_init does not examine the cond argument  before  ini-
       tializing  it.   If cond_init is called more than once for
       the same condition, it will overwrite its  state.   It  is
       the user's responsibility to ensure that cond_init is only
       called once for each condition variable.
