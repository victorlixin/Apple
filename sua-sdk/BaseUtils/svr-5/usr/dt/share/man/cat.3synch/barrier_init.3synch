       barrier_init initializes the blocking barrier  pointed  to
       by  barrier  to  be  of type type and to synchronize count
       threads.  Once initialized, the barrier can  be  used  any
       number of times to synchronize execution of count threads.

       Threads waiting at  a  blocking  barrier  will  block,  or
       sleep, until all count threads arrive at the barrier.

       count is the number of threads that will  be  synchronized
       by  the  barrier.   That  is,  barrier_wait will block any
       calling threads until count threads have reached the  bar-
       rier.

       type can be set to one of the following values: initialize

       barrier_init returns zero for success and an error  number
       for failure.

       A  barrier  should not be re-initialized while threads are
       waiting at the barrier.
