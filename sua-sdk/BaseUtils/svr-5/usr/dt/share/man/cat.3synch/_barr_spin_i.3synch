       _barrier_spin_init  initializes   the   spinning   barrier
       pointed  to by barrier to synchronize count threads.  Once
       initialized, the barrier can be used any number  of  times
       without  being re-initialized, to synchronize execution of
       count threads.

       Threads waiting at a spinning barrier will  busy-wait,  or
       spin, until all count threads arrive at the barrier.

       count is the number of threads that will  be  synchronized
       by  the  barrier.   That  is,  any  threads  calling _bar-
       rier_spin will spin until count threads have  reached  the
       barrier.

       _barrier_spin_init returns zero for success and  an  error
       number for failure.

       If the following condition is detected, _barrier_spin_init
       returns the corresponding value: invalid  argument  speci-

       A  barrier  should not be re-initialized while threads are
       spinning at the barrier.
