       mutex_destroy  destroys  the  mutex  pointed  to by mutex.
       This includes invalidating the mutex and freeing any asso-
       ciated implementation-allocated dynamic resources.

       Any   user-allocated  dynamic  storage  is  unaffected  by
       mutex_destroy and must be explicitly released by the  pro-
       gram.

       If  any  of  the   following   conditions   is   detected,
       mutex_destroy   returns  the  corresponding  value:  mutex
       locked or another thread waiting to acquire mutex  invalid
       argument  specified  the  mutex  denoted  by mutex already
       destroyed
