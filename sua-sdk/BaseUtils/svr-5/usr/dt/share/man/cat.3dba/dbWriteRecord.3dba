       int  dbWriteRecord(       DBConn   *conn,        DBRecord-

       dbWriteRecord writes a record to the  log  database.   The
       header  specified in the call is a DBRecordHeader_t struc-
       ture which contains all of the header information that  is
       to be logged with the record.

       The  data  parameter  specifies the data to be logged with
       the message.  If there is a large amount of event specific
       information  to  be  logged  with  a record, dbWriteRecord
       makes repeated internal calls to the database to add  mul-
       tiple rows with increasing sequence numbers.

       When  is  used  to retrieve a row that contains event spe-
       cific information in excess of  the  maximum  record  size
       supported   by   the  database,  additional  entries  with
       increasing  sequence  numbers  are  extracted   from   the
       database.  In  order to assemble the entire log entry, all
       the rows with matching UniqEventIDs should be gathered  in
       SequenceNumber order.
