       dbConnect  establishes  a  connection  to  a database, and
       returns a connection  ID  that  can  be  passed  to  other
       database  access routines to identify the database connec-
       tion.

   AArrgguummeennttss
       (Input) The host where the  database  server  is  running.
       This  can  either  be  a hostname, or an IP address in dot
       notation (for example, 192.168.24.1). If the  database  is
       running  on  the  local  machine, or the database does not
       support remote connections, this field should  be  set  to
       NULL.   (Input)  The  TCP port number that the database is
       listening on. If the database is listening on the  default
       port  (defined  by  the database) or the database does not
       support remote connections, this field should  be  set  to
       NULL.   (Input) The name of the database that the applica-
       tion wants to access.  (Input) A descriptive name for  the
       connection.   (Input)  Flags affecting the characteristics
       of   the    connection    to    the    database    server.
       DB_EELSD_REMOTE_RESULT  indicates that the database server
       should store the results of a  dbQuery  until  the  client
       asks  for  them  with  dbGetNextRow. DB_EELSD_LOCAL_RESULT
       causes the client to  download  the  entire  result  of  a
       dbQuery.

       If   a  connection  is  successfully  established  to  the
       database, dbConnect returns a pointer to a  DBConn  struc-
       ture.  If an error occurs, dbConnect returns NULL.

       An  application  can  call  to  obtain  the  error message
       returned from the database.
