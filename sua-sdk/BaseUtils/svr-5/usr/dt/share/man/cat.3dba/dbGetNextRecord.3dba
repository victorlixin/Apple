       dbGetNextRecord writes a record to the log database.   The
       header  specified in the call is a DBRecordHeader_t struc-
       ture which will contain all of the header information from
       the record retrieved via dbGetNextRow.

       The  bufp  parameter  specifies a buffer that will contain
       the data for  all  fields  of  type  EELSBuffer_t  in  the
       DBRecordHeader_t.   It  is reccommended that bufp be large
       enough to hold the maximum amount of data  possible  given
       the size of the fields in the database schema.

       When  is  used  to retrieve a row that contains event spe-
       cific information in excess of  the  maximum  record  size
       supported   by   the  database,  additional  entries  with
       increasing  sequence  numbers  are  extracted   from   the
       database.  In  order to assemble the entire log entry, all
       the rows with matching UniqEventIDs should be gathered  in
       SequenceNumber order.

       returns -1.
