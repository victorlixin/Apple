       dbTrace enables tracing for a  specific  database  connec-
       tion,  or  for  all  database connections. When tracing is
       enabled,   debugging    information    is    written    to
       /etc/eels/logs/eelsd.log.

       If  a  NULL  connection  is  passed  to this routine, then
       debugging is enabled on the internal connection that  EELS
       maintains  to the administrative database.  A NULL connec-
       tion also causes the trace level to be set on  all  subse-
       quent connections that are made to any EELS database. This
       provides a means of setting a global trace level  for  all
       connections if dbTrace is called at the begining of a pro-
       gram that uses the EELS database abstraction layer.

       being tracing disabled, and 4 being the highest  debugging
       level.
