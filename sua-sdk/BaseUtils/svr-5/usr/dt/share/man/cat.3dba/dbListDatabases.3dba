       dbListDatabases returns the list of  databases  that  cur-
       rently  exist  in  the  RDBMS  used by EELS.  This call is
       equivalent to using to submit the SQL query "SELECT * FROM
       EELS_Admin WHERE TableName IS NULL".

       The  database  list  can be retrieved by making subsequent
       calls to When  the  application  has  finished  using  the
       pointer  returned  by this routine, it should call to free
       the memory associated with the DBResult structure.

       NULL.
