       dbGetUserPriv returns the user privileges  based  on  host
       and  user  names.   This  routine returns a linked list of
       DBPriv_t structures each corresponding to a set of  privi-
       leges  for  a  host/user  pair.  Multiple  entries  can be
       returned from this routine if wildcards are used for  host
       or  user (that is, passing NULL or any for either of those
       fields).

       The DBPriv_t structure is  defined  in  /usr/include/eels-
       dba.h.  The routine must be called to free the linked list
       that is returned from this routine.

       The word any can be used as a wildcard  for  the  host  or
       user field.
