       ev_suspend  suspends  an event queue from receiving input.
       For example, if an application wants to fork a subshell, a
       call  to  ev_suspend  suspends  events  until the subshell
       returns and the queue is resumed with an  ev_resume  call.
       That  way a process in the subshell can also have an event
       queue.  This is required because the  event  manager  only
       allows one active event queue per terminal or multiscreen.

       This function returns -1 if no event queue is  opened.  It
       returns  -2 if the queue is already suspended. Normally it
       returns zero.
