       ev_init  reads  the  system  event-configuration files and
       initializes the event manager.

       ev_initf reads the system  event-configuration  files  and
       initializes  the  event  manager,  using a file descriptor
       (fd) as argument to specify where the event  queue  should
       be  attached.   The  file  descriptor  (fd) for ev_init is
       always 0.

       This is the first of two steps that a program  follows  to
       obtain  an  event queue.  Devices such as mice or the key-
       board may be read through an event queue.  When ev_init or
       ev_initf  is  called, the configuration files are read and
       checked for syntax. If there is an error or inconsistency,
       ev_init  and  ev_initf  return  an error.  After the event
       manager is initialized, should  be  called  to  obtain  an
       event queue.

       ev_init  and  ev_initf return 0 if they succeed in reading
       the data files and initializing an event queue.  Otherwise
       they return -1.

       ev_init  and  ev_initf  are not part of any currently sup-
       ported standard; they are an extension of  AT&T  System  V
       provided by the Santa Cruz Operation.
