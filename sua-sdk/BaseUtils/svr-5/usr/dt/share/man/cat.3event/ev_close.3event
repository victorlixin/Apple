       ev_close closes the event queue and any event devices cur-
       rently open.  This call takes no arguments.

       An event queue  must  have  been  opened  previously  with
       ev_init and ev_open.

       This  routine  returns  a  negative  number to indicate an
       error.  Making this call before obtaining  an  open  event
       queue is an example of such an error.
