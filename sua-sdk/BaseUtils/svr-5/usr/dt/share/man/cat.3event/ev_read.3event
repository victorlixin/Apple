       ev_read  returns  a pointer to the next event in the queue
       or NULL if the queue is empty. Multiple calls to this rou-
       tine return the same pointer until ev_pop is called.

       An  error  occurs if this routine is called from a program
       without an open event queue.

       This routine returns NULL if there is no event to read  or
       if there is not an open event queue.
