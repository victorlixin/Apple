       ev_setemask sets the event mask on an event queue.  Events
       whose tag is not masked-in are prevented from entering  an
       event  queue.  Event masks are always initialized to allow
       all events.

       The different types of events are:
       ----------------------------------------
       Type   Description
       ----------------------------------------
       R      Reserved
       a      Other Device events
       b      Button events
       c      String events
       d      Relative Locator movement events
       e      Absolute Locator movement events

       The bits that make up the mask number have  the  following
       definitions:
       ---------------------------------------------------------
       R    R  R   R  R   R   R  R   R   R  R   e  d   c   b  a
       ---------------------------------------------------------
       15                                                     0
       ---------------------------------------------------------

       If  there  is  no open event queue, -1 is returned. If the
       new event mask would cause no events to enter  the  queue,
       -2  is  returned  and  the  event mask is not changed. For
       example, on a queue with only  a  mouse,  any  event  mask
       which  did not include D_REL would not allow any events to
       be entered into the queue.
