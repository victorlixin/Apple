       ev_gindev is used in concert with ev_getdev to exclude  or
       later re-include devices from feeding the event queue. The
       argument devinfop contains the pointer to the device to be
       included  or  excluded. The arguments are a pointer to the
       device and EXCLUDE.  The pointer is obtained  through  the
       getdev function.

       EXCLUDE is defined in <mouse.h>.

       This  routine  returns  0 if it succeeds. It returns -1 if
       there is no active event queue. It returns -2 if the  dev-
       info argument does not point to a valid device. It returns
       -3 on attempts to exclude an excluded device, or  attempts
       to  reinclude  an  included  device.  It returns -4 if the
       action argument is invalid.
