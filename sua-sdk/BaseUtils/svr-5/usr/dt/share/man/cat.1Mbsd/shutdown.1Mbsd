       shutdown  provides  an automated procedure to notify users
       when the system is to be shut down.  time  specifies  when
       shutdown  will  bring  the system down; it may be the word
       now (indicating an immediate shutdown), or it may  specify
       a future time in one of two formats: +number and hour:min.
       The first form brings the system down in  number  minutes,
       and  the  second brings the system down at the time of day
       indicated in 24-hour notation.

       At intervals that get closer as the apocalypse approaches,
       warning messages are displayed at terminals of all logged-
       in users, and of users who  have  remote  mounts  on  that
       machine.

       At  shutdown  time  a message is written to the system log
       daemon, containing the time of shutdown, the instigator of
       the  shutdown, and the reason.  Then a terminate signal is
       sent to init, which brings the system down to  init  state
       1.
