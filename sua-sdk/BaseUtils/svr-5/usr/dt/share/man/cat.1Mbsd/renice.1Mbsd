       The renice command alters the scheduling priority  of  one
       or  more  running processes.  By default, the processes to
       be affected are specified by their process IDs.   priority
       is the new priority value.

       Specify  a list of process IDs.  Specify a list of process
       group IDs.  The processes in the specified process  groups
       have their scheduling priority altered.  Specify a list of
       user IDs or usernames.  All processes owned by  each  user
       have their scheduling altered.

       Users  other  than  the privileged user may only alter the
       priority of processes they own, and can only monotonically
       increase  their nice value within the range 0 to 20.  This
       prevents overriding administrative fiats.  The  privileged
       user  may  alter  the  priority of any process and set the
       priority to any value in the range -20 to 20.  Useful pri-
       orities are: 19 (the affected processes will run only when
       nothing else in the system wants to), 0 (the base schedul-
       ing  priority)  and  any negative value (to make things go
       very fast).

       If only the priority is  specified,  the  current  process
       (alternatively, process group or user) is used.

       If  you  make the priority very negative, then the process
       cannot be interrupted.

       To regain control you must make the priority greater  than
       zero.

       Users  other  than  the  privileged  user  cannot increase
       scheduling priorities of their own processes, even if they
       were  the  ones that decreased the priorities in the first
       place.

       The priocntl command subsumes the function of renice.
