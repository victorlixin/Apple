       The catman command creates the preformatted version of the
       online  manual  from the input files.  Each manual page is
       examined and any page for which the  preformatted  version
       is  missing  or  out of date is recreated.  If any changes
       are made, catman recreates the whatis database.  See

       The following options are available: do not (re)create the
       whatis  database  (in  /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man) displays
       the action to be taken, but does not  perform  the  action
       only create the whatis database (no manual reformatting is
       done) update the manual pages  located  in  the  specified
       directory   (/usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man   by  default)  use
       mac_file instead of the standard -man macro package

       If catman receives a single option  that  does  not  start
       with  a  ``-'',  catman  interprets it as a list of manual
       page sections in which to look.  For example,  catman  123
       only  updates  manual  sections 1, 2, and 3.  You can also
       update multiple sections by separating the  section  names
       with  colons (:) on the command line.  For example, catman
       1:2:1M updates manual sections 1, 2, and 1M.

       catman  assumes  that  manual  pages  are  named  with  an
       alphanumeric  extension,  such  as  man.1, nroff.1bsd, and
       adduser.1M.

       To add new pages to the cat  directories  and  update  the
       whatis  database:  Save  the  original whatis database: cd
       /usr/lib/scohelp/LANG/man cp whatis whatis.bak where  LANG
       is  the  locale  name  of the man page's content language.
       Place the new pages in  the  appropriate  man  directories
       with  appropriate  names,  such as man.1bsd/nroff.1bsd and
       man.1M/adduser.1M.  Run catman to nroff the pages into the
       appropriate  cat  directories  and  create  a  new  whatis
       database: catman -p catman Sort the original and  the  new
       whatis  files together into a new whatis database: sort -o
       whatis -df whatis whatis.bak

       This error indicates that the file outside the parentheses
       is missing, and is referred to by the  file  inside  them:
       man?/xxx.?  (.so'ed  from  man?/yyy.?):  No  such  file or
       directory This error indicates  that  catman  only  allows
       references to filenames that are relative to the directory
       /usr/man: target of .so in man?/xxx.? must be relative  to
       /usr/man  This  is  a  harmless warning message indicating
       that one of the directories catman normally looks  for  is
       missing: opendir:man?: No such file or directory This is a
       harmless  warning  message  indicating  that  catman  came
       across an empty directory: *.*: No such file or directory
