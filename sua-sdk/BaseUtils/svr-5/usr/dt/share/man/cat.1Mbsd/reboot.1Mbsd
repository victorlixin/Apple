       reboot  restarts  the  kernel.   The kernel is loaded into
       memory by the PROM monitor, which transfers control to it.

       Although  reboot  can be run by the privileged user at any
       time, is normally used first to warn all users  logged  in
       of the impending loss of service.  See for details.

       reboot  performs a operation on the disks, and then a mul-
       tiuser reboot is initiated.  See for details.

       Executing reboot -l logs the reboot to the system log dae-
       mon,  and places a shutdown record in the login accounting
       file /var/adm/wtmp.  These actions are inhibited if the -n
       or -q options are present.

       Dump  system  core  before rebooting.  This option is pro-
       vided for compatibility,  but  is  not  supported  by  the
       underlying  call.   Logs a message to the system log indi-
       cating who rebooted the system.  Avoid the It can be  used
       if  a  disk  or the processor is on fire.  Quick.  Reboots
       quickly and ungracefully, without first shutting down run-
       ning processes.  These arguments are accepted for compati-
       bility, but are ignored by reboot.  See for details.
