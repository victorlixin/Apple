       lpc  controls the operation of the printer, or of multiple
       printers.  lpc commands can be used to  start  or  stop  a
       printer,  disable  or  enable  a printer's spooling queue,
       rearrange the order of jobs in a  queue,  or  display  the
       status  of each printer--along with its spooling queue and
       printer daemon.

       With no arguments, lpc runs interactively, prompting  with
       `lpc>'.   If  arguments  are  supplied, lpc interprets the
       first as a command to execute; each subsequent argument is
       taken as a parameter for that command.  The standard input
       can be redirected so that lpc reads commands from a  file.

       Commands  may  be abbreviated to an unambiguous substring.
       Note: the printer parameter is specified just by the  name
       of  the printer (as lw), not as you would specify it to or
       (not as -Plw).  Display a short description of  each  com-
       mand  specified  in the argument list, or, if no arguments
       are given, a list of the recognized  commands.   Terminate
       an  active  spooling  daemon on the local host immediately
       and then disable printing  (preventing  new  daemons  from
       being  started  by  for the specified printers.  The abort
       command can only be used by a privileged user.  Remove all
       files  created  in  the spool directory by the daemon from
       the specified printer queue(s) on the local machine.   The
       clean command can only be used by a privileged user.  Turn
       the specified  printer  queues  off.   This  prevents  new
       printer jobs from being entered into the queue by The dis-
       able command can only be used by a privileged user.   Turn
       the  specified printer queue off, disable printing and put
       message in the printer status file.  The message does  not
       need  to  be  quoted,  the remaining arguments are treated
       like This is normally used to take a printer down and  let
       others  know  why  indicates  that the printer is down, as
       does the status command).  Enable spooling  on  the  local
       queue for the listed printers, so that can put new jobs in
       the spool queue.  The enable command can only be used by a
       privileged  user.   Exit from lpc.  Attempt to start a new
       printer daemon.  This is useful when some abnormal  condi-
       tion causes the daemon to die unexpectedly leaving jobs in
       the queue.  This command can be run by any  user.   Enable
       printing and start a spooling daemon for the listed print-
       ers.  The start command can only be used by  a  privileged
       user.   Display  the  status  of daemons and queues on the
       local machine.  This command can be run by any user.  Stop
       a spooling daemon after the current job completes and dis-
       able printing.  The stop command can only  be  used  by  a
       privileged  user.  Move the print job(s) specified by job#
       or those job(s) belonging to user to the top (head) of the
       printer  queue.   The  topq  command can only be used by a

       The  abbreviation you typed matches more than one command.
       You typed a command or abbreviation that  was  not  recog-
       nized.   You  used  a  command can be executed only by the
       privileged user.  The printer was not found in the  System
       V LP database.  Usually this is a typing mistake; however,
       it may indicate that the printer does  not  exist  on  the
       system.  Use `lptstat -p' to find the reason.  The connec-
       tion to lpsched on the local machine failed.  This usually
       means  the printer server started at boot time has died or
       is  hung.    Check   if   the   printer   spooler   daemon
       /usr/lib/lp/lpsched  is  running.  These indicate that the
       LP print service has been stopped.  Get help from the sys-
       tem administrator.  It is likely there is an error in this
       software.  Get help from system administrator.
