       The ndp program displays and modifies the IPv6-to-hardware
       address translation tables used by the IPv6 neighbor  dis-
       covery  protocol  (NDP).  (ndp performs an analogous func-
       tion to that of the command in IPv4.)

       If no options are  specified,  ndp  displays  the  current
       entry  for  hostname. The host may be specified by name or
       IPv6 address.

       ndp understands the following options: Display all current
       NDP  table  entries.   Delete an entry from the NDP table.
       Specify the index of the interface  to  use  when  an  NDP
       table  entry is added with the -s flag (useful with local-
       link interfaces).  Display numerical network addresses  as
       numbers  instead of attempting to resolve them into domain
       names. This greatly speeds up the performance of  the  ndp
       command.  Create an NDP entry for hostname with the speci-
       fied hardware address. The address must be entered as  six
       colon-separated hexadecimal bytes.  The entry is permanent
       unless the keyword temp is specified.

       List the entries in the NDP table:  ndp  -a  This  command
       produces  output such as: e-crankv6 (::903:9182) at link#2
       0:20:af:db:b8:cf                              e-crankv6-11
       (fe80::100:0:0220:afff:fedb:b8cf)         at        link#2
       0:20:af:db:b8:cf Delete the entry for e-crankv6-11: ndp -d
       e-crankv6-11  This  command  produces  output  such as: e-
       crankv6-11 (fe80::100:0:0220:afff:fedb:b8cf) deleted
