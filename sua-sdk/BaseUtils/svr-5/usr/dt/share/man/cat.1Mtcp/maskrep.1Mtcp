       maskreply  checks  the kernel variable icmp_answermask; if
       it is set, then for  each  interface  maskreply  sends  an
       unsolicited  ICMP netmask reply to the address returned by
       SIOCGIFBRDADDR using the netmask returned  by  SIOCGIFNET-
       MASK.  maskreply  will  send a mask reply out an interface
       only if all of the following are true: the interface is in
       address family AF_INET, the interface is up, the interface
       supports broadcasts, and the interface  is  not  point-to-
       point.

       A  host that acts as an authority for netmasks is required
       by RFC 1122 to broadcast an ICMP subnetmask reply when the
       host  comes  up. This requirement can be satisfied by exe-
       cuting maskreply in /etc/inet/config.
