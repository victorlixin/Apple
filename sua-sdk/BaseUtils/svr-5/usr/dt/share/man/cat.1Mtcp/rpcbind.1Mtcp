       rpcbind is a server that converts RPC program numbers into
       universal addresses. It must be running to make RPC calls.

       When  an  RPC  service is started, it will tell rpcbind at
       what address it is listening, and what RPC program numbers
       it  is  prepared to serve. When a client wishes to make an
       RPC call to a given program number, it will first  contact
       rpcbind  on  the  server  machine to determine the address
       where RPC packets should be sent.

       rpcbind permits partial success. That is, if it can  start
       on  at  least one loopback provider it will continue, even
       if it fails on the other loopback providers and on all  of
       the non-loopback providers like TCP and UDP.

       rpcbind  takes  the  following  options:  Print  debugging
       information for each of the visible transport providers in
       /etc/netconfig.   Do  not print error messages, except for
       messages  associated  with  fatal  errors  during  rpcbind
       startup.

       Normally,  standard  RPC servers are started by port moni-
       tors, so rpcbind must be started before port monitors  are
       invoked.   If  rpcbind  fails  to  start  on  a  transport
       provider listed in the file /etc/netconfig,  it  issues  a
       warning  message about the problem provider, then attempts
       to start itself on the remaining providers.

       rpcbind is restricted to users with the root user ID.

       If rpcbind crashes, all RPC servers must be restarted.

       If the rpcbind daemon fails to  start,  the  name  of  the
       machine may be different from that in the /etc/net/*/hosts
       files. This can occur if the machine name is changed  with
       the command.

       To  see if rpcbind is running, enter nfsping -o rpcbind If
       a message is displayed that states rpcbind is not running,
       check  the  name of the system (uname -n) with the entries
       in the /etc/net/*/hosts files, and see if they match.

       If they do not  match,  your  machine  has  had  its  name
       changed  with  the uname command, and the hostname entries
       in the /etc/net/*/hosts files must be manually updated.

       For example, if the machine's hostname was hulk (use uname

                                                                1

       -n), the first entry in each of the /etc/net/*/hosts files
       should look like: hulk    hulk If the first entry in  each
       of  the  /etc/net/*/hosts files do not match the machine's
       hostname,  you  must  update  the  first  entry   in   the
       /etc/net/*/hosts files, and restart the rpcbind daemon. To
       restart rpcbind, enter: /usr/sbin/rpcbind
