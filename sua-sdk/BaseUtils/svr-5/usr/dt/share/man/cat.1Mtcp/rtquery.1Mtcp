       rtquery  is used to query a RIP network routing daemon, or
       for its routing table by sending a request  or  poll  com-
       mand.   The  routing  information  in any routing response
       packets returned is  displayed  numerically  and  symboli-
       cally.

       By default, rtquery uses the request command.  When the -p
       option is specified, rtquery uses  the  poll  command,  an
       extension  to  the RIP protocol supported by When querying
       gated, the poll command is preferred to the  request  com-
       mand.  This is because the response to the poll command is
       not subject to Split Horizon and/or Poisoned Reverse,  and
       because  some  versions of gated do not answer the request
       command. routed does not answer the poll command,  but  it
       recognizes  requests  coming  from  rtquery and so answers
       completely.

       rtquery can also be used to turn  tracing  on  or  off  in
       routed.

       rtquery  understands  the  following options: Display only
       the numeric network and host numbers.   Normally,  network
       and  host  numbers  are  displayed  both  symbolically and
       numerically.  Use the poll command to request full routing
       information  from This is an extension to the RIP protocol
       supported by gated.  Query using RIP version 1 instead  of
       RIP  version  2.  Change the delay for an answer from each
       host.  By default,  each  host  is  given  15  seconds  to
       respond.   Ask  about the route to destination addr.  Send
       the query with the indicated cleartext  or  MD5  password.
       Change  the  tracing  level  of according to the specified
       operation, op.  Requests from processes which are not run-
       ning  with UID 0 or which are on distant networks are gen-
       erally ignored by the daemon except for a message  in  the
       system  log.  ignores these debugging requests.  op is one
       of the following operations: Turn on tracing to the speci-
       fied  trace  file.  The file must have been specified when
       the daemon was started or it must have the same name as an
       existing  file.   Increase  the debugging level.  Turn off
       tracing.  Dump the daemon's routing table to  the  current
       trace file.
