       The  netdate  command  notifies  that  the system date has
       changed.  If the local time server is a  master,  it  will
       notify all of the slaves that the time has changed.  If it
       is a slave, it will request that  the  master  update  the
       time.

       netdate  should be run whenever a privileged user sets the
       date with A shell script such as the  following  could  be
       used  to  do  both  automatically.   :  #  #  mv /bin/date
       /bin/s5date # install as  /bin/date  #  PATH=/bin:/usr/bin
       s5date $* netdate
