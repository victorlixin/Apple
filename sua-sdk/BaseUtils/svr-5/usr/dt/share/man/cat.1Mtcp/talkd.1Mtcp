       talkd  is  the  server  that notifies a user that somebody
       else wants to initiate  a  conversation.   It  acts  as  a
       repository  of  invitations,  responding  to  requests  by
       clients wishing to rendezvous to hold a conversation.

       In normal operation, a talk client initiates a  rendezvous
       by  sending  a  CTL_MSG to the server of type LOOK_UP (see
       the  protocols/talkd.h  header  file).   This  causes  the
       server  to  search  its  invitation  tables to check if an
       invitation currently exists for the client.  If the lookup
       fails,  the  caller  then sends an ANNOUNCE message.  This
       causes the server to  broadcast  an  announcement  on  the
       callee's  login ports requesting contact.  When the callee
       responds, the local server first uses the recorded invita-
       tion  to  respond with the appropriate rendezvous address.
       Then, the caller and callee client  programs  establish  a
       stream  connection  through  which  the conversation takes
       place.

       otalkd is an older version of talkd.  otalkd  supports  an
       architecture-dependent   version  of  the  talk  protocol,
       whereas talkd supports an architecture-independent version
       of the talk protocol.  Since the two protocols use differ-
       ent UDP ports, it is permissible to configure inetd to run
       both versions simultaneously (this is the default configu-
       ration).  When a talk request is  received,  the  user  is
       instructed to run either talk or otalk, depending on which
       protocol is being used by the remote user.
