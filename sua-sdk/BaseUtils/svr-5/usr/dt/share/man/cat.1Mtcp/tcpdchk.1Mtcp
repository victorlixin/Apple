       tcpdchk   examines  your  tcp  wrapper  configuration  and
       reports all potential and real problems it can  find.  The
       program   examines  the  tcpd  access  control  files  (by
       default,    these    are     /etc/inet/hosts.allow     and
       /etc/inet/hosts.deny),  and  compares the entries in these
       files against entries in the inetd  network  configuration
       file.

       Among  the  problems that tcpdchk reports are non-existent
       pathnames; services that appear  in  tcpd  access  control
       rules,  but  are  not  controlled  by  tcpd; services that
       should not be wrapped; non-existent  host  names  or  non-
       internet   address  forms;  occurrences  of  host  aliases
       instead of official host names; hosts with a  name/address
       conflict; inappropriate use of wildcard patterns; inappro-
       priate use of NIS netgroups or references to  non-existent
       NIS  netgroups;  references  to  non-existent options; and
       invalid arguments to options.

       Where possible, tcpdchk provides a helpful  suggestion  to
       fix the problem.

   OOppttiioonnss
       tcpdchk  understands  the following options: Report access
       control rules that permit access without an explicit ALLOW
       keyword.   Examine hosts.allow and hosts.deny files in the
       current directory instead of the  default  ones.   Specify
       this  option  if tcpdchk is unable to find your inetd.conf
       network configuration file, or when you suspect  that  the
       program  uses the wrong one.  Display the contents of each
       access control rule. Daemon  lists,  client  lists,  shell
       commands and options are shown in a pretty-printed format.
       This makes it easier for you  to  spot  any  discrepancies
       between what you want and what the program understands.
