       ifconfig assigns an address to a network interface  and/or
       configures network interface parameters.  ifconfig must be
       used at boot time to define the network  address  of  each
       interface  present  on a machine; it may also be used at a
       later time to redefine an  interface's  address  or  other
       operational parameters.

       The interface argument is a string catenated from the name
       of the network driver and its unit number (n).  These  are
       some  examples: MDI drivers DLPI drivers ODI drivers loop-
       back drivers An interface  may  receive  transmissions  in
       differing  protocols,  each  of which may require separate
       naming schemes. The address_family provides for specifying
       a  family  of protocols, and this specification may change
       the interpretation of the remaining  arguments.  Currently
       only inet for Version 4 of the Internet Protocol family is
       supported. This is the default value.

       For the Internet Protocol family, the address is either  a
       host  name present in the database, or an Internet address
       expressed in dot notation.  The remote_address  need  only
       be  specified to identify the address of the correspondent
       on the other end of a SLIP or PPP link.

       Displays  information  about  all  configured  interfaces.
       Execute  slink  to  link  the specified interface into the
       stack.  This will only be done if  the  interface  is  not
       already  linked  when  ifconfig tries to set the interface
       address.

       This option is only used  when  TCP  is  started.   It  is
       required  for  a small number of network adapters to which
       an interface cannot be linked until  is running and avail-
       able  to download microcode to the adapter when the driver
       is opened.

       ifconfig understands the following commands: Establish  an
       additional  network  address  for this interface.  This is
       useful when packets need to be received that are addressed
       to  a  defunct  network  address,  or for creating virtual
       domains on a host.  Remove the  specified  alias.   Enable
       the  use  of  the  Address  Resolution Protocol in mapping
       between network level addresses and link  level  addresses
       (default).  This  is  currently  implemented  for  mapping
       between Internet addresses and  Ethernet  addresses.  This

                                                                1

       option  is not applicable in the STREAMS environment.  Use
       of arp for an interface is  specified  in  the  /etc/strcf
       file.   The  arp  driver  will  be opened when the STREAMS
       stack is built.  Disable the use of the Address Resolution
       Protocol.   (inet only) Specify the address to use to rep-
       resent broadcasts to the network.  The  default  broadcast
       address  is  the  address  with  a  host  part of all 1's.
       Enable packet logging of IP datagrams  on  PPP  interfaces
       (ppp0,  ppp1,  and  so  on).  If n is set to 1, logging is
       enabled. If set to 0, logging is disabled  (the  default).
       When  enabled,  the IP protocol support module will decode
       IP datagrams containing UDP datagrams or TCP segments  and
       write  this  information  to  the  PPP  log  file (usually
       /var/adm/log/ppp.log).  Enable driver dependent  debugging
       code;  usually, this turns on extra console error logging.
       n specifies the debugging level.  A level of 0  turns  off
       debugging.   Mark  an interface down. When an interface is
       marked down, the system will not attempt to transmit  mes-
       sages  through that interface.  If possible, the interface
       will be reset to disable reception as well.   This  action
       does  not automatically disable routes using the interface
       and it does not break (hang up)  the  physical  connection
       for  SLIP  and  PPP links.  Enable the first link-specific
       parameter.  Disable  the  first  link-specific  parameter.
       Enable  the  second  link-specific parameter.  Disable the
       second link-specific parameter.  Enable  the  third  link-
       specific   parameter.   Disable  the  third  link-specific
       parameter.  Set the routing metric of the interface to  n,
       default 0.  The routing metric is used by the routing dae-
       mon Higher metrics have the effect of making a route  less
       favorable;  metrics  are counted as additional hops to the
       destination network or host.   Set  the  Maximum  Transfer
       Unit  (MTU)  size  of the interface to n.  This should not
       normally be done except for debugging purposes.  Note that
       no  validity  checking  is  performed on the specified MTU
       value; this means that the unwary administrator can  raise
       the  MTU of an interface to a value larger than allowed by
       the hardware.  (inet only) Specify how much of the address
       to reserve for subdividing networks into sub-networks. The
       mask includes the network part of the  local  address  and
       the subnet part, which is taken from the host field of the
       address. The mask can be specified as a single hexadecimal
       number  with  a  leading  0x, with a dot-notation Internet
       address, or with a pseudo-network name listed in the  net-
       work  table The mask contains 1's for the bit positions in
       the 32-bit address which are to be used  for  the  network
       and  subnet  parts,  and  0's  for the host part. The mask
       should contain at least the standard network portion,  and
       the  subnet  field  should  be contiguous with the network
       portion.  Enable the one-packet mode  of  operation  (used
       for  interfaces  that cannot handle back-to-back packets).
       The keyword onepacket must  be  followed  by  two  numeric
       parameters:  size specifies the small packet size in bytes
       and count specifies the small packet threshold.  If  small

                                                                2

       packet  detection  is  not desired, these values should be
       zero. See for an explanation of one-packet mode.   Disable
       one-packet   mode.   Tune  interface-specific  performance
       parameters.  The keyword perf must be  followed  by  three
       numeric parameters: Specifies the size in bytes of the TCP
       receive window.  Specifies the size in bytes  of  the  TCP
       send  window.   If set to 0, TCP will truncate the size of
       each segment to a multiple of  1KB  that  will  fit  in  a
       frame.  If set to 1, TCP will will use all available space
       in a frame for each segment.

       If TCP large window scaling is enabled (see rfc1323),  the
       maximum  possible  value  of  recv_size  and  send_size is
       1073725440 ((2^16-1)*2^14) bytes.   If  TCP  large  window
       scaling  is  disabled (see -rfc1323), the maximum value is
       65535 (2^16-1) bytes.  Turn on TCP  large  window  scaling
       and timestamps (see RFC 1323) for an interface.

       Large  window scaling is recommended for long fat networks
       (LFNs) which have a capacity (defined as the bandwidth  of
       the network in bytes per second times the round-trip delay
       in seconds) that is greater than 65,535 bytes.  The  sizes
       of  the TCP receive and send windows (configured using the
       perf command) should be set equal to the capacity up to  a
       maximum value of 1,073,725,440 ((2^16-1)*2^14) bytes.

       Timestamps  protect  against wrapped sequence numbers when
       the time taken to transmit 2^32 (4,294,967,296)  bytes  of
       data  on  a  network is less than the value of the maximum
       segment lifetime (MSL).  Timestamps should be  enabled  if
       the  product  of the bandwidth of the network in bytes per
       second multiplied by  the  MSL  in  seconds  has  a  value
       greater  than 2^32.)  The default MSL value is 120 seconds
       (defined as half the value of the tcp_2msl parameter).

       By  default,  large  window  scaling  and  timestamps  are
       enabled  on  all  interfaces  provided  that  the inconfig
       tcp_do_rfc1323 parameter  is  set  to  1.   This  behavior
       should  be  turned off using the -rfc1323 command for SLIP
       and PPP interfaces that use header compression.  Turn  off
       TCP  large window scaling and timestamps (RFC 1323) for an
       interface.  This should be  specified  for  SLIP  and  PPP
       interfaces if they use header compression.  Mark an inter-
       face up.  This may be used to enable an interface after an
       ifconfig  down.  It happens automatically when setting the
       first address on an interface.  If the interface was reset
       when  previously  marked down, the hardware will be reini-
       tialized.
