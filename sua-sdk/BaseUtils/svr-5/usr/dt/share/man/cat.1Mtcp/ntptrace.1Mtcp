       ntptrace determines where a given  Network  Time  Protocol
       (NTP)  server gets its time from by following the chain of
       NTP servers back to their master time source.  If given no
       arguments, it starts with ``localhost.''

       Here is an example of the output from ntptrace: % ntptrace
       localhost: stratum 4,  offset  0.0019529,  synch  distance
       0.144135  server2.bozo.com:  stratum  2, offset 0.0124263,
       synch  distance  0.115784  usnh.edu:  stratum  1,   offset
       0.0019298,  synch  distance 0.011993, refid 'WWVB' On each
       line, the fields are (left to right): the  host  name  the
       host's  stratum  the time offset between that host and the
       local host (as measured by ntptrace; this is why it is not
       always  zero  for ``localhost'') the host's ``synchroniza-
       tion distance'' (synchronization distance is a measure  of
       the accuracy of the clock's time).  the reference clock ID
       (only for stratum-1 servers) All times are given  in  sec-
       onds.  Synchronization  distance is a measure of the accu-
       racy of the clock's time.

       names  and  gives  Host IP addresses instead.  This may be
       necessary if a nameserver is down.   sets  the  number  of
