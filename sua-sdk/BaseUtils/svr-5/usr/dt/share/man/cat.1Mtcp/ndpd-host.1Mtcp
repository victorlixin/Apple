       The  ndpd-host daemon manages aspects of the Neighbor Dis-
       covery Protocol (NDP) that are not under  the  control  of
       the  kernel: router discovery, prefix discovery, parameter
       discovery and redirects.  ndpd-host deals with the default
       route,  including  default  router,  default interface and
       default interface address.

       ndpd-host understands the following options: (Debug)  Dis-
       play  exceptional  conditions  and dump.  Timestamp logged
       messages.  Log all interesting events (via the daemon.info
       action in syslog and the console).

       ndpd-host  understands  IEEE,  PPP, and CTI point-to-point
       interfaces.  ndpd-host  exchanges  packets  on  all  known
       active (up) interfaces which have a link-local address. It
       can also detect when an interface's status changes.  If an
       interface goes down or loses its link-local address, ndpd-
       host stops NDP processing on the interface.  If an  inter-
       face comes up, ndpd-host starts NDP processing for it.

       IEEE  interfaces  are  configured  using the command.  PPP
       interfaces are configured using the pppd daemon  which  is
       controlled  using  the command.  Token negotiation defines
       the link-local addresses.  In order to send Router  Adver-
       tisements over a CTI-configured tunnel, it must have local
       and distant link-local addresses.   For  all  active  (up)
       point-to-point  interfaces,  ndpd-host  configures a local
       route via lo0 for local addresses.

       The operation of ndpd-host may be modified by  sending  it
       one  of  the  following signals: Dump the current state of
       ndpd-host to syslog or stdout.  Make  ndpd-host  clean  up
       and exit.  Turn on verbose mode.  Turn off verbose mode.
