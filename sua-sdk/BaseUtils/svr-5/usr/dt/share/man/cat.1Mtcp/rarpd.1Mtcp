       The rarpd command starts a daemon that responds to Reverse
       Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) requests.   The  daemon
       forks  a  copy of itself that runs in background.  It must
       be run as root.

       RARP is used by machines at boot time  to  discover  their
       Internet  Protocol (IP) address.  The booting machine pro-
       vides its Ethernet address  in  a  RARP  request  message.
       Using the ethers and hosts databases, rarpd maps this Eth-
       ernet address into the corresponding IP address  which  it
       returns  to  the booting machine in an RARP reply message.
       The booting machine must be listed in both  databases  for
       rarpd  to  locate  its IP address.  rarpd does not issue a
       reply if it fails to locate an IP address.

       In the first usage of rarpd shown in the ``Synopsis'' sec-
       tion,  the  device argument names the network interface on
       which rarpd is to listen for requests.  device  takes  the
       form  ``nameUNIT''  form  used by The hostname argument is
       used to obtain the IP address of  the  interface.   An  IP
       address  in  dotted-decimal notation may be used for host-
       name.  If hostname is omitted, the address of  the  inter-
       face  will  be obtained from the kernel.  In this usage of
       the command, rarpd must be run separately for each  inter-
       face  on  which RARP service is to be supported.  A router
       may   invoke   rarpd   multiple   times,   for    example:
       /usr/sbin/in.rarpd  wd0  host /usr/sbin/in.rarpd wd1 host-
       backbone In the second usage of rarpd shown in the  ``Syn-
       opsis''  section,  the -a option of rarpd locates all net-
       work interfaces present on the system and starts a  daemon
       process for each one that supports RARP.

       The  -d  option  enables printing of debugging information
       the standard error output.
