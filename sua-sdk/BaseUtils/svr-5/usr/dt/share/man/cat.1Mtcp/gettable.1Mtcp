       gettable  is a simple program used to obtain the NIC stan-
       dard host tables from a ``nicname'' server. The  indicated
       host  is queried for the tables. The tables, if retrieved,
       are placed in the file outfile or by default, hosts.txt.

       The -v option will get just the version number instead  of
       the  complete  host  table  and put the output in the file
       outfile or by default, hosts.ver.

       gettable operates by opening a TCP connection to the  port
       indicated  in the service specification for ``nicname''. A
       request is then made for ``ALL'' names and  the  resultant
       information is placed in the output file.

       gettable  is  best  used  in  conjunction with the program
       which converts the NIC standard file format to  that  used
       by the network library lookup routines.
