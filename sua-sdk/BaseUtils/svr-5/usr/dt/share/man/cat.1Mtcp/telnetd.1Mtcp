       The telnetd command is a server which supports the  Inter-
       net  standard TELNET virtual terminal protocol. telnetd is
       invoked by the Internet server (see  when  it  receives  a
       request to connect to the TELNET port (see

       The  options  are as follows: Cause telnetd to refuse con-
       nections from addresses that cannot be mapped back into  a
       symbolic name via the routine.  Normally, telnetd displays
       the system release, hostname, and terminal port  prior  to
       the login prompt.  This option stops telnetd from display-
       ing this information.  Disable keepalive  messages.   Used
       for  debugging  purposes.  This allows telnet to print out
       debugging information to the connection, thus enabling the
       user  to see what telnetd is doing.  debug_mode can be one
       of the following: Exercise client  (not  currently  imple-
       mented).   Display the received data stream.  Print infor-
       mation about the negotiation of the TELNET options.   Dis-
       play  data  passed  to  the  pseudo-terminal.   Print  the
       options information, as well as some  additional  informa-
       tion  about  what  processing  is  going  on.  Specify the
       interval (in  seconds)  between  keepalive  probes  if  no
       response  is  received.   Specify the number of unanswered
       keepalive probes that will be sent prior to  dropping  the
       connection.   Specify the time (in seconds) that a connec-
       tion must be idle before the first keepalive probe will be
       sent.   Specify  the size of the field in the utmpx struc-
       ture that holds the remote hostname. If the resolved host-
       name  is longer than len, the dotted decimal value will be
       used instead.  This allows hosts with long hostnames  that
       overflow  this field to be uniquely identified. Specifying
       a length of 0 indicates that only dotted decimal addresses
       should be put into the utmpx file.  Start up telnetd manu-
       ally, instead of through If started  up  in  this  manner,
       port may be specified to run telnetd on this alternate TCP
       port number.

       The telnetd command operates by allocating a pseudo-termi-
       nal  device for a client, thereby creating a login process
       which has the slave side of the pseudo-terminal serving as
       stdin, stdout, and stderr.  telnetd manipulates the master
       side of the pseudo-terminal, implementing the TELNET  pro-
       tocol and parsing characters between the remote client and
       the login process.

       When a TELNET session is started up, telnetd sends  TELNET
       options  to  the client side, indicating a willingness to:
       do remote echo of characters suppress go ahead  do  remote
       flow  control  receive  terminal  type information receive
       terminal speed information receive window size information

                                                                1

       from  the  remote  client If the remote client is willing,
       the remote terminal type will be propagated to  the  envi-
       ronment  of the created login process. The pseudo-terminal
       allocated to the client will be configured to  operate  in
       cooked mode, with TAB3 and ICRNL enabled (see

       The  telnetd  command is willing to do: echo, binary, sup-
       press go ahead, and timing mark.

       The telnetd command is also willing  to  have  the  remote
       client  do:  binary, terminal type, terminal speed, window
       size, toggleflow control, environment, Xdisplay  location,
       and suppress go ahead.

       Transport-level  keepalive messages are enabled unless the
       -n option is  present.   The  use  of  keepalive  messages
       allows  sessions  to be timed out if the client crashes or
       becomes unreachable.

       The default keepalive values corresponding to the  -K,  -N
       and -k options are controlled by the parameters tcp_keepi-
       dle  (7200  seconds),  tcp_keepintvl  (75  seconds),   and
       tcp_nkeep  (8).  These can be tuned on a system-wide basis
       using These options exist solely to provide finer  control
       of keepalives on a per-application basis.

       Some TELNET commands are only partially implemented.

       Because of bugs in the original 4.2 BSD version of telnet,
       telnetd performs some unreliable protocol exchanges to try
       to  discover  if  the remote client is, in fact, a 4.2 BSD
       telnet.

       Binary mode has no common  interpretation  except  between
       similar operating systems ( in this case).

       The  terminal  type  name  received from the remote client
       will be converted into lowercase.

       telnetd never sends TELNET go ahead commands.
