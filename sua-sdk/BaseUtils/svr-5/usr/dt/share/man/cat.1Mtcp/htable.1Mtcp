       htable  is used to convert host files in the format speci-
       fied in Internet RFC 952 to the format used by the network
       library  routines.  Three files are created as a result of
       running htable: hosts, networks, and gateways.  The  hosts
       file  may be used by the routines in mapping host names to
       addresses if the nameserver, is  not  used.  The  networks
       file  is  used by the routines in mapping network names to
       numbers. The gateways file may be used by the routing dae-
       mon  in  identifying passive Internet gateways; see for an
       explanation.

       If any of the files localhosts, localnetworks,  or  local-
       gateways  are present in the current directory, the file's
       contents is prepended to the output file. Of  these,  only
       the  gateways  file  is  interpreted. This allows sites to
       maintain local aliases and entries which are not  normally
       present  in  the master database. Only one gateway to each
       network will be placed in the  gateways  file;  a  gateway
       listed  in the localgateways file will override any in the
       input file.

       If the gateways file is to be used, a list of networks  to
       which the host is directly connected is specified with the
       -c flag. The networks, separated by commas, may  be  given
       by name or in Internet-standard dot notation, for example,
       -c arpanet,128.32,local-ether-net.  htable  only  includes
       gateways  which  are directly connected to one of the net-
       works specified, or which  can  be  reached  from  another
       gateway on a connected net.

       If  the -l option is given with a list of networks (in the
       same format as for -c), these networks will be treated  as
       local,  and  information  about hosts on local networks is
       taken only from the localhosts  file.  Entries  for  local
       hosts  from the main database will be omitted. This allows
       the localhosts file to completely override any entries  in
       the input file.

       htable  is best used in conjunction with the program which
       retrieves the NIC database from a host.
