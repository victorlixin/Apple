       The autoconf6 command assigns link-local addresses to  ND-
       capable network interfaces at boot time.  It also initial-
       izes  the  loopback  interface,   automatic   tunnels   if
       required,  and  adds  some  needed routes.  It can also be
       used at any time to set link-local addresses and automatic
       tunnelling on newly configured Ethernet-like interfaces.

       autoconf6   understands  the  following  options:  Do  not
       install or modify the  Simple  Internet  Transition  (SIT)
       interface and IPv4-compatible interoperability.  Configure
       and bring up  all  acceptable  interfaces.   Compatibility
       flag  for  interfaces with bad link-local addresses.  Con-
       figure and bring up the interfaces in the  argument  list.
       Specify  the  main  interface,  This  is an alternative to
       specifying the main_if6 attribute to (Debug) Do not modify
       existing  IPv6 multicast routes.  (Debug) Do not configure
       the loopback interface.  (Debug) Do not install a  default
       IPv6 route.  Installs the SIT interfaces and IPv4-compati-
       ble programs.  Without this flag, the SIT  interfaces  are
       configured  only if an SIT interface is already up.  (Ver-
       bose) Report program activity and failures.

       If neither -a nor -i is specified, only  currently  active
       (up) interfaces are configured.

       autoconf6  only  configures Ethernet- and FDDI-like inter-
       faces, that is, interfaces with  broadcast  and  multicast
       capability, and with a 6-byte link-layer (MAC) address.

       Network collisions can cause autoconf6 to fail.
