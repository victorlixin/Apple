       host is a simple utility for performing DNS  lookups.   It
       is normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice
       versa.  When no  arguments  or  options  are  given,  host
       prints  a  short summary of its command line arguments and
       options.

       name is the domain name that is to be looked up.   It  can
       also be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited
       IPv6 address, in which case host will by default perform a
       reverse  lookup  for  that address.  server is an optional
       argument which is either the name or  IP  address  of  the
       name  server  that host should query instead of the server
       or servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf,

       The -a (all) option is equivalent to setting the -v option
       and asking host to make a query of type ANY.

       When  the  -C option is used, host will attempt to display
       the SOA records for zone name from all the listed authori-
       tative  name  servers  for  that  zone.   The list of name
       servers is defined by the NS records that  are  found  for
       the zone.

       The -c option instructs to make a DNS query of class class
       .  This can be used to lookup  Hesiod  or  Chaosnet  class
       resource records.  The default class is IN: Internet.

       Verbose  output  is  generated  by  host when the -d or -v
       option is used.  The two  options  are  equivalent.   They
       have been provided for backwards compatibility.  In previ-
       ous versions, the -d option switched on  debugging  traces
       and -v enabled verbose output.

       List  mode  is selected by the -l option.  This makes host
       perform a zone transfer for zone name .  The  argument  is
       provided  for  compatibility with older implemementations.
       This option is equivalent to making a query of type  AXFR.

       The  -n  option  specifies  that  reverse  lookups of IPv6
       addresses should  use  the  IP6.INT  domain  and  "nibble"
       labels  as  defined  in  RFC1886.   The  default is to use
       IP6.ARPA and binary labels as defined in RFC2874.

       The -N option sets the number of dots that have to  be  in
       name  for it to be considered absolute.  The default value
       is   that   defined   using   the   ndots   statement   in
       /etc/resolv.conf  , or 1 if no ndots statement is present.
       Names with fewer dots are interpreted  as  relative  names
       and  will  be  searched  for  in the domains listed in the

                                                                1

host(1Mtcp)                                           host(1Mtcp)

       search or domain directive in /etc/resolv.conf .

       The number of UDP retries for a lookup can be changed with
       the  -R option.  number indicates how many times host will
       repeat a query that does not get  answered.   The  default
       number  of  retries  is 1.  If number is negative or zero,
       the number of retries will default to 1.

       Non-recursive queries can be made via the -r option.  Set-
       ting  this  option clears the RD - recursion desired - bit
       in the query which host makes.  This should mean that  the
       name  server  receiving  the  query  will  not  attempt to
       resolve name .  The -r option enables host  to  mimic  the
       behaviour of a name server by making non-recursive queries
       and expecting to receive answers to those queries that are
       usually referrals to other name servers.

       By  default  host  uses  UDP  when making queries.  The -T
       option makes it use a TCP  connection  when  querying  the
       name  server.   TCP  will  be  automatically  selected for
       queries that require it,  such  as  zone  transfer  (AXFR)
       requests.

       The  -t option is used to select the query type.  type can
       be any recognised query type: CNAME, NS,  SOA,  SIG,  KEY,
       AXFR, etc.  When no query type is specified, host automat-
       ically selects an appropriate query type.  By  default  it
       looks  for  A  records,  but  if  the -C option was given,
       queries will be made for SOA records, and  if  name  is  a
       dotted-decimal   IPv4   address  or  colon-delimited  IPv6
       address, host will query for PTR records.

       The time to wait for a reply can be controlled through the
       -W and -w options.  The -W option makes host wait for wait
       seconds.  If wait is less than one, the wait  interval  is
       set  to one second.  When the -w option is used, host will
       effectively wait forever for a reply.  The  time  to  wait
       for  a response will be set to the number of seconds given
       by the hardware's maximum value for an integer quantity.
