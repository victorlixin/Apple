       The  trpt  command  interrogates  the  buffer of TCP trace
       records created when a socket is marked for debugging (see
       SO_DEBUG  in  and  prints  a readable description of these
       records.

       When no options are supplied, trpt prints  all  the  trace
       records  found in the system grouped according to TCP con-
       nection  protocol  control  block  (PCB).   The  following
       options may be used to alter this behavior: In addition to
       the normal output, print the values of the source and des-
       tination  addresses  for each packet recorded.  Follow the
       trace as it occurs, waiting a short  time  for  additional
       records  each  time  the  end of the log is reached.  Just
       give a list of the protocol control  block  addresses  for
       which  there  are  trace records.  Show only trace records
       associated with the  hexadecimal  protocol  control  block
       address,  pcb_addr.  This address can be obtained from the
       PCB field of the output from the netstat -A  command.   In
       addition  to  the normal output, print a detailed descrip-
       tion of the packet sequencing information.  In addition to
       the normal output, print the values for all timers at each
       point in the trace.  The recommended use  of  trpt  is  as
       follows:  Isolate  the problem and enable debugging on the
       socket(s) involved in the connection.  Use the netstat  -A
       command to find the address of the protocol control blocks
       (PCB) associated with the sockets.  Run trpt with  the  -p
       option  for each protocol control block address.  Once the
       trace is located, use the -f option to  follow  the  trace
       log.   If  there  are  many  sockets  using  the debugging
       option, the -j option may be useful in checking to see  if
       any  trace records are present for the socket in question.
       Use the system and core arguments if  debugging  is  being
       performed on a system or core file other than the default.
