       The  time  server  daemon,  timed,  can  be invoked during
       startup by including an appropriate line in the file.

       timed synchronizes the host's time with the time of  other
       machines  in  a  local  area network running timed.  These
       time servers will slow down the clocks  of  some  machines
       and  speed  up  the  clocks of others to bring them to the
       average network time.  The average network  time  is  com-
       puted  from  measurements  of  clock differences using the
       ICMP timestamp request message.

       The service provided by timed is based  on a  master-slave
       scheme.  When  timed  is started on a machine, it asks the
       master for the network time and sets the host's  clock  to
       that  time.   After  that, it accepts synchronization mes-
       sages periodically sent by the master and calls to perform
       the needed corrections on the host's clock.

       It  also  communicates  with to set the date globally, and
       with a timed control program.  If the machine running  the
       master  crashes,  then  the slaves will elect a new master
       from among slaves running with the -M flag.  A timed  run-
       ning without the -M flag will remain a slave.

       The  -t  flag  enables  timed  to  trace  the  messages it
       receives in the file /var/adm/timed.log.  Tracing  can  be
       turned on or off by the program

       Normally,  timed  checks  for a master time server on each
       network to which it is connected, except  as  modified  by
       the options described below.  It will request synchroniza-
       tion service from the first  master  server  located.   If
       permitted  by the -M flag, it will provide synchronization
       service on any attached networks on which no current  mas-
       ter  server  was  detected.   Such a server propagates the
       time computed by the top-level master.  The -n flag,  fol-
       lowed by the name of a network which the host is connected
       to (see  overrides  the  default  choice  of  the  network
       addresses  made  by  the  program.   Each time the -n flag
       appears, that network name is added to  a  list  of  valid
       networks.  All other networks are ignored.

       The  -i  flag,  followed by the name of a network to which
       the host is connected (see overrides the default choice of
       the  network addresses made by the program.  Each time the
       -i flag appears, that network name is added to a  list  of
       networks  to  ignore.   All other networks are used by the
       time daemon.

       NOTE: The -n and -i flags  will  be  meaningless  if  used

                                                                1

       Messages  in  the system log about machines that failed to
       respond usually indicate machines  that  crashed  or  were
       turned  off.   Complaints  about  machines  that failed to
       respond to initial time settings are often associated with
       ``multi-homed''  machines  that looked for time masters on
       more than one network and eventually  chose  to  become  a
       slave on the other network.

       If two or more time daemons such as timed and xntpd try to
       adjust the same clock, temporal chaos may result.
