       The  rexecd  command  is  the server for the routine.  The
       server provides remote execution facilities with authenti-
       cation based on user names and encrypted passwords.

       All  diagnostic  messages  are  returned on the connection
       associated with the stderr, after which any  network  con-
       nections  are  closed.  An error is indicated by a leading
       byte with a value of 1; the value 0 is returned in step  7
       below upon successful completion of all the steps prior to
       the command execution.  The name is longer than 16 charac-
       ters.   The  password  is  longer than 16 characters.  The
       command line passed exceeds the size of the argument  list
       (as  configured  into the system).  No password file entry
       for the user name existed.  The wrong  password  was  sup-
       plied.  The chdir command to the home directory failed.  A
       fork by the server failed.  The user's login  shell  could
       not be started.

       rexecd is invoked automatically as needed by and then exe-
       cutes the following protocol: The server reads  characters
       from  the  socket  up  to a null (\0) byte.  The resultant
       string is interpreted as an ASCII number, base 10.  If the
       number  received  in step 1 is non-zero, it is interpreted
       as the port number of a secondary stream to  be  used  for
       the  stderr.   A  second connection is then created to the
       specified port on the client's machine.  A null terminated
       user  name  of  at  most 16 characters is retrieved on the
       initial socket.  A null terminated, encrypted, password of
       at  most 16 characters is retrieved on the initial socket.
       A null terminated command to  be  passed  to  a  shell  is
       retrieved on the initial socket. The length of the command
       is limited by the upper bound on the size of the  system's
       argument  list.  rexecd then validates the user as is done
       at login time and, if the authentication  was  successful,
       changes  to the user's home directory, and establishes the
       user and group protections of the user.  If any  of  these
       steps  fail  the  connection  is aborted with a diagnostic
       message returned.  A null byte is returned on the  connec-
       tion  associated  with  the stderr and the command line is
       passed to the normal login shell of the user.   The  shell
       inherits the network connections established by rexecd.

       Indicating  Login  incorrect as opposed to Password incor-
       rect is a security breach which allows people to  probe  a
       system for users with null passwords.
