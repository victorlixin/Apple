       The arp program displays and modifies the IPv4-to-hardware
       address translation table, which is normally maintained by
       the address resolution protocol (see

       When  hostname is the only argument, arp displays the cur-
       rent ARP entry for hostname. The host may be specified  by
       name or by number, using Internet dot notation (see and

       Options  are  interpreted  as  follows: Display all of the
       current ARP entries by reading the table from the  kernel.
       Delete  an  entry  for  the  host  whose name is hostname.
       (This can only be performed by root.)  Read the file file-
       name  and  set multiple entries in the ARP tables. Entries
       in the file should be of the form hostname hardware_addr [
       temp ] [ pub ] with argument meanings as defined under the
       -s option.  Send an ARP request, avoiding  the  cache,  on
       the   specified  interface  interface_name  (for  example,
       net0). In the broadcast request, the sender's  IP  address
       is  that  of  the interface, the sender's hardware address
       (MAC address) is that of the interface, and the target  IP
       address is that specified by target_ipaddr.

       On  interfaces  with  aliased IP addresses (see a separate
       ARP request is broadcast for each alias address  with  the
       sender's IP address set to the alias address.

       As  generally  used,  the sender expects the host with the
       target IP address to respond with an ARP reply  containing
       its hardware address.

       If  the  sender  and  target IP addresses are identical, a
       gratuitous ARP request is broadcast.   This  allows  other
       hosts on the network to update their cache entries for the
       sender's IP address with the hardware address contained in
       the  request.  No  reply is expected.  If an interface has
       been configured with several alias IP addresses,  a  sepa-
       rate  gratuitous  ARP  request  must be issued for each IP
       address which needs to notify its  corresponding  hardware

                                                                1

       address  to the network.  Create an ARP entry for the host
       whose name is hostname with  the  hardware  address  hard-
       ware_addr.   The  hardware  address is given as six colon-
       separated, two-digit hexadecimal numbers.  The entry  will
       be  permanent unless the argument temp is specified on the
       command line.  If pub is  specified,  the  entry  will  be
       ``published'':  that  is,  this  system will act as an ARP
       server, responding to requests for  hostname  even  though
       the  host  address  is  not  an address of the local host.
       Displays the ARP statistics  that  the  kernel  maintains;
       these  may  be  useful for debugging network problems.  If
       the -n flag is specified, arp will  not  display  symbolic
       names,   but   instead   will   display  numeric  Internet
       addresses.
