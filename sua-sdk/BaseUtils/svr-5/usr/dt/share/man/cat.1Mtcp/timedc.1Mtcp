       timedc  controls  the  operation of the timed program.  It
       may be used to: measure the differences between  machines'
       clocks  find  the location where the master time server is
       running enable or disable tracing of messages received  by
       timed  perform various debugging actions Without any argu-
       ments, timedc will prompt for commands from  the  standard
       input.   If  arguments are supplied, timedc interprets the
       first argument as a command and the remaining arguments as
       parameters  to  the  command.   The  standard input may be
       redirected causing timedc to read commands  from  a  file.
       Commands  may  be  abbreviated;  recognized  commands are:
       Print a short description of each command specified in the
       argument  list,  or,  if no arguments are given, a list of
       the recognized commands.  Compute the differences  between
       the  clock  of  the  host  machine  and  the clocks of the
       machines given as arguments.  This  command  is  used  for
       testing  only.   It causes host's election timer to expire
       immediately.  Show the master time server for  the  speci-
       fied  hosts,  or  the local host if host is not specified.
