       The spray command sends a one-way  stream  of  packets  to
       host  using  RPC,  and  reports how many were received, as
       well as the transfer rate.

       The host argument can be either  a  name  or  an  Internet
       address.

       spray  takes the following options: Specify how many pack-
       ets to send.  The default value of count is the number  of
       packets  required  to  make  the  total stream size 100000
       bytes.  Specify how many  microseconds  to  pause  between
       sending each packet.  The default is 0.  The length param-
       eter is the numbers of bytes in the Ethernet  packet  that
       holds  the  RPC  call  message.  Since the data is encoded
       using XDR, and XDR only deals with 32-bit quantities,  not
       all  values of length are possible, and spray rounds up to
       the nearest possible value.  When length is  greater  than
       1514,  then  the RPC call can no longer be encapsulated in
       one Ethernet packet, so the length field no longer  has  a
       simple   correspondence  to  Ethernet  packet  size.   The
       default value of length is 86 bytes (the size of  the  RPC
       and  UDP headers).  Specify class of transports.  Defaults
       to netpath.  See for a description of supported classes.
