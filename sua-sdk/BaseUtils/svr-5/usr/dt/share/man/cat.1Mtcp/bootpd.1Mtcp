       bootpd  implements  an Internet Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
       server as defined in RFC 951, RFC 1542, and RFC 2132.

       One host on each network segment is normally configured to
       run  bootpd  from inetd by including the following line in
       the file  /etc/inetd.conf:  bootps  dgram  udp  wait  root
       /usr/sbin/in.bootpd in.bootpd bootptab This mode of opera-
       tion is referred to as inetd mode and causes bootpd to  be
       started  only  when a boot request arrives. If it does not
       receive another packet within fifteen minutes of the  last
       one   it   received,  it  will  exit  to  conserve  system
       resources.  The  -t  option  controls  this  timeout  (see
       ``Options'').

       It  is  also  possible  to  run  bootpd in standalone mode
       (without inetd) by simply invoking it from  a  shell  like
       any other regular command. Standalone mode is particularly
       useful when bootpd is  used  with  a  large  configuration
       database, where the start up delay might otherwise prevent
       timely response to client requests.

       bootpd automatically detects whether it was  invoked  from
       inetd or from a shell and automatically selects the appro-
       priate mode. The -s or -i option  may  be  used  to  force
       standalone  or inetd mode, respectively (see ``Options'').

   OOppttiioonnss
       Sets the current directory used by bootpd  while  checking
       the  existence  and size of client boot files. This option
       has no effect because this implementation of  bootpd  does
       not do this checking. This option is equivalent with -p on
       some older versions of bootpd.  Sets the debug_level vari-
       able that controls the amount of debugging messages gener-
       ated. For example, -D 1 will set the debugging level to 1.
       Recognized values are 0, 1, 2, and 3 or greater. Zero gen-
       erates no messages and 1 to 3 generate increasing  amounts
       of  messages.  Specifying  an  integer over 3 has the same
       result as specifying 3. For compatibility with older  ver-
       sions of bootpd, using the option -d (without an argument)
       will simply increment the debug level by one.  Force inetd
       mode. This option is obsolete, but remains for compatibil-
       ity with older versions of bootpd.  Specifies an alternate
       port  on  which bootpd listens for BOOTP packets when run-
       ning in slave mode. Use this option if dhcpd is running on
       the  same  host.   Force  standalone  mode. This option is
       obsolete, but remains for compatibility  with  older  ver-
       sions  of bootpd.  Forces slave mode, which is required if
       dhcpd is running on the same host as bootpd.  This  option

                                                                1

bootpd(1Mtcp)                                       bootpd(1Mtcp)

       forces  bootpd to listen for packets on the port specified
       with the -P option.  Specifies the timeout value (in  min-
       utes)  that  a bootpd process will wait for a BOOTP packet
       before exiting. If no packets  are  received  for  timeout
       minutes,  then  the  program will exit. A timeout value of
       zero means ``run  forever''.   In  standalone  mode,  this
       option  is forced to zero.  bootptab specifies the name of
       an alternate configuration file from  which  bootpd  loads
       its  database  of  known  clients and client options.  The
       default configuration file is /etc/inet/bootptab.

       dumpfile specifies the name of the file into which  bootpd
       will  dump  its internal database if it receives a SIGUSR1
       signal.

       bootpd listens for any packets sent to the bootps port and
       forwards any BOOTREPLY packets.

       When  bootpd  is  started,  it  reads a configuration file
       (normally /etc/inet/bootptab) that initializes the  inter-
       nal  database  of  known clients and client options.  This
       internal database is reloaded from the configuration  file
       when  bootpd  receives a hangup signal (SIGHUP) or when it
       discovers that the configuration file has changed.

       When bootpd receives a BOOTREQUEST packet, it  checks  the
       modification  time  of  the configuration file and reloads
       the database if necessary. Then it looks  for  a  database
       entry matching the client request. If the client is known,
       bootpd composes a  BOOTREPLY  packet  using  the  database
       entry  found above and sends the reply to the client (pos-
       sibly using a gateway). If  the  client  is  unknown,  the
       request  is discarded (with a notice if the debug level is
       greater than 0).

       The receipt of a SIGUSR1 signal causes bootpd to dump  its
       internal  database to the file /usr/tmp/bootpd.dump or the
       dumpfile specified as a command line argument.

       During initialization, bootpd determines the UDP port num-
       bers  to be used by calling getservbyname (see (which nor-
       mally uses /etc/services).  Two service  names  (and  port
       numbers)  are  used:  BOOTP  server  listening  port BOOTP
       client destination port If  the  port  numbers  cannot  be
       determined using getservbyname, then the values default to
       bootps=67 and bootpc=68.

       When running dhcpd and bootpd on  the  same  host,  bootpd
       must  be  run  in  "slave mode" by using the -S option. In
       this mode, bootpd listens on an alternate port  which  you
       specify  with the -P option. For information about running
       bootpd and dhcpd on the same host, see

                                                                2
