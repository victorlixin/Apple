       ripquery is used to request all  routes  known  by  a  RIP
       gateway  by  sending  a  RIP REQUEST or POLL command.  The
       routing information in any  routing  packets  returned  is
       displayed   numerically  and  symbolically.   ripquery  is
       intended to be used as a tool for debugging gateways,  not
       for  network  management.   SNMP is the preferred protocol
       for network management.

       ripquery by default uses the RIP POLL command, which is an
       undocumented  extension to the RIP specification supported
       by routed on SunOS3.x and  later  and  by  gated  1.4  and
       later.  The  RIP  POLL  command  is preferred over the RIP
       REQUEST command because it is not subject to Split Horizon
       and/or  Poisoned Reverse.  See the RIP RFC for more infor-
       mation.

       Send the query as a version 1 packet.  Send the query as a
       version  2  packet  (default).   Specifies  that the query
       should be for the  specified  destination  (with  optional
       mask) instead of the complete routing table.  Specifying a
       mask implies a version 2 query.  As many  as  23  requests
       about  specific  destinations may be included in a packet.
       Specifies the authentication password to use for  queries.
       If  specified,  an  authentication  type of SIMPLE will be
       used, otherwise the default is an authentication  type  of
       NONE.   Authentication  fields in incoming packets will be
       displayed, but not validated.  Turn  on  debugging.   Nor-
       mally network and host numbers are displayed both symboli-
       cally and numerically. When this option is specified, net-
       work  and  host  numbers  are  only displayed numerically.
       Uses the RIP POLL command to request information from  the
       routing  table.   This  is  the default, but is an undocu-
       mented extension supported only by some versions of routed
       and  later  versions of gated.  If there is no response to
       the RIP POLL command, the RIP REQUEST  command  is  tried.
       gated  responds  to  a  POLL  command  with all the routes
       learned via RIP.  Used the RIP REQUEST command to  request
       information  from  the gateway's routing table. Unlike the
       RIP POLL command, all  gateways  should  support  the  RIP
       REQUEST.  If  there is no response to the RIP REQUEST com-
       mand, the RIP POLL command is tried.  Version  information
       about  ripquery is displayed before querying the gateways.
       Specifies the time in seconds  to  wait  for  the  initial
       response  from a gateway.  The default value is 5 seconds.

       The following command may be issued to send  a  version  1
       RIP POLL packet to request all the routes from the gateway
       lancelot.  ripquery -1 -p lancelot In order to request the
       routing  table from the gateway grinch using a RIP REQUEST
       packet (as opposed to using a RIP POLL packet),  the  fol-
       lowing command may be issued.  ripquery -r grinch
