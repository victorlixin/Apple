       Before  you  can  use DNS to resolve  names, you must make
       sure that the names you want to add are encoded in a  form
       acceptable to DNS. The nbtodns command enables you to gen-
       erate a DNS encoded name from a name.  The  -d  option  of
       nbtodns  and the dnstonb command both enable you to decode
       a DNS encoded name back into a valid  name.

       Since  names can contain spaces and non-printable  charac-
       ters it is usually best to enclose the name in quotes when
       you specify NetBIOS_name. Non-printable characters  should
       be represented in hexadecimal format by specify two digits
       following a ``\0x''  prefix.   The  DNS  Manager  performs
       automatic  encoding  and  decoding of  names. It is recom-
       mended, that whenever possible, you use  the  DNS  Manager
       instead of nbtodns for converting  names.

       To  convert  a  name ``1demonstration\0x00\0x1c'', use the
       following command:  nbtodns  1demonstration\0x00\0x1c  The
       resulting  DNS  name would be: DBGEGFGNGPGOHDHEHCGBHEGJGP-
       GOAABM To convert the same DNS name back to a   name,  use
       either of the following commands: nbtodns -d DBGEGFGNGPGO-
       HDHEHCGBHEGJGPGOAABM  or   dnstonb   DBGEGFGNGPGOHDHEHCGB-
       HEGJGPGOAABM  The  resulting   name  would be the same for
       both commands: 1demonstration\0x00\0x1c
