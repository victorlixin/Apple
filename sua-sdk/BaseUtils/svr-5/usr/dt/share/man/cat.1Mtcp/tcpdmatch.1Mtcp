       tcpdmatch predicts how the tcp wrapper would handle a spe-
       cific request for service.

       The  program  examines  the  tcpd  access  control  tables
       (default /etc/inet/hosts.allow  and  /etc/inet/hosts.deny)
       and  prints  its  conclusion.   For  maximum  accuracy, it
       extracts additional information from  your  inetd  network
       configuration file.

       When tcpdmatch finds a match in the access control tables,
       it identifies the matched rule. In addition,  it  displays
       the optional shell commands or options in a pretty-printed
       format. This makes it easier for you to spot any  discrep-
       ancies  between  what you want and what the program under-
       stands.

       The following two arguments are always required: A  daemon
       process  name.   Typically, the last component of a daemon
       executable pathname.

       The optionally specified server may be a host name or net-
       work  address,  or one of the unknown or paranoid wildcard
       patterns.  The default server name is `unknown'.   A  host
       name or network address, or one of the unknown or paranoid
       wildcard patterns.

       The optionally specified user is a client user identifier,
       typically,  a login name or a numeric userid.  The default
       user name is unknown.  When a client host name  is  speci-
       fied, tcpdmatch gives a prediction for each address listed
       for that client.

       When a client address  is  specified,  tcpdmatch  predicts
       what tcpd would do when client name lookup fails.

   OOppttiioonnss
       tcpdmatch   understands  the  following  options:  Examine
       hosts.allow and hosts.deny files in the current  directory
       instead  of  the  default  ones.  Specify this option when
       tcpdmatch is unable to find your inetd network  configura-
       tion  file,  or when you suspect that the program uses the
       wrong one.
