       The ping command uses  the  ICMP  protocol's  ECHO_REQUEST
       datagram  to  elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from the speci-
       fied host or network  gateway.   If  host  responds,  ping
       prints ``host is alive'' on the standard output and exits.
       Otherwise, after timeout seconds, it  writes  ``no  answer
       from  host''.  The default value of timeout is 20 seconds.

       When the -s flag is specified, ping sends one datagram per
       second,   and   prints   one  line  of  output  for  every
       ECHO_RESPONSE that it receives.  In this second form, ping
       computes  round  trip times and packet loss statistics; it
       displays a summary of this information upon termination or
       timeout.   If  an  optional  npackets is given, ping sends
       only that number of requests.  If npackets is  not  speci-
       fied, the command will execute indefinitely.  Use the key-
       board interrupt (Delete) key to interrupt  the  continuous
       output.

       The  default  datagram packet size is 64 bytes, or you can
       specify a size with the data_size  command-line  argument.
       Note  that, since ping routinely prepends an 8-byte header
       to each datagram it sends, the packet size  that  displays
       when  the  -s  option  is used with the data_size argument
       will always be 8 bytes larger than the value you  specify.

       When using ping for fault isolation, you should first ping
       the local host to verify that the local network  interface
       is running.

       The  ping command takes the following options: Debug mode.
       The provider is passed the SO_DEBUG option.   Flood  ping.
       Outputs  packets  as fast as they come back or one hundred
       times  per  second,  whichever   is   more.    For   every
       ECHO_REQUEST sent, a dot ``.'' is printed, while for every
       ECHO_REPLY received, a backspace is  printed.   This  pro-
       vides  a  rapid  display  of  how  many  packets are being
       dropped.  Only a privileged  user  may  use  this  option.
       This can be very hard on a network and should be used with
       caution.  Wait wait seconds between sending  each  packet.
       The  default  is  to  wait for one second between packets.
       This option is incompatible with  the  -f  option.   Loose
       source  route.   Use  this option in the IP header to send
       the packet to the given  host  and  back  again.   Usually
       specified with the -R option.  The -l option is only valid
       when the host is localhost or `uname -n`.  Numeric  output

                                                                1

       only.   No  attempt will be made to look up symbolic names
       for host addresses.  The specified pattern is used to fill
       packets  being  sent.   pattern is specified as a hex byte
       string and may be up to 16 bytes  long.   The  pattern  is
       repeated  to  fill  the  data  portion of the packet.  For
       example, -p ff causes packets to be filled with all  ones.
       This  option is useful for diagnosing data-dependent prob-
       lems in a network.  Quiet output.  Causes  nothing  to  be
       displayed  except  the  summary  lines at startup time and
       when finished.  Bypass the normal routing tables and  send
       directly to a host on an attached network.  If the host is
       not on a directly-attached network, an error is  returned.
       This  option  can  be used to ping a local host through an
       interface that has been dropped by the router daemon  (see
       Record route.  Sets the IP record route option, which will
       store the route of the packet inside the IP  header.   The
       contents  of  the record route will only be printed if the
       -v  option is given, and only be set on return packets  if
       the  target  host preserves the record route option across
       echos, or the -l option is given.  Send one  datagram  per
       second,   and   print   one   line  of  output  for  every
       ECHO_RESPONSE received (if there is no response, no output
       is  produced).   Verbose  output.   List any ICMP packets,
       other than ECHO_RESPONSE, that are received.
