       tftpd  is  a  server  that supports the DARPA Trivial File
       Transfer Protocol (TFTP).

       Secure.  When specified, the directory  change  must  suc-
       ceed;  and  the  daemon also changes its root directory to
       homedir.

       The use of tftp does not require an account or password on
       the  remote  system.   Due  to  the lack of authentication
       information, tftp will allow only publicly readable  files
       to be accessed.  Files may be written only if they already
       exist and are publicly writable.  Note that  this  extends
       the  concept  of  ``public''  to  include all users on all
       hosts that can be reached through the  network;  this  may
       not  be  appropriate  on all systems, and its implications
       should be considered before enabling this  service.   Note
       that  tftpd  runs  with  the  user  ID and group ID set to
       [GU]ID_NOBODY, under the assumption that  no  files  exist
       with  that  owner  or group.  However, nothing checks this
       assumption or enforces this restriction.

       tftpd is normally started by  and  operates  at  the  port
       indicated  in the tftp Internet service description in the
       /etc/inetd.conf file.

       By default, the entry for tftpd in /etc/inetd.conf is com-
       mented  out.  To make tftpd operational, the comment char-
       acter(s) must be deleted from the tftpd  entry.   See  for
       details.

       Before  responding  to  a  request, the server attempts to
       change its current directory to homedir; the default value
       is /tftpboot.
