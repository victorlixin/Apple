       The bootp command gives client hosts the ability to obtain
       network  configuration information from a central Internet
       Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) server (see

       bootp can be run at system installation time, or in  cases
       where the characteristics of the network change (for exam-
       ple, when a new domain  name  server  is  added)  and  the
       client's  configuration  files  must be updated to reflect
       the changes to the network.

       bootp can be run by a privileged user only.

       When invoked, bootp broadcasts a BOOTP request  containing
       the  hardware  address of the Ethernet interface specified
       by its device name (such as /dev/net0).  By  default,  the
       broadcast  is  made  over the first network interface that
       the kernel finds that  supports  broadcasting  unless  the
       name  of  a different interface, interface_name, is speci-
       fied using the -a option.

       The bootpd daemon on the  BOOTP  server  responds  to  the
       request.   bootp  interprets the response and prints shell
       variables on the standard output which correspond  to  the
       attribute values contained in the response.  If a randomly
       varied time-out period expires without a  response,  bootp
       resends  the  request  and  increases the time-out period.
       The request is retried until number_of_tries  (default  5)
       is reached.

       To  avoid  the  possibility of exhausting the space in the
       64-byte vend area of the request/response packet, the host
       name  and  domain name attributes are obtained via reverse
       DNS lookup.  The local file and the file are not consulted
       for  this operation; any DNS servers specified in the vend
       area are consulted instead.

       The BOOTP attributes that  are  currently  used,  together
       with  the  shell variables output by bootp, are summarized
       in the following tables:

       Note that, in cases where  reverse  DNS  lookup  is  used,
       bootp outputs the INET_HOSTNAME and INET_DOMAIN_NAME vari-
       ables.

       The attribute names shown in these tables are  implemented
       as  parameter  declarations in the BOOTP server configura-
       tion file /etc/inet/bootptab (see

   OOppttiioonnss
       bootp takes the following options: Specify the name of the
       Ethernet  interface,  such as net1, which is to be used to
       communicate with the BOOTP server.

       The Ethernet interface specified by interface_name is tem-
       porarily  configured  with  an  IP  address of zero.  This
       allows bootp to receive  a  response  if  the  current  IP
       address of the interface does not match that configured on
       the BOOTP server for the hardware address of  device.   To
       avoid  networking  errors, do not invoke bootp with the -a
       option from a multiuser system when the  interface  speci-
       fied by interface_name is in use.  Specifies the number of
       unanswered BOOTP requests to send before giving  up.   The
       default  value  is  5.   Do not use DNS to obtain the host
       name and the domain name.

       On success, bootp returns zero.

       On a timeout,  it  returns  254  and  prints  the  message
       INET_BOOTP_TIMEDOUT=yes to the standard error output.

       The  ht  (hardware address type) and ha (hardware address)
       attributes are used by the  BOOTP  server  to  locate  the
       proper  entry  in  its configuration file.  Note that this
       client host forces the BOOTP server to choose  an  address
       by always setting the ciaddr field in the request to zero.
       The value of the bootp argument hostname is placed in  the
       request vend area ``Host Name'' field so that a server may
       choose to respond based on this hostname if  a  lookup  by
       hardware   address   fails.    The   Class  Identifier  of
       ``UnixWare'' is also provided in the request  to  identify
       the client as a UnixWare system.
