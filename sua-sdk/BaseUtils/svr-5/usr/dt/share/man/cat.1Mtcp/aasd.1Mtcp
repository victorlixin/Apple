       The  Address  Allocation  Server  daemon,  aasd, allocates
       addresses to network services, such as DHCP, which need to
       assign  temporary  addresses.  It  manages the information
       about allocated addresses, such as the service  requesting
       the address and for how long the address is reserved.

       If  the  configuration  file (/etc/inet/aasd.conf) exists,
       aasd starts automatically.  The configuration file defines
       the  address  pools  available  for  allocation along with
       server parameters.

       aasd maintains an address database of  current  allocation
       information  in memory and records changes to the database
       in a transaction log stored  on  disk.  At  startup,  aasd
       rebuilds  the database from the transaction log. aasd will
       compress the transaction log when the log reaches  a  con-
       figurable size.

       At  a  checkpoint  interval, aasd constructs a transaction
       log which represents the  current  allocation  information
       and  stores  this  log  as  a  checkpoint file.  aasd will
       rebuild the address database with the most  recent  check-
       point  file if the current transaction log is lost or cor-
       rupted. The checkpoint interval along with the number  and
       location  of the checkpoint files are configurable parame-
       ters.

       Sets the debug_level variable that controls the amount  of
       debugging  messages  generated. For example, -D 1 will set
       the debugging level to 1.  Recognized values are 0, 1,  2,
       and  3  or  greater. Zero generates no messages and 1 to 3
       generate increasing amounts  of  messages.  Specifying  an
       integer  greater  than 3 has the same result as specifying
       3. If aasd is running in standalone mode and you specify 3
       or  greater,  messages  will be directed to standard error
       (not to syslog) and aasd does not go into the  background.
       The  Address  Allocation Server Configuration Manager does
       not  support  an  alternate  configuration   database   to
       aasd.conf  nor does it support an alternative location for
       this file.
