       The ndc command allows a system administrator  to  control
       the  operation  of  a name server. If no command is speci-
       fied, ndc will prompt for commands until it reads EOF.

       Also see introduced with BIND 9.

       ndc understands the following options: Specifies the chan-
       nel   to  be  used  for  control.   The  default  channel,
       /etc/inet/ndc, is a   domain  socket  which  is  also  the
       server's  default control channel.  If the desired control
       channel is a  socket, then the format of the channel argu-
       ment is ipaddr/port.  For example, ``127.0.0.1/54'' speci-
       fies TCP port 54 on the local host.   Turns  on  debugging
       output.  Binds the client side of the control channel to a
       specific address.  Servers can  be  configured  to  reject
       connections  which  do  not  come from specific addresses.
       The format of the localsock argument is the  same  as  the
       channel  argument to the -c option.  For backward compati-
       bility with older name servers, ndc  can  control  a  name
       server  by sending  signals to a process ID specified in a
       pidfile.  This  capability  is  optional  in  modern  name
       servers and will disappear altogether at some future time.
       Note that the signal interface only provides a  restricted
       command  set.  The default pidfile is /etc/inet/named.pid.
       Suppresses prompts and result text.   Suppresses  nonfatal
       error announcements.  Increments the level of protocol and
       system tracing.  The following  commands  are  built  into
       ndc:  Toggle  debugging  output.   Force named to dump its
       database and cache to /var/tmp/named_dump.db.  (Equivalent
       to sending SIGINT to the named process.)  Leave ndc.  List
       builtin commands.  Provide  full  information  on  builtin
       commands.   Turn  off  tracing.   (Equivalent  to  sending
       SIGUSR2 to the named process.)  Cause named to toggle  the
       query  logging  feature.   If  query  logging  is on, this
       causes a of each incoming query.  Note that query  logging
       consumes  a lot of log file space.  (Equivalent to sending
       SIGWINCH to the named process.)  Toggle the suppression of
       prompts and result text.  Make named check the serial num-
       bers of all primary and secondary zones, and reload  those
       that have changed. If only certain zones are to be checked
       for reloading, these can  be  specified  as  arguments  to
       reload.   (Equivalent  to sending SIGHUP to the named pro-
       cess.)  Kill and restart named.  Toggle reporting of  non-
       fatal errors.  Start named provided that it is not already
       running.  (pidfile mode only)  Force  named  to  dump  its
       statistics  to /var/tmp/named.stats.  (Equivalent to send-
       ing SIGABRT to the named process.)   Stop  named  provided
       that  it  is running.  Increment trace level.  (Equivalent
       to sending SIGUSR1 to the named process.)  Toggle protocol

                                                                1

       ndc  may  be used to control the operation of name servers
       running on remote machines provided that they are  running
       at  least  version  8.2.1  of BIND and that they have been
       configured to allow remote control as described in

       If running in pidfile mode, any arguments to the start and
       restart  commands are passed to the new named via its com-
       mand line.  If running in channel mode, there is no  start
       command  and the restart command instructs the name server
       to re-execute itself.
