       dnssec-signkey is used to sign a key set for a child zone.
       Typically  this  would be provided by a keyset file gener-
       ated by This provides a mechanism for a DNSSEC-aware  zone
       to  sign  the  keys  of any DNSSEC-aware child zones.  The
       child zone's key set gets signed with the  zone  keys  for
       its parent zone.  keyset will be the pathname of the child
       zone's keyset file.  Each keyfile argument will be  a  key
       identification  string as reported by for the parent zone.
       This allows the child's keys to be signed by more than one
       parent zone key.

       The  -h  option makes dnssec-signkey print a short summary
       of its command line options and arguments.

       By default, the  validity  period  of  the  generated  SIG
       records is copied from that of the signatures in the input
       key set.  This  may  be  overriden  with  the  -s  and  -e
       options,  both of which must be present if either is.  The
       start of the validity period  is  specified  with  the  -s
       option.   start-time can either be an absolute or relative
       date.  An absolute start time is indicated by a number  in
       YYYYMMDDHHMMSS  notation:  20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00
       UTC on May 30th, 2000.  A relative start time is  supplied
       when start-time is given as +N: N seconds from the current
       time.  If no -s option is supplied, the current  date  and
       time is used for the start time of the SIG records.

       The  expiry  date for the SIG records can be set by the -e
       option.  Note that in this context, the expiry date speci-
       fies  when  the  SIG records are no longer valid, not when
       they are deleted from caches on  name  servers.   end-date
       also represents an absolute or relative date.  YYYYMMDDHH-
       MMSS notation is used as before to  indicate  an  absolute
       date and time.  When end-date is +N, it indicates that the
       SIG records will expire in N  seconds  after  their  start
       date.   If  end-date  is written as now+N, the SIG records
       will expire in N seconds after the current time.

       The -c option specifies that the KEY records in the  input
       and  output  key  sets  should  have  the  specified class
       instead of IN.

       dnssec-signkey may need random numbers in the  process  of
       generating  keys.  If the system does not have a /dev/ran-
       dom device that can be used for generating random numbers,
       dnssec-signkey  will prompt for keyboard input and use the
       time intervals between keystrokes to  provide  randomness.
       The  -r  option  overrides  this behaviour, making dnssec-
       signkey use randomdev as a source of random data.

                                                                1

dnssec-signkey(1Mtcp)                       dnssec-signkey(1Mtcp)

       The -p option instructs dnssec-signkey to use  pseudo-ran-
       dom  data when signing the keys.  This is faster, but less
       secure, than using  genuinely  random  data  for  signing.
       This  option  may be useful when there are many child zone
       keysets to sign or if the entropy source is  limited.   It
       could  also  be  used  for short-lived keys and signatures
       that don't require as much protection against  cryptanaly-
       sis, such as when the key will be discarded long before it
       could be compromised.

       The -v option can be used to make dnssec-signkey more ver-
       bose.   As  the  debugging/tracing  level level increases,
       dnssec-signkey  generates  increasingly  detailed  reports
       about what it is doing.  The default level is zero.

       When dnssec-signkey completes successfully, it generates a
       file called signedkey-nnnn.  containing  the  signed  keys
       for  child zone nnnn .  The keys from the keyset file will
       have been signed by the parent zone's key  or  keys  which
       were  supplied  as keyfile arguments.  This file should be
       sent to the DNS administrator of  the  child  zone.   They
       arrange  for its contents to be incorporated into the zone
       file when it next gets signed with A copy of the generated
       signedkey  file  should  be  kept by the parent zone's DNS
       administrator, since it will be needed  when  signing  the
       parent zone.

       The  DNS  administrator  for a DNSSEC-aware zone would use
       the following command to make dnssec-signkey sign the key-
       set  file  for example.com created in the example shown in
       the man  page  for  #  dnssec-signkey  keyset-example.com.
       Kcom.+003+51944

       where  Kcom.+003+51944  was a key file identifier that was
       produced when generated a key for the zone.

       dnssec-signkey will produce a file called  signedkey-exam-
       ple.com.  which has the keys for example.com signed by the
       com zone's zone key.
