       dig  (domain  information  groper)  is a flexible tool for
       interrogating DNS name servers.  It performs  DNS  lookups
       and  displays  the answers that are returned from the name
       server(s) that were queried.  Most DNS administrators  use
       dig  to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibil-
       ity, ease of use and  clarity  of  output.   Other  lookup
       tools tend to have less functionality than dig .

       Although dig is normally used with command-line arguments,
       it also has a batch mode of operation for  reading  lookup
       requests from a file.  A brief summary of its command-line
       arguments and options is printed when  the  -h  option  is
       given.   Unlike earlier versions, the BIND9 implementation
       of dig allows multiple lookups to be issued from the  com-
       mand line.

       Unless  it  is  told  to query a specific name server, dig
       will try each of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf  .

       When  no command line arguments or options are given, will
       perform an NS query for "." (the root).

       A typical invocation of dig looks like: dig  @server  name
       type

       where:  is  the  name  or IP address of the name server to
       query.  An IPv4 address can be provided in  dotted-decimal
       notation.   When  the  supplied server argument is a host-
       name, dig resolves that name  before  querying  that  name
       server.   If  no server argument is provided, dig consults
       /etc/resolv.conf  and  queries  the  name  servers  listed
       there.   The  reply  from the name server that responds is
       displayed.  is the name of the resource record that is  to
       be  looked up.  indicates what type of query is required -
       ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc.  type can be any valid  query  type.
       If no type argument is supplied, dig will perform a lookup
       for an A record.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The -b option sets the source IP address of the  query  to
       address  .   This  must  be  a valid address on one of the
       host's network interfaces.

                                                                1

dig(1Mtcp)                                             dig(1Mtcp)

       The default query class (IN for internet) is overridden by
       the  -c  option.  class is any valid class, such as HS for
       Hesiod records or CH for CHAOSNET records.

       The -f option makes dig operate in batch mode by reading a
       list  of lookup requests to process from the file filename
       .  The file contains a number of queries,  one  per  line.
       Each entry in the file should be organised in the same way
       they would be presented as queries to dig using  the  com-
       mand-line interface.

       If  a  non-standard  port  number is to be queried, the -p
       option is used.  port# is the port number  that  dig  will
       send  its  queries instead of the standard DNS port number
       53.  This option would be used to test a name server  that
       has  been  configured to listen for queries on a non-stan-
       dard port number.

       The -t option sets the query type to type .  It can be any
       valid query type which is supported in BIND9.  The default
       query type "A", unless the -x option is supplied to  indi-
       cate  a  reverse lookup.  A zone transfer can be requested
       by specifying a type of AXFR.  When  an  incremental  zone
       transfer  (IXFR) is required, type is set to ixfr=N .  The
       incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to
       the  zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record
       was N .

       Reverse lookups - mapping addresses to names - are simpli-
       fied by the -x option.  addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-
       decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address.  When
       this  option is used, there is no need to provide the name
       , class and type arguments.  dig automatically performs  a
       lookup  for  a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets
       the query type and class to PTR and IN  respectively.   By
       default,  IPv6  addresses are looked up using the IP6.ARPA
       domain and binary labels as defined in  RFC2874.   To  use
       the  older  RFC1886  method  using  the IP6.INT domain and
       "nibble" labels, specify the -n (nibble) option.

       To sign the DNS queries sent by dig  and  their  responses
       using  transaction  signatures  (TSIG), specify a TSIG key
       file using the -k option.  You can also specify  the  TSIG
       key  itself  on the command line using the -y option; name
       is the name of the TSIG key and key  is  the  actual  key.
       The key is a base-64 encoded string,
        typically generated by Caution should be taken when using
       the -y option on multi-user systems as the key can be vis-
       ible  in  the  output from or in the shell's history file.
       When using TSIG authentication with dig , the name  server
       that  is  queried needs to know the key and algorithm that
       is being used.  In BIND, this is done by providing  appro-
       priate key and server statements in named.conf .

                                                                2

       dig  provides  a  number of query options which affect the
       way in which lookups are made and the  results  displayed.
       Some  of these set or reset flag bits in the query header,
       some determine which sections of the answer  get  printed,
       and others determine the timeout and retry strategies.

       Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a
       plus sign: "+".  Some keywords set  or  reset  an  option.
       These  may  be  preceded  by the string "no" to negate the
       meaning of that keyword.  Other keywords assign values  to
       options  like  the  timeout  interval.  They have the form
       +keyword=value .  The query options are: Use [do not  use]
       TCP  when querying name servers.  The default behaviour is
       to use UDP unless an AXFR or IXFR query is  requested,  in
       which case a TCP connection is used.  Use [do not use] TCP
       when querying name  servers.   This  alternate  syntax  to
       +[no]tcp  is  provided  for  backwards compatibility.  The
       "vc" stands for "virtual circuit".  Ignore  truncation  in
       UDP  responses  instead of retrying with TCP.  By default,
       TCP retries are performed.  Set the default domain to som-
       ename   ,  as  if  specified  in  a  domain  directive  in
       /etc/resolv.conf .  Use [do not use] the  search  list  in
       resolv.conf  (if  any).   The  search  list is not used by
       default.  Use [do not use] the  default  domain  name,  if
       any, in resolv.conf The default is not to append that name
       to name when making queries.  This  option  does  nothing.
       It  is  provided for compatibilty with old versions of dig
       where it set an unimplemented resolver flag.  Set [do  not
       set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the query.  The AD bit
       currently has a standard meaning only in responses, not in
       queries,  but  the  ability to set the bit in the query is
       provided for  completeness.   Set  [do  not  set]  the  CD
       (checking  disabled)  bit in the query.  This requests the
       server to not  perform  DNSSEC  validation  of  responses.
       Toggle  the  setting  of the RD (recursion desired) bit in
       the query.  This bit is set by default, which means dig  .
       normally  sends recursive queries.  Recursion is automati-
       cally disabled when the +nssearch or +trace query  options
       are  used.   When this option is set, dig attempts to find
       the authoritative name servers for the zone containing the
       name  being looked up and display the SOA record that each
       name server has for the zone.  Toggle tracing of the dele-
       gation  path from the root name servers for the name being
       looked up.  Tracing is disabled by default.  When  tracing
       is  enabled,  dig  makes  iterative queries to resolve the
       name being looked up.  It will follow referrals  from  the
       root servers, showing the answer from each server that was
       used to resolve the lookup.  toggles the printing  of  the
       initial  comment  in the output identifying the version of
       dig and the query options that have  been  applied.   This
       comment  is  printed  by default.  Provide a terse answer.
       The default is to print the  answer  in  a  verbose  form.
       Show  [or do not show] the IP address and port number that

                                                                3

       supplied the answer when the +short option is enabled.  If
       short  form  answers  are requested, the default is not to
       show the source address and port number of the server that
       provided  the answer.  Toggle the display of comment lines
       in the output.  The default is to  print  comments.   This
       query  option toggles the printing of statistics: when the
       query was made, the size of the  reply  and  so  on.   The
       default behaviour is to print the query statistics.  Print
       [do not print] the query as it is  sent.   before  sending
       the  query.   By default, the query is not printed.  Print
       [do not print] the question section of  a  query  when  an
       answer  is returned.  The default is to print the question
       section as a comment.  Display [do not display] the answer
       section  of  a reply.  The default is to display it.  Dis-
       play [do not display] the authority section  of  a  reply.
       The  default  is  to display it.  Display [do not display]
       the additional section of a reply.  The default is to dis-
       play  it.  Set or clear all display flags Sets the timeout
       for a query to T seconds.  The default time out is 5  sec-
       onds.  An attempt to set T to less than 1 will result in a
       query timeout of 1 second being applied.  Sets the  number
       of  times  to  retry UDP queries to server to T instead of
       the default, 3.  If T is less than or equal to  zero,  the
       number  of  retries  is silently rounded up to 1.  Set the
       number of dots that have to appear in name to D for it  to
       be considered absolute.  The default value is that defined
       using the ndots statement in /etc/resolv.conf , or 1 if no
       ndots  statement  is  present.   Names with fewer dots are
       interpreted as relative names and will be searched for  in
       the  domains  listed  in the search or domain directive in
       /etc/resolv.conf .  Set the UDP message buffer size adver-
       tised  using  EDNS0  to  B bytes.  The maximum and minimum
       sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0 respectively.  Values
       outside this range are rounded up or down appropriately.

       The  BIND 9 implementation of dig supports specifying mul-
       tiple queries on the command line (in addition to support-
       ing  the -f batch file option).  Each of those queries can
       be supplied with its own set of flags, options  and  query
       options.

       In this case, query1 , query2 and so on represent an indi-
       vidual query in the command-line syntax  described  above.
       Each  consists  of  any of the standard options and flags,
       the name to be looked up, an optional query type and class
       and  any  query  options  that  should  be applied to that
       query.

       A global set of query options, which should be applied  to
       all  queries,  can  also  be supplied.  These global query
       options must precede the first tuple of name, class, type,
       options,  flags, and query options supplied on the command
       line.  Any global query options can  be  overridden  by  a

       query-specific set of query options.  For example: dig +qr
       www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr

       shows how dig could be used from the command line to  make
       three  lookups:  an  ANY query for www.isc.org , a reverse
       lookup of 127.0.0.1 and a query  for  the  NS  records  of
       isc.org  .   A  global  query option of +qr is applied, so
       that dig shows the initial query it made for each  lookup.
       The  final  query  has a local query option of +noqr which
       means that dig will not print the initial  query  when  it
       looks up the NS records for isc.org .
