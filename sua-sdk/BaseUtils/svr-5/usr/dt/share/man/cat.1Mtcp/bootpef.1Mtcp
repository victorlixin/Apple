       Internet  Bootstrap  Protocol  (BOOTP)  BOOTREPLY  packets
       include  a  fixed-length (64 bytes) field in which vendor-
       extension information is sent. This information  may  need
       to  exceed this limit.  The bootpef command provides a way
       around this limitation by compiling  the  vendor-extension
       information  into  a file. The name of the file, called an
       ``extension path'', is sent in the vendor-extension  field
       of  the  BOOTREPLY  packet. When the BOOTP client requests
       and receives this file, it interprets the file as it would
       the vendor-extension field.

       When  run  without options, bootpef reads the default con-
       figuration file /etc/bootptab looking for entries contain-
       ing  the ef tag.  See When bootpef finds such an entry, it
       compiles the vendor-extension information  of  that  entry
       into  the  file  specified  with  the ef tag.  If the file
       pathname begins with a slash (/), bootpef  interprets  the
       pathname to be an absolute pathname.  If the file pathname
       does not begin with a slash, bootpef creates the  pathname
       relative to its current directory.

       If  any  client_name arguments are specified, then bootpef
       searches the database configuration file  for  a  hostname
       that  matches client_name and compiles the extension files
       for only those client entries.  When no client_name  argu-
       ments  are  specified, bootpef compiles all client entries
       with an ef tag.

       Sets the current directory used by bootpef while  creating
       extension  files.   This is useful when the extension file
       names are specified  as  relative  pathnames  and  bootpef
       needs to use the same current directory as the TFTP server
       (typically /tftpboot).  Sets the debug_level variable that
       controls  the amount of debugging messages generated.  For
       example, ``-D1'' or ``-D 1'' will set the debugging  level
       to  1.   Recognized  values are 0, 1, 2, and 3 or greater.
       Zero generates no messages and 1 to 3 generate  increasing
       amounts of messages.  Specifying an integer over 3 has the
       same result as specifying 3.  Allows  specification  of  a
       different  database  configuration  file  than the default
       /etc/bootptab.
