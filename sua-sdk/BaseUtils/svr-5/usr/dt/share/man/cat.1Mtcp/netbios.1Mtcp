       The  /etc/netbios  script  starts or stops .  The argument
       (start or stop) specifies the action  to  be  taken.  When
       starting  , netbios reads and exports configuration infor-
       mation to be used by the  daemon, If the /etc/lmhosts file
       exists,  the  script  also calls nbtstat -R which adds all
       remote host entries in /etc/lmhosts to the internal   name
       cache.   netbios  reads  the file /etc/inet/nb.conf, which
       should set the following environment  variables:  Internet
       address  of  interface  to  be  used. Possible values are:
       Enable  only to run over interfaces specified by the given
       IP  addresses.   The  IP  addresses must belong to network
       adapters in the local system.   The  configured  interface
       addresses  cannot  be changed using the -i option to Allow
       to configure itself automatically itself for all available
       subnetworks.   Force   only  to  run locally.  This should
       only be used for testing.  Default maximum number of pend-
       ing  Control Blocks (NCBs) per  user environment.  Default
       maximum number of active sessions per   user  environment.
       Time  in seconds to enable keep alive messages.  If set to
       -1, no keep alive messages will be used.  If set to  zero,
       keep  alive  messages will be enabled for the default idle
       time.  Maximum number of names a user may register.  Maxi-
       mum number of NCBs that may be configured.  Maximum number
       of sessions that may be configured.  The methods that  may
       be  employed  to  search  for  a service name if it is not
       found in the  name table.  Possible values  are:  Use  the
       standard   broadcast  mechanism only.  Use DNS.  Call WINS
       (Windows Internet Name Service) name server(s). At least a
       primary WINS server must be defined using NB_WINS_PRIMARY.
       These mechanisms may be combined in any order in a  comma-
       separated  list.  The  default  search  order is: NB_NAME-
       SEARCH=bc,resolv This  uses  the  broadcast  mechanism  to
       search  for a service name if it is not found in the  name
       table. If this fails, it then tries DNS.

       The recommended search order  when  WINS  is  in  use  is:
       NB_NAMESEARCH=wins,bc,resolv
        scope  name  string. This is used to fully qualify names.
       Only use this variable if you have multiple  logical  net-
       works  running  on  the  same  physical  network. For more
       information on  scope identifiers, see The IP address  (in
       dotted-decimal  format) of the WINS server that will first
       be approached with a name registration, query, or  release
       request.  The default value is 0.0.0.0 which means that no
       server is defined.  The IP address (in dotted-decimal for-
       mat)  of  the  WINS  server that will be approached with a
       name registration, query, or release request if  the  pri-
       mary  WINS  server  does not respond (that is, the request
       times out).  The default value is 0.0.0.0 which means that
       no server is defined.

                                                                1
