       The  rlogind  command  is the server for the program.  The
       server provides a remote login facility  with  authentica-
       tion based on privileged port numbers.

   OOppttiioonnss
       rlogind  understands  the  following  options:  Verify the
       address of the remote host.  Prevent authentication  based
       on  a user's .rhosts file unless the user is logging in as
       root.    Disable   transport-level   keepalive   messages.
       Keepalive  messages allows sessions to be timed out if the
       client crashes or becomes unreachable.

       rlogind is invoked by when a remote  login  connection  is
       established,  and  executes  the  following  protocol: The
       server checks the remote client's  source  port.   If  the
       port  is  not in the range 512-1023, the server aborts the
       connection.  The server checks the remote client's  source
       address.   If  an  entry  for  the  client  exists in both
       /etc/hosts and /etc/hosts.equiv or ~/.rhosts, a user  log-
       ging  in  from  the client is not prompted for a password.
       If the address is associated with a host for which no cor-
       responding   entry  exists  in  /etc/hosts,  the  user  is
       prompted for a password, regardless of whether or  not  an
       entry for the remote client is present in /etc/hosts.equiv
       or ~/.rhosts (see and Once the  source  port  and  address
       have  been  checked, rlogind invokes a login process.  The
       login process is an instance of the in.login scheme, which
       is  based  on  The  login  process  is invoked with the -R
       option to indicate that it is originated by rlogind.   The
       login  process proceeds with the authentication process as
       described in but if  automatic  authentication  fails,  it
       reprompts  the  user  to  login as one finds on a standard
       terminal line.

       In normal operation, a packet protocol is invoked to  pro-
       vide ctrlS / ctrlQ type facilities and propagate interrupt
       signals to the remote commands.  The login process  propa-
       gates  the  client terminal's baud rate and terminal type,
       as found in the environment variable, TERM; see

       All diagnostic messages are  returned  on  the  connection
       associated  with  the stderr, after which any network con-
       nections are closed.  An error is indicated by  a  leading
       byte  with  a  value  of  1.   No  entry  in the host name
       database existed for the client's machine.  A fork by  the
       server  failed.   The  user's  login  shell  could  not be
       started.

       The  authentication  procedure  used  here   assumes   the
       integrity  of  each  client  machine  and  the  connecting
       medium.  This is insecure, but is useful  in  an  ``open''
       environment.

       A  facility  to  allow  all data exchanges to be encrypted
       should be present.
