       The  ftpshut command provides an automated shutdown proce-
       dure that root can use to notify FTP users  when  the  FTP
       server is shutting down.

       time  is  the  time  at  which  ftpshut will bring the FTP
       servers down.  It may be the word now, indicating an imme-
       diate  shutdown,  or  specify  a future time in one of two
       formats: Bring the FTP servers  down  in  number  minutes.
       Bring  the  FTP servers down at the time of day indicated,
       using the 24-hour clock format.  NOTE: You can  only  only
       specify  a  time  between  the  current  time and ``2359''
       (23:59).  Ten minutes before shutdown (or  immediately  if
       ftpshut  is  scheduled  for less than ten minutes) new FTP
       access will be disabled. This time may be  adjusted  using
       the -l option.

       Five minutes before shutdown (or immediately if ftpshut is
       scheduled for less than five minutes) all current FTP con-
       nections  will be disconnected.  This time may be adjusted
       using the -d option.

       The warning messages are formatted  to  be  75  characters
       wide.   ftpshut  knows  about  the actual string length of
       magic cookies.

       The following magic cookies are available: current working
       directory  time  at  which  current  connections  will  be
       dropped the maintainer's email address as defined  in  the
       ftpaccess  file  free space in filesystem of CWD (in kilo-
       bytes) local host name maximum allowed number of users  in
       this  class  current number of users in this class time at
       which new connections will be denied remote host name time
       at  which  system  is  going  to shut down local time (for
       example, Thu Nov 15 17:12:42 1990) username given at login
       time
