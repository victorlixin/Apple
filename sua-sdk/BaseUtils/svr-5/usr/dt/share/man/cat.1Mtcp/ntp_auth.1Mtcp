       ntp_authspeed  is used to calculate values for the authde-
       lay entry in /etc/inet/ntp.conf (see

       When  run  on  a  sample  keys  file   (sample_keys_file),
       ntp_authspeed  will output suggested values for authdelay.

       Computes and displays the actual cost of the computations,
       rather  than displaying the suggested value for authdelay.
       Enables debugging output.   Computes  the  delay  for  MD5
       authentication.  This is the default as DES authentication
       is not currently supported, but  the  option  remains  for
       backward   compatibility.   Perform  number  computational
       loops instead of the default of 20000 (or 2000  if  -c  is
       used).  The format of the key entries is described in Only
       key entries of type ``M'' for MD5 authentication are  sup-
       ported at this time.
