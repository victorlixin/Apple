       map-mbone attempts to display all multicast  routers  that
       are  reachable  from the multicast starting_router. If not
       specified, the default starting_router is the local  host.

       map-mbone traverses neighboring multicast routers by send-
       ing the IGMP message ASK_NEIGHBORS to the multicast start-
       ing  router.  If the router responds, it includes the ver-
       sion number and a list  of  neighboring  multicast  router
       addresses in the response.  If the responding router has a
       recent multicast version number, map-mbone requests  addi-
       tional  information  such as metrics, thresholds and flags
       from the multicast router. If the flooding option has been
       selected,  map-mbone  asks each multicast router mentioned
       in the response for a list of its neighbors.  This  search
       for unique routers continues until no new neighboring mul-
       ticast routers are reported.

       Only root can run map-mbone.

       map-mbone understands the following options: Set the debug
       level. If debug_level is greater than the default value of
       0,  map-mbone  displays  additional  debugging   messages.
       Regardless  of the debug level, map-mbone will always out-
       put an error message and terminate if an error occurs. The
       debug  levels  are:  Print  packet warnings to stderr.  As
       level 1 with the addition of printing notification of down
       networks  to  stderr.  As levels 1 and 2 with the addition
       of printing notification of all packet timeouts to stderr.
       Turn  on  flooding; this allows recursive search of multi-
       cast routes. This  is  enabled  by  default  if  a  start-
       ing_router is not specified.  Set graphing in GraphEd for-
       mat.  Disable DNS for multicast  router  names.   Set  the
       limit  on  the number of times to try querying a neighbor.
       The default limit is 1 retry.  Set the number  of  seconds
       to  wait  for a neighbor to reply to a query before retry-
       ing. The default timeout is 2 seconds.
