       The  rwall  command  reads  a  message from standard input
       until EOF.  It then sends this message,  preceded  by  the
       line: Broadcast Message ...  to all users logged in on the
       specified host machines.

UUssaaggee
       A machine can only receive rwall messages if it is running
       rwalld may be started by or

       Note  that  the timeout is fairly short to allow transmis-
       sion to a large group of machines (some of  which  may  be
       down)  in  a  reasonable amount of time.  Thus the message
       may not get through to a heavily loaded machine.
