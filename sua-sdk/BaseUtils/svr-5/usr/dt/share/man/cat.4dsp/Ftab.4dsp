       One  of  the  Installable Driver/Tunable Parameters kernel
       configuration files, an Ftab file, contains specifications
       of  function  tables.  Function tables are null-terminated
       arrays of pointers to functions.  A function table  points
       to all named entry points of a specified type in all stat-
       ically-configured modules.

       When the Ftab component  of  a  module's  Driver  Software
       Package  (DSP) is installed, stores the module's Ftab file
       information  in  /etc/conf/ftab.d/module-name,  where  the
       file   module-name   is  the  name  of  the  module  being
       installed.    Package   scripts   should   never    access
       /etc/conf/ftab.d  files  directly; only the idinstall com-
       mand should be used.

       An Ftab file contains the  following  whitespace-separated
       fields:

       entry  suffix      function table name      return type of
       the function      flags

       All fields are positional and must be separated  by  white
       space.   Blank  lines  and lines beginning with # or * are
       considered comments and are ignored.

       Ftab files only affect older, entry-type 0  modules.   See
       for a description of entry-type.

       Named  entry  points for all statically-configured modules
       that have $entry lines in their  files  that  match  entry
       suffix will be included in the function table.  Each func-
       tion name is constructed by appending the entry suffix  to
       the  prefix from the module's Master file.  Entries in the
       table are arranged according to the  Master  file's  order
       field, in decreasing numeric order.

       The flags field is optional.  The following flags are sup-
       ported: The function table corresponding to the Ftab entry
       is  driver-related.   This  causes  a parallel CPU binding
       table to be generated for that particular function  table.
       The  name  for  the  CPU  binding  table is constructed by
       appending the entry suffix to ``bindcpu_.''  Causes a par-
       allel  module  name  to  be  generated with char * entries
       pointint to the actual module name of the associated  mod-
       ule.  The name for the module-name table is constructed by
       appending the entry suffix to ``modname_.''
