DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       One  of  the  Installable Driver/Tunable Parameters kernel
       configuration files, an  Init  file  contains  information
       used    by   the   command   to   construct   a   module's
       /etc/inittab entry.  When the Init component of a module's
       Driver  Software  Package  (DSP)  is installed, stores the
       module's Init file information in /etc/conf/init.d/module-
       name, where the file module-name is the name of the module
       being installed.   Package  scripts  should  never  access
       /etc/conf/init.d  files  directly; only the idinstall com-
       mand should be used.

       Init files contain lines consisting of one of three forms:
       action:process rstate:action:process id:rstate:action:pro-
       cess

       All fields are positional and must be separated by colons.
       Blank lines and lines beginning with # or * are considered
       comments and are ignored.

       Lines of the first form should be used for  most  entries.
       When  presented with a line of this form, idmkinit: copies
       the action and process field values to the  inittab  entry
       generates  a  valid  id field value (called a ``tag'') and
       prepends it to the entry generates an rstate field with  a
       value  of  2,  and  adds it to the entry, following the id
       field

       Lines of the second form should be  used  when  an  rstate
       value other than 2 must be specified.  When presented with
       a line of this form, idmkinit generates only the id  field
       value and prepends it to the entry.

       Lines of the third form should be used with caution.  When
       presented with a line of this form,  idmkinit  copies  the
       entry  to  the  inittab  file verbatim.  It is recommended
       that DSPs avoid specifying lines of this form because,  if
       more than one DSP or add-on application specifies the same
       id field value,  idmkinit  will  create  multiple  inittab
       entries containing this id value.  When the /etc/init pro-
       gram attempts to process the inittab entries with the same
       id, it will fail with an error condition.

       Note  that idmkinit determines which of the three forms is
       being used by searching each line for a valid action  key-
       word.   Valid  action  values are: boot           bootwait
       initdefault         off            once           ondemand
       powerfail      powerwait respawn             sysinit wait
