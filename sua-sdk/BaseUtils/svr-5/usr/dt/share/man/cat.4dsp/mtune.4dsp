       One  of  the Installable Driver/Tunables Parameters kernel
       configuration files, an Mtune file,  contains  definitions
       of  tunable  parameters,  including  default values, for a
       kernel module.  System-specific tunable values are  stored
       in  stune.   When the Mtune component of a module's Driver
       Software Package (DSP) is installed, stores  the  module's
       Mtune  file  information in /etc/conf/mtune.d/module-name,
       where the file module-name is the name of the module being
       installed.     Package   scripts   should   never   access
       /etc/conf/mtune.d files directly; only the  idinstall  and
       idtune commands should be used.

       Each  integer tunable parameter is specified on a separate
       line of the form: parameter-name    default-value    mini-
       mum-value   maximum-value

       Each  string  tunable parameter is specified on a separate
       line of the form: parameter-name   default-value

       All fields are positional and must be separated  by  white
       space.   Blank  lines  and lines beginning with # or * are
       considered comments and are ignored.

       The Mtune file fields are: A string (maximum of 20 charac-
       ters)  used  to  construct  the preprocessor #defines that
       pass the value for this parameter to the system  when  the
       system  is built (see Specifies the default value for this
       tunable parameter.  If the value is not overridden by  the
       file,  this  value  will be used when the system is built.
       Specifies the minimum allowable  value  for  this  tunable
       parameter.  If the parameter is tuned by command, the com-
       mand will check that the new value specified is  equal  to
       or  greater than this value.  Specifies the maximum allow-
       able value for this tunable parameter.  If  the  parameter
       is  tuned  by command, the command will check that the new
       value specified is equal to or less than this value.

       For compatibility with existing add-on DSP packages, main-
       tains a flat file,  /etc/conf/cf.d/mtune,  which  contains
       all of the tunable parameters.  Existing packages can read
       this file to find existing values, and can add tunables to
       the  file.  This mechanism is discouraged for any new add-
       on DSP package, however; new packages should use the idin-
       stall(1M) and idtune(1M) commands.
