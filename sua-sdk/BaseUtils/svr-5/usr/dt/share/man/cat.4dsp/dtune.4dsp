       A  Dtune  file  is  one  of the Installable Driver/Tunable
       Parameters  kernel  configuration  files.    It   contains
       descriptions of tunable parameters.  When the Dtune compo-
       nent of  a  module's  Driver  Software  Package  (DSP)  is
       installed,  stores  the module's Dtune file information in
       /etc/conf/dtune.d/module-name, where the file  module-name
       is  the  name  of  the  module  being  installed.  Package
       scripts  should  never  access   /etc/conf/dtune.d   files
       directly;  instead  use  the  idinstall(1M) and idtune(1M)
       commands.

       For each integer and string tunable parameter in an  Mtune
       file, there is an associated Dtune entry.

       Special  lines are identified by one or more percent signs
       (%) followed by a space at the start of a  line.   Identi-
       fies  the  highest  level  category of tunable parameters.
       This heading line is used for the initial display  of  the
       System_Tuner   available  through  the  UnixWare  desktop.
       Identifies a sub-category of  tunable  parameters.   Addi-
       tional  %s  can  be  used  to create an hierarchy of cate-
       gories.  Identifies the tunable parameter.  This  line  is
       followed  by  one  or more lines of text that describe the
       specific tunable parameter.  This line identifies the text
       for  a  category description.  The category must match the
       category on another line that starts with a minimum of two
       %s.

       The following is an example of a Dtune file: %% Networking
       Parameters %C Networking Parameters There are several cat-
       egories  of  Networking Parameters including Internet Con-
       trol Message Protocol (ICMP), Internet Protocol (IP),  and
       Transport  Control  Protocol (TCP).  %%% Internet Protocol
       (IP) Parameters % IPCKSUM Controls  whether  IP  (Internet
       Protocol)  checksumming is enabled.  By default, IP check-
       summing is turned on (set to non-zero).  Except  when  the
       underlying  hardware  guarantees  correct  and uncorrupted
       delivery of all  packets,  this  parameter  should  remain
       turned  on.   % IPFORWARDING Controls whether ip will for-
       ward packets; that is, whether it will act as  a  gateway.
       This  parameter should be turned on (set to non-zero) only
       if the machine is intended to be a gateway.  % IPSENDREDI-
       RECTS  Controls  whether  ip  will generate ICMP (Internet
       Control Message Protocol) redirect messages when  forward-
       ing  packets  to  a  destination that the sender should be
       able to reach directly.  This should be turned on (set  to
       non-zero) only if needed to support diskless workstations,
       or if the machine is acting as a router or  gateway.   The
       &geminiREL; System Tuner currently displays only one level
       of category.
