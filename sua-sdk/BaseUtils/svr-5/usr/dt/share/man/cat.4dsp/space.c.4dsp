       space  is  an ASCII file that gives information about disk
       space requirements for the target environment.  It defines
       space  needed beyond that which is used by objects defined
       in the prototype file--for example, files  which  will  be
       installed with the installf command.  It should define the
       maximum amount of additional space which  a  package  will
       require.

       The  generic  format  of  a line in this file is: pathname
       blocks  inodes

       Definitions for the fields are  as  follows:  Specifies  a
       directory name which may or may not be the mount point for
       a filesystem.  Names that do not begin with  a  slash  (/)
       indicate  relocatable  directories.  Defines the number of
       disk blocks required for installation  of  the  files  and
       directory  entries  contained  in  the  pathname  (using a
       512-byte  block  size).   Defines  the  number  of  inodes
       required  for  installation  of  the  files  and directory
       entries contained in the pathname.
