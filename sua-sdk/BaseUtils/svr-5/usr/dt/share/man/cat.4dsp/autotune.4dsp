       One  of  the  Installable Driver/Tunable Parameters kernel
       configuration files, the Autotune  file  contains  defini-
       tions  for  the  default,  minimum, and maximum values for
       tunables that should change with the amount of memory pre-
       sent.   Lines in the /etc/conf/cf.d/mtune file are created
       for these variables based on this information.  The infor-
       mation  is also passed to the kernel as a structure in the
       /etc/conf/pack.d/module-name/tune.c file.  This is used to
       retune  the  tunable  at boot time, if the memory size has
       changed.  The autotuning can be overridden by using  Auto-
       tune  files exist on a per-module basis, for those modules
       that have autotuned parameters.  stores the module's Auto-
       tune file information in /etc/conf/autotune.d/module-name,
       where the file module-name is the name of the module being
       installed.     Package   scripts   should   never   access
       /etc/conf/autotune.d files directly;  only  the  idinstall
       and idtune commands should be used.

       Each  tunable  is specified on multiple lines of the form:
       parameter-name record-type linear-or-step memsize value

       All fields are positional and must be separated  by  white
       space.   Blank  lines  and lines beginning with # or * are
       considered comments and ignored.

       The Autotune file fields are:  A  string  (maximum  of  20
       characters)  used  as the parameter name in the mtune file
       line that is constructed.  A  PHYS  entry  in  this  field
       indicates  that  the parameter is autotuned using a method
       based on the amount of general purpose  memory  available.
       If the record type is PHYS subsequent fields are not used.
       Otherwise, the parameter is autotuned  using  a  (default)
       method  that takes both general purpose and kernel virtual
       memory into account.  In this case,  information  is  pro-
       vided about whether the line pertains to the default value
       (DEF), minimum value (MIN), or maximum value (MAX) in  the
       mtune file line that is constructed.  The string LINEAR or
       STEP is used to indicate how to calculate  the  value  for
       memory sizes in between those specified.  Linear uses lin-
       ear interpolation between the two closest points, or  lin-
       ear  extrapolation  from the last two points if the system
       has more memory than the largest tune point specified, and
       if  the  largest  tune point is specified as LINEAR.  STEP
       will use the value from the next smaller memory size.   If
       the  record type is PHYS this field is not used.  The mem-
       ory size, in megabytes, for which this line specifies  the
       tunable's  minimum,  maximum,  or  default  value.  If the
       record type is PHYS this field is not used.  The value  to
       be  assigned to the tunable's minimum, maximum, or default
       value at the given memory size.  If  the  record  type  is

                                                                1
