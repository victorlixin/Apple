       One of the Installable Driver/Tunable Paramers kernel con-
       figuration files, the /etc/conf/cf.d/stune file,  contains
       tunable parameters for the kernel modules to be configured
       into the next system to be built (see The  parameter  set-
       tings  in  the stune file are used to override the default
       values specified in the mtune file.

       The contents of the stune file will only affect  the  next
       kernel rebuild.  Once the new kernel has been installed to
       /stand and booted, the stune file is copied to  stune.cur-
       rent.  Any change made to the stune.current file using the
       command with the -c option will affect  all  the  loadable
       kernel  modules  subsequently  configured into the running
       system.

       Package scripts should never  access  /etc/conf/cf.d/stune
       or  /etc/conf/cf.d/stune.current  files directly; only the
       command should be used.

       The stune and stune.current files  contain  one  line  for
       each  parameter  to  be set.  Each line contains two posi-
       tional fields separated by  white  space:       parameter-
       name new-value

       Blank  lines  and  lines beginning with ``#'' or ``*'' are
       considered comments and are ignored.

       The stune and stune.current fields are: Specifies the name
       of  the  tunable  parameter, as defined in the Mtune file.
       Specifies the new value to be used to override the default
       value  specified  for  this tunable parameter in the Mtune
       file.  This value must fall within the valid range of val-
       ues specified for this parameter in the Mtune file.
