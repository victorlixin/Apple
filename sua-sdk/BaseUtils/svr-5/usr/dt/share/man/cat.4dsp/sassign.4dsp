       One  of  the  Installable Driver/Tunable Parameters kernel
       configuration files, the Sassign file, gives system admin-
       istrators the ability to assign specific actual devices to
       logical device names used by the kernel.  One  example  is
       rootdev,  which  is  the  device  that  contains  the root
       filesystem.

       When the Sassign component of a module's  Driver  Software
       Package  (DSP)  is  installed, stores the module's Sassign
       file information in /etc/conf/sassign.d/module-name, where
       the  file  module-name  is  the  name  of the module being
       installed.    Package   scripts   should   never    access
       /etc/conf/sassign.d  files  directly;  only  the idinstall
       command should be used.

       If the system administrator wants to  assign  a  different
       actual  device  to  perform  a function, the administrator
       remaps the logical device name for that function to  spec-
       ify  another  configured device in the Sassign file.  Note
       that the kernel must be rebuilt and rebooted for  the  new
       assignment to take affect.

       Each  logical device name in the Sassign file is specified
       on a separate line of the form:       device-variable-pre-
       fix device-module-name minor

       All  fields  are positional and must be separated by white
       space.  Blank lines and  lines  beginning  with  ``#''  or
       ``*'' are considered comments and are ignored.

       The Sassign file fields are: Specifies a prefix identifier
       to be used to construct the  logical  name  by  which  the
       device  is  known.  When the kernel is rebuilt, the suffix
       dev will be appended to this identifier to form  the  full
       logical device name.

       The  logical  device  name will be used to create a global
       variable of type dev_t during the kernel rebuild  process.
       Any  module  that  needs  to  reference the logical device
       should include an extern dev_t declaration for the logical
       device  name  variable.   Identifies  the  name  of actual
       device driver module that is to perform the function asso-
       ciated with this logical device name.  The name must match
       the name defined for the module in the  module-name  field
       of  its  file.  The name must be for a block device except
       when used with the console device variable, which requires
       a  console-capable  character device.  Specifies the minor
       device number which is to  be  assigned  to  this  logical
       device  name.   The major number for the logical device is
       the major number defined for the module identified in  the
       device-module-name field.

                                                                1

       To  create a variable which is intended to always refer to
       the same device, define it as a variable in  the  device's
       Space.c   file,   using   the  PRFX_BMAJOR_X  symbol  from
       /etc/conf/cf.d/config.h, instead of using an Sassign file.
