       The  LDAPMod  structure specifies changes to be made to an
       attribute.  It is defined in ldap.h and contains the  fol-
       lowing members: typedef struct ldapmod {
           int mod_op;
           char *mod_type;
           union {
               char **modv_strvals;
               struct berval **modv_bvals;
           } mod_vals; } LDAPMod;

       #define mod_values mod_vals.modv_strvals #define mod_bval-
       ues mod_vals.modv_bvals The fields in the  structure  have
       the following meanings: Specifies the type of modification
       to perform: The given values are added to the entry,  cre-
       ating  the  attribute  if necessary.  The given values are
       deleted from the entry, removing the attribute if no  val-
       ues  remain. If the entire attribute is to be deleted, the
       mod_values field should be set  to  NULL.   The  attribute
       will have the listed values after the modification, having
       been created if necessary.

       If the new attributes are not string attributes (for exam-
       ple,  a  photo)  then you should OR the specifier with the
       special value LDAP_MOD_BVALUES. For example,  an  addition
       of  a  binary  attribute  is  specified by (LDAP_MOD_ADD |
       LDAP_MOD_BVALUES).  If LDAP_MOD_BVALUES is  set  then  the
       new  value  for  the  attribute is taken from mod_bvalues,
       otherwise from mod_values.  The attribute type to  modify.
       A  pointer to a null-terminated array of string values for
       the attribute.  A pointer to a  null-terminated  array  of
       berval  structures  for  the attribute.  All modifications
       are performed in the order in which they are listed.
