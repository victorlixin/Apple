       The  LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) is used to repre-
       sent LDAP entries in text form. The tools can be  used  to
       convert  from  LDIF  format to the LDBM format used by The
       tool can be used to do the  reverse  conversion.  See  The
       SLAPD  and  SLURPD Administrator's Guide for more informa-
       tion on this format and the conversion tools.

       The basic form of an LDIF entry is as  follows:  [id]  dn:
       distinguished name attrtype: attrvalue attrtype: attrvalue
       ...  where id is the optional entry ID (a positive decimal
       number).  Normally,  you would not supply the id, allowing
       the database creation tools to do that for you. The  ldbm-
       cat   program,  however,  produces  an  LDIF  format  that
       includes id so that new indexes created will be consistent
       with  the  existing  database.  A line may be continued by
       starting the next line with a single space or tab  charac-
       ter. For example: dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen, o=University of
       Michi
        gan, c=US Multiple attribute values are specified on sep-
       arate  lines,  for  example: cn: Barbara J Jensen cn: Babs
       Jensen If an attrvalue contains a non-printing  character,
       or  begins  with  a  space or a colon (:), the attrtype is
       followed by a double colon and the  value  is  encoded  in
       base  64 notation. For example, the value `` begins with a
       space''  would  be  encoded  like  the   following:   cn::
       IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=  Multiple  entries within the
       same LDIF file are separated by blank lines.

       Here is an  example  of  an  LDIF  file  containing  three
       entries.  dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen, o=University of Michi
        gan,  c=US  cn:  Barbara J Jensen cn: Babs Jensen object-
       class: person sn: Jensen

       dn: cn=Bjorn J Jensen, o=University of Michi
        gan, c=US cn: Bjorn J Jensen  cn:  Bjorn  Jensen  object-
       class: person sn: Jensen

       dn: cn=Jennifer J Jensen, o=University of Michi
        gan,  c=US  cn:  Jennifer  J  Jensen  cn: Jennifer Jensen

       encoded using base 64.
