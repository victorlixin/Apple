       slapd is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for  LDAP
       connections on port 389, responding to the LDAP operations
       it receives over these connections.  On startup,  it  nor-
       mally  forks  and  disassociates  itself from the invoking
       tty. If the -d option is given and  debugging  is  set  to
       some  non-zero value, slapd will not fork and disassociate
       from the invoking tty.

       slapd can be configured to provide replicated service  for
       a  database  with the help of slurpd, the stand-alone LDAP
       update replication daemon. See for details.

       slapd daemons can be  started  only  if  the  daemons  are
       listed in the file.  Daemons are started using and stopped
       using Details of their ownership can be checked using

       To ensure that the daemon starts  at  boot  time,  put  an
       entry  in  the  ldaptab  file  with the start at boot time
       option set to on.  ldapstart boot uses this information to
       start the daemon at boot time.

       Active slapd daemons can be displayed using ldapcheck.

       See for more details on slapd.

       Turn  on  debugging  as  defined  by  debug-level. If this
       option is specified, slapd will not fork  or  disassociate
       from  the  invoking  terminal.  Some general operation and
       status messages are printed for any value of  debug-level.
       debug-level is taken as a bit string, with each bit corre-
       sponding to a different  kind  of  debugging  information.
       See  ``Error  levels''  on the manual page.  Tell slapd at
       what level debugging statements should be  logged  to  the
       /var/adm/log/osmlog  file.   See  ``Error  levels'' on the
       manual page.  Specifies the slapd configuration file.  The
       default  is  /etc/slapd.conf.   slapd  will  listen on the
       default LDAP port (389) unless this  option  is  given  to
       override the default.

       To start slapd and have it fork and detach from the termi-
       nal and start serving the LDAP databases  defined  in  the
       default  configuration  file, type: /usr/lib/ldap/slapd To
       start slapd with an alternate configuration file, and turn
       on  voluminous debugging which will be printed on standard
       error, type: /usr/lib/ldap/slapd -f /etc/slapd.conf -d 255
