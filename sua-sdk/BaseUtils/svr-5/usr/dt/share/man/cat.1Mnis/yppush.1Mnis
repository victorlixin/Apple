       The  yppush command copies a new version of the named Net-
       work Information Service (NIS) map  from  the  master  NIS
       server to the slave NIS servers.

       yppush  takes  the following options: Verbose.  Print mes-
       sages when each server is called, and for  each  response.
       If  this flag is omitted, only error messages are printed.
       Specify a ypdomain  other than the default domain.

       yppush is normally run only on the master  NIS  server  by
       the  Makefile  in  /var/yp  after the master databases are
       changed.  It first constructs a list of NIS  server  hosts
       by  reading  the NIS map ypservers within the ypdomain, or
       if the map is not set up, the local file  is  used.   Keys
       within  the  map  ypservers  are  the  ASCII  names of the
       machines on which the NIS servers run.

       A ``transfer map'' request is sent to the  NIS  server  at
       each host, along with the information needed by the trans-
       fer agent (the program that actually  moves  the  map)  to
       call  back  the  yppush.   When  the attempt has completed
       (successfully or not), and the  transfer  agent  has  sent
       yppush  a  status  message,  the results may be printed to
       stdout.  Messages are also printed when a transfer is  not
       possible;  for  instance when the request message is unde-
       liverable, or when the timeout  period  on  responses  has
       expired.

       Refer to and for an overview of the NIS service.
