       The ypinit command sets up the Network Information Service
       (NIS) on a server or a client.  It can  also  be  used  to
       remove NIS configuration from a system.

       ypinit  can be used to set up an NIS master server, an NIS
       slave server, or an NIS client.  To run ypinit,  you  must
       be  the NIS administrator root with the appropriate privi-
       leges.  It asks  a  few  self-explanatory  questions,  and
       reports success or failure to the terminal.

       ypinit  sets  up a master server using the simple model in
       which that server is master to all maps in the data  base.
       This  is the way to bootstrap the NIS system; later if you
       want you can change the association of maps to masters.

       All databases are built from scratch, either from informa-
       tion  available  to  the  program  at runtime, or from the
       ASCII data base files in /etc.  These files should  be  in
       their  ``traditional''  form,  rather than the abbreviated
       form used on client machines.

       An NIS database on a slave server is set up by copying  an
       existing  database from a running server.  The master-name
       argument should be the hostname of a  NIS  server  (either
       the  master  server for all the maps, or a server on which
       the data base is up-to-date and stable).  If you  want  to
       modify the list of maps that a slave slaver will initially
       request  from   the   master   server,   edit   the   file
       /var/yp/YPMAPS  on the slave server before running ypinit.
       To set up a client, ypinit  prompts  for  a  list  of  NIS
       servers to bind the client to, this list should be ordered
       from closest to farthest server.

       Refer to and for an overview of the NIS service.

       ypinit takes the following options: Set up a  client  sys-
       tem.   Indicate  that the local host is to be the NIS mas-
       ter.  Remove NIS configuration from a system.  This  stops
       the  NIS  daemons,  deletes /etc/inet/nis.conf, unsets the
       NIS domain name, removes  any  tcpip_nis.so  entries  from
       /etc/netconfig,    and    deletes   the   symbolic   links

                                                                1

       /usr/lib/ns.so and /usr/lib/ns.so.1.  It does not undo any
       changes  that  the administrator has made to files such as
       /etc/passwd or /etc/group.  Set up a slave database.
