       The makedbm command takes infile and converts it to a pair
       of files in  format  named  outfile.pag  and  outfile.dir.
       Each  line  of the input file is converted to a single dbm
       record.

   OOppttiioonnss
       makedbm takes the following options:  Lowercase.   Convert
       the keys of the given map to lower case, so that host name
       matches, for example, can work  independent  of  upper  or
       lower  case distinctions.  Secure map.  Accept connections
       from secure NIS networks only.   Create  a  special  entry
       with  the  key yp_input_file.  Create a special entry with
       the key yp_output_name.  Create a special entry  with  the
       key  yp_domain_name.   Create a special entry with the key
       yp_master_name.  If no  master  host  name  is  specified,
       yp_master_name will be set to the local host name.  Undo a
       dbm file.  That is, print out a dbm  file  one  entry  per
       line, with a single space separating keys from values.

UUssaaggee
       All characters up to the first
        or   form  the key, and the rest of the line is the data.
       If a line ends with ``\'', then the data for  that  record
       is  continued  on  to  the  next line.  It is left for NIS
       clients to interpret ``#''; makedbm does not itself  treat
       it as a comment character.

       infile  can  be ``-'', in which case the standard input is
       read.

       makedbm is meant to be used in generating  dbm  files  for
       NIS  and  it  generates  a  special  entry  with  the  key
       yp_last_modified, which is the date of infile (or the cur-
       rent time, if infile is ``-'').
