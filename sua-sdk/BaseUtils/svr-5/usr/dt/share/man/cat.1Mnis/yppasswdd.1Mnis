       yppasswdd is an Network Information Service  (NIS)  server
       that  handles  password  change requests from It changes a
       password entry in passwdfile  and  shadowfile,  which  are
       assumed to be in the format of and

       passwdfile  is  the  password file that provides the basis
       for the passwd.byname and passwd.byuid  maps.   shadowfile
       is  where  the  encrypted  passwords  are  kept, which are
       needed to create password maps.

       When  passwdfile   and   shadowfile   are   the   server's
       /etc/passwd  and  /etc/shadow  files,  the command will be
       used to update the I&A security database.  However,  since
       they  contain  an  entry  for the super user, it is recom-
       mended that these files not be used.

       If the -noshell, -nogecos, or  -nopw  options  are  given,
       then these fields may not be changed remotely using or

       If  the -m option is given, then after passwdfile is modi-
       fied, a will be performed in /var/yp.  Any arguments  fol-
       lowing the flag will be passed to make.

       This  server  is  not run on the master server by default.
       It can be enabled as described in

       If  the  NIS  password  and  shadow  files  are  stored as
       /var/yp/passwd and /var/yp/shadow, then to  have  password
       changes   propagated  immediately  the  server  should  be
       invoked        as:        /usr/lib/netsvc/yp/rpc.yppasswdd
       /var/yp/passwd -m passwd DIR=/var/yp
