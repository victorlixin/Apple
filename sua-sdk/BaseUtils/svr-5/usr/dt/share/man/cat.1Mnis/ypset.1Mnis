       The  ypset command tells ypbind to get Network Information
       Service (NIS) services for the specified ypdomain from the
       ypserv  process  running on server.  If server is down, or
       is not running ypserv, this is not  discovered  until  the
       NIS  client process tries to get a binding for the domain.
       At this point, the binding set by ypset will be tested  by
       ypbind.  If the binding is invalid, ypbind will attempt to
       rebind for the same domain.

   OOppttiioonnss
       ypset takes the following options: Set ypbind's binding on
       host,  instead  of  locally.   host must be specified as a
       name.  Use ypdomain, instead of the default domain.

       In order to run ypset, ypbind must be initiated  with  the
       -ypset or -ypsetme options.  See

       ypset  is useful for binding a client node which is not on
       a broadcast net, or is on a broadcast  net  which  is  not
       running the NIS server host.  It also is useful for debug-
       ging NIS client applications, for instance where  the  NIS
       map only exists at a single NIS server.

       In  cases where several hosts on the local net are supply-
       ing NIS services, it is possible for ypbind to  rebind  to
       another  host  even  while  you attempt to find out if the
       ypset operation succeeded.  For example, you can enter:  #
       ypset  host1 # ypwhich host2 which can be confusing.  This
       is a function of the NIS subsystem's attempt to  load-bal-
       ance  among  the  available  NIS  servers, and occurs when
       host1 does not respond to ypbind because it is not running
       ypserv (or is overloaded), and host2, running ypserv, gets
       the binding.

       server indicates the NIS server to bind to,  and  must  be
       specified  as a name.  This will work only if the node has
       a current valid binding for the domain  in  question,  and
       ypbind has been set to allow use of ypset.  In most cases,
       server should be specified as an IP address.

       ypset tries to  bind  ypbind  over  a  datagram  transport
       first.   Datagram  Transports  are  recommended for higher
       performance.  The  NIS  library  calls,  yp_enum,  yp_all,
       yp_next, and yp_first use circuit transports regardless of
       the ``main'' transport being used.

       Refer to and for an overview of the NIS service.
