       The  file  called Makefile in /var/yp is used to build the
       Network Information Service (NIS) database.

       If is installed on your system, use the first form of  the
       synopsis  to  build  the  NIS  database.   If  make is not
       installed, execute /var/yp/ypbuild as shown in the  second
       form of the synopsis to build the NIS database.

       With no arguments, make (or ypbuild) creates dbm databases
       for any NIS maps that are out-of-date, and  then  executes
       to notify slave databases that there has been a change.

       If  map is supplied on the command line, make (or ypbuild)
       will update that map only.

       There  are  three  special  variables  used  by  make  (or
       ypbuild)  in  the Makefile: DIR, which gives the directory
       of the source files; NOPUSH, which when non-null  inhibits
       doing a yppush of the new database files; and DOM, used to
       construct a domain other than the master's default domain.
       The default for DIR is /etc, and the default for NOPUSH is
       the null string.

       make (or ypbuild) also creates entries in /var/yp/aliases.
       These  entries  are  generated by /usr/sbin/ypalias, which
       takes a string as input and returns the alias derived from
       that string.

       Refer to and for an overview of the NIS service.

       If  your  machine  is running the Enhanced Security Utili-
       ties, you must use  ypbuild  instead  of  make  .   Invoke
       ypbuild  with  its  full pathname and specify a shell that
       can inherit privileges.
