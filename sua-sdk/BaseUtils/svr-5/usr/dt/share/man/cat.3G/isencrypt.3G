       isencrypt uses heuristics to determine whether a buffer of
       characters is encrypted.  It  requires  two  arguments:  a
       pointer  to an array of characters and the number of char-
       acters in the buffer.

       isencrypt assumes that the file is not  encrypted  if  all
       the  characters  in  the first block are ASCII characters.
       If there are non-ASCII  characters  in  the  first  ninbuf
       characters, isencrypt assumes that the buffer is encrypted
       if the setlocale LC_CTYPE category is set to C or ascii.

       If the LC_CTYPE category is set to a value other than C or
       ascii,  then isencrypt uses a combination of heuristics to
       determine if the buffer is encrypted.  If  ninbuf  has  at
       least  64  characters, a chi-square test is used to deter-
       mine if the bytes in the buffer have a  uniform  distribu-
       tion;  and isencrypt assumes the buffer is encrypted if it
       does.  If the buffer has less than 64 characters, a  check
       is  made for null characters and a terminating new-line to
       determine whether the buffer is encrypted.

       If the buffer is encrypted, 1 is returned; otherwise  zero
       is returned.
