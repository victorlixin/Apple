       pathfind searches the directories named in  path  for  the
       file name.  The directories named in path are separated by
       colons.  mode is a string of option  letters  chosen  from
       the set rwxfbcdpugks:
       ---------------------------
       Letter   Meaning
       ---------------------------
       _rr        readable
       _ww        writable
       _xx        executable
       _ff        normal file
       _bb        block special
       _cc        character special
       _dd        directory
       _pp        FIFO (pipe)
       _uu        set user ID bit
       _gg        set group ID bit
       _kk        sticky bit
       _ss        size nonzero

       Options  read,  write, and execute are checked relative to
       the real (not the effective) user ID and group ID  of  the
       current process.

       If  the  file name, with all the characteristics specified
       by mode, is found in any of the directories  specified  by
       path, then pathfind returns a pointer to a string contain-
       ing the member of path, followed by a slash character (/),
       followed by name.

       If  name begins with a slash, it is treated as an absolute
       path name, and path is ignored.

       An empty path member is treated as the current  directory.
       rather, the unadorned name is returned.

       If  no  match  is  found, pathname returns a null pointer,
