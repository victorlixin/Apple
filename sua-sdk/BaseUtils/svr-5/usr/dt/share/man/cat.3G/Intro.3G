       This section contains manual pages for the routines in the
       libgen general-purpose library.

       This library is not implemented as a shared object and  is
       not  automatically  linked  by  the  C compilation system.
       Specify -lgen on  the  command  line  to  link  with  this
       library.

       For  functions  that  return a floating-point value, if an
       error occurs, the value of errno will be one of the values
       represented  by  the  manifest  constants  EDOM  or ERANGE
       (defined in math.h).  EDOM typically  indicates  a  domain
       error:  one  of  the input values was not in the domain of
       the function.  ERANGE typically indicates a  range  error:
       the  calculated  result was either too big or too small to
       be represented by the data type returned by the  function.

       Functions  that  result  in a range error typically return
       zero for underflow or a value that will compare  equal  to
       +-HUGE_VAL  for  overflow.  HUGE_VAL is defined in math.h.
       On systems that support IEEE infinity, HUGE_VAL is  infin-
       ity.

       If  the system supports IEEE NaN (not-a-number), functions
       that result in a domain error typically return NaN.   Such
       functions  may  also  raise one of the IEEE floating-point
       exceptions.  On systems that  do  not  support  IEEE  NaN,
       functions  that  result in a domain error typically return
       zero.

       The error behavior for  programs  compiled  with  the  -Xt
       (transitional)  compilation mode is different (see In that
       case, these functions typically  return  zero  instead  of
       IEEE  NaN  for domain errors and a value that will compare
       equal to +-HUGE instead of +-HUGE_VAL for overflows.  HUGE
       is defined in math.h.

       A  character (except a multibyte character; see is any bit
       pattern able to fit into a byte on the machine.  The  null
       character is a character with value 0, conventionally rep-
       resented in the C language as \0.  A character array is  a
       sequence of characters.  A null-terminated character array
       (a string) is a sequence of characters, the last of  which

       is  the  null  character.   The null string is a character
       array containing only the terminating null  character.   A
       NULL  pointer  is  the value that is obtained by casting 0
       into a pointer.  C guarantees that  this  value  will  not
       match  that  of  any legitimate pointer, so many functions
       that return pointers return NULL  to  indicate  an  error.
       The  macro  NULL is defined in stdio.h.  Types of the form
       size_t are defined in the appropriate header files.
