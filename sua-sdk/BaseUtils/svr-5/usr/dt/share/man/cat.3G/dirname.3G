       Given a pointer to a null-terminated character string that
       contains a  file  system  path  name,  dirname  returns  a
       pointer  to  a  static  constant string that is the parent
       directory of that  file.   In  doing  this,  it  sometimes
       places a null byte in the path name after the next to last
       element, so  the  content  of  path  must  be  disposable.
       Trailing  / characters in the path are not counted as part
       of the path.

       If path or *path does not contain /, a pointer to a static
       constant . is returned.

       dirname  and together yield a complete path name.  dirname
       (path) is the directory where basename (path) is found.

       The following code reads a path name, changes directory to
       the appropriate directory [see and opens the  file.   char
       path[100],  *pathcopy;  int  fd;  gets  (path); pathcopy =
       strdup (path); chdir (dirname  (pathcopy)  );  fd  =  open
       (basename (path), O_RDONLY);
