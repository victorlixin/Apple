       ldapdelete is a shell-accessible interface to the  library
       function.

       It  opens  a  connection  to  an  LDAP  server, binds, and
       deletes one or more entries. If one or more  dn  arguments
       are  provided,  entries with those Distinguished Names are
       deleted. Each dn should  be  a  string-represented  DN  as
       defined  in  RFC  1779. If no dn arguments are provided, a
       list of DNs is read from standard input (or from  file  if
       the -f option is used).

       Continuous   operation  mode.  Errors  are  reported,  but
       ldapdelete will continue with deletions. The default is to
       exit  after  reporting  an  error.  Set the LDAP debugging
       level to debuglevel.  See the loglevel option  in  Read  a
       series  of  Distinguished  Names (one per line) from file,
       deleting each entry in turn.   Specify  the  Distinguished
       Name to be used in binding to the directory.

       binddn  should  be  a string-represented DN, as defined in
       RFC 1779 or its successor.

       If a -D binddn option is not supplied,  the  command  will
       take the binddn value from the LDAP_BINDDN_CHANGE environ-
       ment variable, if set. If LDAP_BINDDN_CHANGE  specifies  a
       null  string,  it  is  assumed  that  an anonymous bind is
       required.

       If a -D option is not supplied, and LDAP_BINDDN_CHANGE  is
       not  used  to  specify the bind DN, the configuration file
       /etc/ldap/ldap_defaults will be  examined  for  a  default
       value  to  be used.  If no default is supplied, a value of
       "" will be assumed.  Use passwd as the password for simple
       authentication.  Read the password from the terminal. This
       is an alternative to  supplying  a  password  via  the  -w
       passwd option.

       The  password is prompted for in a non-echoing input mode.
       If ldapdelete has no controlling  terminal,  the  password
       will be read from standard input.  Specify the LDAP server
       to connect to.

       The server can be specified either as a hostname or  as  a
       dotted string giving an IP address.

       A  server port may be specified along with the server name
       or addresse by using the notation servername:portnumber or
       serverIPaddr:portnumber.   If   a   port   number  is  not

                                                                1

       explicitly specified for the particular server, a  default
       port (as described for the -p option) is used.

       If  a  null string is supplied, the local host is assumed.
       See the -p option for how the local port is selected.

       If no -h option is supplied, the  command  will  take  the
       ldaphost  value  from the LDAP_HOST  environment variable,
       if this is present.

       If no -h option is supplied, and  LDAP_HOST  is  not  set,
       then  the  configuration file /etc/ldap/ldap_defaults will
       be examined for a default value to be used.

       If no default is supplied, a value  of  "",  implying  the
       local  host, will be assumed.  Specify the TCP port number
       to connect to (using the notation  server:portnumber),  if
       not specified via the -h option.

       If no port number is explicitly supplied, the default LDAP
       port, 389, is assumed.

       Exit status is 0 if no errors occur. Errors  result  in  a
       non-zero  exit status and a diagnostic message being writ-
       ten to standard error.

       The following command attempts to delete the  entry  named
       with  commonName  ``Delete Me'' directly below the Univer-
       sity  of   Michigan   organizational   entry:   ldapdelete
       "cn=Delete  Me, o=University of Michigan, c=US" It is usu-
       ally necessary to supply a binddn and passwd for  deletion
       to be allowed (see the -D and -w or -W options).
