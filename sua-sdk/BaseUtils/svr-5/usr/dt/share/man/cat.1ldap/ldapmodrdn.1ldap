       ldapmodrdn  is a shell-accessible interface to the library
       function.

       It opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and  modi-
       fies  the  RDN  of  entries. The entry information is read
       from standard input, from file through the use of  the  -f
       option, or from the command-line pair dn and rdn.

   OOppttiioonnss
       Remove  old RDN values from the entry.  Default is to keep
       old values.  Show what would be done, but  don't  actually
       change  entries.  Useful for debugging in conjunction with
       -v.  Use verbose mode, with many  diagnostics  written  to
       standard  output.   Continuous  operation mode. Errors are
       reported, but ldapmodify will continue with modifications.
       The  default is to exit after reporting an error.  Set the
       LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  Specify  the  Distin-
       guished Name to be used in binding to the directory.

       binddn  should  be  a string-represented DN, as defined in
       RFC 1779 or its successor.

       If a -D binddn option is not supplied,  the  command  will
       take the binddn value from the LDAP_BINDDN_CHANGE environ-
       ment variable, if set. If LDAP_BINDDN_CHANGE  specifies  a
       null  string,  it  is  assumed  that  an anonymous bind is
       required.

       If a -D option is not supplied, and LDAP_BINDDN_CHANGE  is
       not  used  to  specify the bind DN, the configuration file
       /etc/ldap_defaults will be examined for a default value to
       be used.  If no default is supplied, a value of "" will be
       assumed.  Use passwd as the password for simple  authenti-
       cation.   Read  the password from the terminal. This is an
       alternative to supplying a  password  via  the  -w  passwd
       option.

       The  password is prompted for in a non-echoing input mode.
       If ldapmodrdn has no controlling terminal, then the  pass-
       word  will  be read from standard input.  Specify the LDAP
       servers to connect to.

       More than one server can be specified, in which  case  the
       servers  are  tried  in the order specified, stopping with
       the first one to which a successful connection is made.

       The servers can be specified either  as  hostnames  or  as
       dotted strings giving IP addresses.

                                                                1

       A server port may be specified along with the server names
       or addresses by using the  notation  servername:portnumber
       or  serverIPaddr:portnumber.  If  a  port  number  is  not
       explicitly specified for the particular server, a  default
       port (as described for the -p option) is used.

       If  a  null string is supplied, the local host is assumed.
       See the -p option for how the local port is selected.

       If no -h option is supplied, the  command  will  take  the
       ldaphost  value  from the LDAP_HOST  environment variable,
       if this is present.

       If no -h option is supplied, and  LDAP_HOST  is  not  set,
       then  the  configuration  file  /etc/ldap_defaults will be
       examined for a default value to be used.

       If no default is supplied, a value  of  "",  implying  the
       local  host, will be assumed.  Specify the TCP port number
       to connect to (using the notation  server:portnumber),  if
       not specified via the -h option.

       If no port number is explicitly supplied, the default LDAP
       port is assumed.  Read the entry modification  information
       from  file  instead of from standard input or the command-
       line.

       If the command-line arguments dn and rdn  are  given,  rdn
       will replace the RDN of the entry specified by the DN, dn.

       Otherwise, the contents of file (or standard input  if  no
       -f option is given) should consist of one or more entries.
       Distinguished Name (DN) Relative Distinguished Name  (RDN)
       One  or  more  blank  lines  may  be used to separate each
       DN/RDN pair.

       Exit status is 0 if no errors occur.  Errors result  in  a
       non-zero  exit status and a diagnostic message being writ-
       ten to standard error.

       Assume the file /tmp/entrymods has the following contents:
       cn=Modify Me, o=University of Michigan, c=US cn=The New Me
       In that case, the following command will change the RDN of
       the  ``Modify  Me''  entry from ``Modify Me'' to ``The New
       Me'' and the old cn, ``Modify Me'' will be removed:  ldap-
       modify -r -f /tmp/entrymods
