       uname stores information identifying the current

       system in the structure pointed to by name.

       uname  uses the structure utsname defined in sys/utsname.h
       whose  members  are:  char sysname[SYS_NMLN];   char node-
       name[SYS_NMLN];      char release[SYS_NMLN];     char ver-
       sion[SYS_NMLN]; char machine[SYS_NMLN];

       uname returns a null-terminated  character  string  naming
       the current

       system  in  the character array sysname.  Similarly, node-
       name contains the name that the system is known  by  on  a
       communications network.  release and version further iden-
       tify the operating system.  machine  contains  a  standard
       name that identifies the hardware that the

       system is running on.
