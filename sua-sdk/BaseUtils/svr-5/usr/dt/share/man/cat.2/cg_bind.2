       cg_bind  directs the system in the placement of a process,
       of subsequently executed  process  images  or  of  process
       children.

       The  combination of idtype and id specifies the process or
       LWP of interest.  When idtype is P_PID, id is  interpreted
       as  a  process id; the special value P_MYID may be used as
       shorthand for the calling process. When idtype is P_LWPID,
       id is interpreted as the LWP id of an LWP within the call-
       ing process; the special  value  P_MYID  may  be  used  as
       shorthand  for the calling LWP. In either case, an attempt
       to bind a  multi-threaded  process  will  be  rejected  (a
       restriction that may be relaxed in a future release).

       The  cgid  parameter  is  the target CPU-Group; additional
       values are reserved to mean: query without  altering  bind
       to  the  CPU-Group  to  which the target process currently
       belongs unbind  restore  default  binding  behavior  (with
       CGBIND_FORK only) The flags parameter may have the follow-
       ing values: bind the target now bind processes  forked  by
       the  target  a reserved value with currently unimplemented
       functionality The pointers ocgid and oflags, if not  NULL,
       are used to pass back the values that were in effect prior
       to the call.

       On  success,  cg_bind  returns  0.   On  failure,  cg_bind
       returns  -1  and  sets  errno to indicate the error: For a
       CGBIND_NOW operation, the target  CPU-Group  is  currently
       offline.   ocgid  or  oflags  points outside the allocated
       address space of  the  calling  process.   idtype  has  an
       invalid  value.  cgid does not refer to a valid CPU-Group.
       flags has an  invalid  value.   A  binding  operation  was
       attempted  on  a  multi-threaded process.  The caller does
       not have appropriate privileges for this call. The real or
       effective  user  ID  of the calling process must match the
       real or saved (from exec) user ID of the  target  process,
       unless  the  caller has the P_OWNER privilege.  No process
       can be found corresponding to that specified by  id.   The
       cg_bind call is not supported by the system.
