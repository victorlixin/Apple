       gettimeofday  gets  and  settimeofday  sets  the  system's
       notion of the current time.  The current time is expressed
       in  elapsed seconds and microseconds since 00:00 Universal
       Coordinated Time, January 1, 1970.  The resolution of  the
       system  clock  is  hardware  dependent;  the  time  may be
       updated continuously or in clock ticks.

       tp points to a timeval structure, which includes the  fol-
       lowing  members:  long    tv_sec;    /* seconds since Jan.
       1, 1970 */ long    tv_usec;   /* and microseconds */

       If tp is a null pointer, the current time  information  is
       not returned or set.

       The  second  argument to these functions, reserved, should
       be NULL.

       The TZ environment variable holds time  zone  information.
       See timezone.

       The  calling  process  must have the P_SYSOPS privilege to
       set the time of day.

       A -1 return value indicates that  an  error  occurred  and
       errno has been set.

   EErrrroorrss
       The following error codes may be set in errno:

       tp  specifies an invalid time.  An attempt was made to set
       the time of day and the caller did not have  the  P_SYSOPS
       privilege.

       The  implementation  of  settimeofday  ignores the tv_usec
       field of tp.  If the time needs to be set with better than
       one second accuracy, call settimeofday for the seconds and
       then adjtime for finer accuracy.
