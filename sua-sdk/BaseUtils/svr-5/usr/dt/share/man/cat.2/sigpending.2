       The  sigpending function retrieves those signals that have
       been sent to the calling process  but  are  being  blocked
       from  delivery  by the calling process's signal mask.  The
       signals are stored in the space pointed to by the argument
       set.

       On  success, sigpending returns 0.  On failure, sigpending
       returns -1 and sets errno to identify the error.

       In the following conditions,  sigpending  fails  and  sets
       errno  to:  The  set argument points outside the process's
       allocated address space.

       The set returned is the union of Signals  pending  to  the
       calling  thread  but blocked by that thread's signal mask.
       Signals pending to the process but blocked by  every  cur-
       rently running thread in the process.

       In  general,  the status from sigpending is only advisory.
       A signal pending to the containing process might be deliv-
       ered  to  a  sibling thread (if any become eligible) after
       the return of this system call.  See for further  details.

       In terms of LWPs, the set returned is the union of Signals
       pending to the calling LWP but blocked by that LWP's  sig-
       nal  mask.   Signals pending to the process but blocked by
       every LWP contained in the process.
