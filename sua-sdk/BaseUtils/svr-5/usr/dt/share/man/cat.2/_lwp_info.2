       _lwp_info fills the lwpinfo structure pointed to by buffer
       with time-accounting information for a single  lightweight
       process  (LWP).   The  lwpinfo  structure  in  <sys/lwp.h>
       includes the following members: timestruc_t lwp_utime;
       timestruc_t lwp_stime;

       lwp_utime is the CPU time used  while  executing  instruc-
       tions in the user space of the calling LWP.

       lwp_stime  is the CPU time used by the system on behalf of
       the calling LWP.

       _lwp_info returns 0 on success, and fills in  the  lwpinfo
       structure pointed to by buffer.

   EErrrroorrss
       If  the following condition is detected, _lwp_info returns
       the corresponding  value:  buffer  points  to  an  illegal
       address.

       This  call  may  be extended in the future to return other
       information in the lwpinfo structure as needed.

       Lightweight processes (LWPs) are internal  interfaces  and
       are subject to change.  Their use should be avoided.
