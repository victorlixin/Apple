       The  functions  fpathconf  and pathconf return the current
       value of a configurable limit or option associated with  a
       file  or directory.  The path argument points to the path-
       name of a file  or  directory;  fildes  is  an  open  file
       descriptor;  and  name is the symbolic constant defined in
       unistd.h [see representing the configurable  system  limit
       or option to be returned.

       The value of the configurable system limit or option spec-
       ified by name does not change during the lifetime  of  the
       calling process.

       The  values  returned  by pathconf and fpathconf depend on
       the type of file specified by path or fildes.  The follow-
       ing  table  contains  the  symbolic constants supported by
       pathconf and fpathconf along with the POSIX defined return
       value.   The  return  value  is  based on the type of file
       specified by path or fildes.

       Notes: If path or fildes refers to a directory, the  value
       returned applies to the directory itself.  The behavior is

                                                                1

fpathconf(2)                                         fpathconf(2)

       undefined if path or fildes does not refer to  a  terminal
       file.   If path or fildes refers to a directory, the value
       returned applies to the filenames  within  the  directory.
       The behavior is undefined if path or fildes does not refer
       to a directory.  If path or fildes refers to a  directory,
       the  value  returned  is  the maximum length of a relative
       pathname when  the  specified  directory  is  the  current
       directory.   If  path  or fildes refers to a pipe or FIFO,
       the value returned applies to the FIFO itself.  If path or
       fildes  refers  to a directory, the value returned applies
       to any FIFOs that exist  or  can  be  created  within  the
       directory.   If  path or fildes refer to any other type of
       file, the behavior is undefined.  If path or fildes refers
       to  a  directory, the value returned applies to any files,
       other than directories,  that  exist  or  can  be  created
       within the directory.

       If  fpathconf or pathconf are invoked with a symbolic con-
       stant that corresponds to a configurable system  limit  or
       option  without  a  fixed  upper  bound,  a value of -1 is
       returned and the value of errno is not changed.

   EErrrroorrss
       The fpathconf call fails and sets errno as shown  if:  The
       value  of  name  is  not  valid, or the association of the
       variable name with the specified file  is  not  supported.
       The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       The pathconf call fails and sets errno as shown if: Search
       permission is denied for a component of the  path  prefix;
       or,  read  permission  is  denied  on the named file.  The
       value of name is not valid,  or  the  association  of  the
       variable  name  with  the specified file is not supported.
       Too many symbolic links are encountered while  translating
       path.   Components  of  path  require  hopping to multiple
       remote machines and file system type does  not  allow  it.
       The  length  of  a  pathname exceeds PATH_MAX, or pathname
       component is longer than NAME_MAX while _POSIX_NO_TRUNC is
       in effect; or, pathname resolution of a symbolic link pro-
       duced  an  intermediate  result   whose   length   exceeds
       PATH_MAX.   A  component of path does not name an existing
       file or path is an empty string.  path points to a  remote
       machine  and the link to that machine is no longer active.
       A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
