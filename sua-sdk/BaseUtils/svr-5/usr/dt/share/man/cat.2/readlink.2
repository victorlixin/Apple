       readlink places the contents of the symbolic link referred
       to by path in the buffer buf, which has size bufsiz.   The
       contents   of   the  link  are  not  null-terminated  when
       returned.

       On success, readlink  returns  the  number  of  characters
       placed  in  the  buffer.  On failure, readlink returns -1,
       sets errno to identify the error, and the  buffer  remains
       unchanged.

       In the following conditions, readlink fails and sets errno
       to: Search permission is denied for  a  component  of  the
       path  prefix  of  path.   Read permission is denied on the
       file named by path.  path or buf extends outside the allo-
       cated address space of the process.  The named file is not
       a symbolic link.  An I/O error occurs while  reading  from
       or  writing  to  the file system.  Too many symbolic links
       are encountered in translating path.  The  length  of  the
       path  argument exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or the length of a path
       component exceeds {NAME_MAX} while _POSIX_NO_TRUNC  is  in
       effect.   The  named file does not exist.  The file system
       does not support symbolic links.
