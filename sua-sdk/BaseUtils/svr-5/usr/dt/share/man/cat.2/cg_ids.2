       cg_ids  obtains a list of the CPU-Groups within the system
       and stores the result in the array of CPU-Group IDs speci-
       fied  by  cgid_array. This array has the number of entries
       in ncgids and must be large enough to contain  the  entire
       list.

       The selector parameter takes the value CG_ONLINE.

       On  success,  cg_ids   returns  the  number  of CPU-Groups
       within the system. On failure, cg_ids returns a  value  of
       -1 and sets errno to indicate the error: the selector con-
       tains an invalid value.  the value of ncgids is less  than
       the  number  of  appropriate  CPU-Groups in the system.  a
       referenced part of the array pointed to by  cgid_array  is
       outside  of  the  allocated  address space of the process.
       the cg_ids call is not supported by the system.
