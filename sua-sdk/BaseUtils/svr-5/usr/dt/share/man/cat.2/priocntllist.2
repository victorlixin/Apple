       priocntllist supports the same capabilities  as  priocntl,
       but  provides an interface for specifying an arbitrary set
       of LWPs within the calling process  to  which  the  system
       call applies.

       specifies the function to be performed.  is a pointer to a
       structure whose type depends on cmd.  See  for  the  valid
       values  of cmd and the corresponding arg structures.  is a
       pointer to an array in user memory of LWP IDs  that  iden-
       tify  the  LWPs  to which the system call applies.  is the
       number of elements in the array.  If one or  more  of  the
       LWPs  specified by the lwpid array do not exist, priocntl-
       list performs the operation on all LWPs specified  in  the
       lwpid  array  that do exist, and then returns failure with
       errno set to ESRCH.
