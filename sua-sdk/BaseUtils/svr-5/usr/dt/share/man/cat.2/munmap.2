       int munmap(void *addr, size_t len);

       The  function munmap removes the mappings for pages in the
       range (addr, addr + len).   Further  references  to  these
       pages  will  result in the delivery of a SIGSEGV signal to
       the process.

       The function mmap often performs an implicit munmap.

       On success, munmap returns 0.  On failure, munmap  returns
       -1 and sets errno to identify the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In  the  following conditions, munmap fails and sets errno
       to: addr is not a multiple of the page size as returned by
       sysconf.   Addresses  in  the range (addr, addr + len) are
       outside the valid range for the address space  of  a  pro-
       cess.   The argument len has a value less than or equal to
       0.

       Sibling threads share (by  definition)  the  same  address
       space;  modifications  to  the address space by one can be
       perceived by the others.
