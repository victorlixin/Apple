       void sync(void);

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       sync  causes  all  information in memory that should be on
       disk to be written  out.   This  includes  modified  super
       blocks, modified i-nodes, and delayed block I/O.

       The  writing,  although scheduled, is not necessarily com-
       pleted before sync returns.  The fsync  system  call  com-
       pletes the writing before it returns.

UUssaaggee
       sync  should  be used by programs that examine a file sys-
       tem, such as and so on.  It is mandatory before a re-boot.
