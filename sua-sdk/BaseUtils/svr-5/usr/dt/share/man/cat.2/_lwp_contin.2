       _lwp_continue  removes the execution prohibition from tar-
       get_LWP, permitting execution to continue if possible.

       _lwp_continue returns zero for success, and an error  num-
       ber for failure, as described below.

       If  any of the following conditions is detected, _lwp_con-
       tinue returns the corresponding value: No LWP can be found
       in the current process with identity target_LWP.

       Lightweight  processes  (LWPs) are internal interfaces and
       are subject to change.  Their use should be avoided.
