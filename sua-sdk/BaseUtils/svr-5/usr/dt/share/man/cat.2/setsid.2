       If  the  calling  process  is  not already a process group
       leader, setsid sets the process group ID and session ID of
       the  calling process to the process ID of the calling pro-
       cess, and releases the process's controlling terminal.

       On success, setsid returns the calling  process's  session
       ID.  On failure, setsid returns -1 and sets errno to iden-
       tify the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the following conditions, setsid fails and  sets  errno
       to: The calling process is already a process group leader,
       or there are processes  other  than  the  calling  process
       whose  process  group ID is equal to the process ID of the
       calling process.

       If the calling process is the last member  of  a  pipeline
       started  by  a  job  control shell, the shell may make the
       calling process a process group leader.   The  other  pro-
       cesses  of  the  pipeline  become  members of that process
       group.  In this case, the call to setsid will  fail.   For
       this reason, a process that calls setsid and expects to be
       part of a pipeline should always first  fork;  the  parent
       should  exit  and  the  child  should call setsid, thereby
       insuring that the process will work reliably when  started
       by both job control shells and non-job control shells.

       This  ID  number is an attribute of the containing process
       and is shared by sibling threads.
