       _lwp_kill sends a signal sig to a sibling lightweight pro-
       cess (LWP) lwpid.  _lwp_kill is the LWP analog of kill.

       _lwp_kill functions irrespective of whether the LWP  iden-
       tified  by  lwpid  was  created with the LWP_DETACHED flag
       set.

       Job control signals sent to  individual  LWPs  affect  the
       process as a whole.

       Uncatchable signals cannot be sent to the init process.

       _lwp_kill  can succeed (in posting the signal) even if the
       target lwpid has been suspended by _lwp_suspend.

       lwpid is the LWP ID of the sibling LWP which is to receive
       the  signal.  The scope of lwpid is the process with which
       the sender is associated; signals cannot be sent to a non-
       sibling  LWP, that is, signals cannot be sent to an LWP in
       another process using _lwp_kill.

       sig is the signal number of the signal to be sent, and  is
       either  0 or a value from the list given in signal(5).  If
       sig is 0 (the null signal), error  checking  is  performed
       but  no signal is actually sent; this can be used to check
       the validity of lwpid.

       _lwp_kill returns zero for success and an error number for
       failure, as described below.

       If  any of the following conditions is detected, _lwp_kill
       returns the corresponding value: The sig argument contains
       an invalid or unsupported signal number.

       EPERM  The sig argument is SIGKILL or SIGSTOP and the tar-
              get LWP is in process 1  (init).   No  LWP  can  be
              found in the current process with identity lwpid.

       Lightweight  processes  (LWPs) are internal interfaces and
       are subject to change.  Their use should be avoided.
