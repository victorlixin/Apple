       cg_current  returns the identity of the CPU-Group to which
       the specified process or LWP belongs.

       The combination of idtype and id specifies the process  or
       LWP  of interest.  When idtype is P_PID, id is interpreted
       as a process id; the special value P_MYID may be  used  as
       shorthand for the calling process. When idtype is P_LWPID,
       id is interpreted as the LWP id of an LWP within the call-
       ing  process;  the  special  value  P_MYID  may be used as
       shorthand for the calling LWP.

       On success, cg_current returns a CPU-Group identifier.  On
       failure,  cg_current  returns (cgid_t)-1 and sets errno to
       indicate the error:  idtype  has  an  invalid  value.   An
       invalid process or LWP id was supplied.  No process can be
       found corresponding to that specified by id.  The  cg_cur-
       rent call is not supported by the system.
