       getpid returns the process ID of the calling process.

       getpgrp  returns  the process group ID of the calling pro-
       cess.

       getppid returns the parent process ID of the calling  pro-
       cess.

       getpgid  returns the process group ID of the process whose
       process ID is equal to pid, or the process group ID of the
       calling process, if pid is equal to zero.

       On  success, getpgid returns a process group ID.  On fail-
       ure, getpgid returns (pid_t) -1 and sets errno to identify
       the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In  the following conditions, getpgid fails and sets errno
       to: The process whose process ID is equal to pid is not in
       the same session as the calling process, and the implemen-
       tation does not allow access to the process  group  ID  of
       that  process  from the calling process.  There is no pro-
       cess with a process ID equal to pid.

       These ID numbers are attributes of the containing  process
       and are shared by sibling threads.
