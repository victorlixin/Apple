       processor_info obtains information about a single  proces-
       sor  in  the  system.   The information is returned in the
       processor_info_t structure  pointed  to  by  infop.   This
       structure  contains  the following fields: Either P_ONLINE
       or P_OFFLINE.  If the  processor  is  offline,  the  other
       fields  are  meaningless.   A null terminated ASCII string
       specifying the type of processor; one of  i386,  i486,  or
       i860.   A null terminated ASCII string specifying the type
       of floating point hardware available.  The string consists
       of  zero  or more floating point identifier strings, sepa-
       rated by commas.  Each of the  floating  point  identifier
       strings  may  be  one  of  i387,  or  w1167.   In previous
       releases, this field contained the frequency of  the  pro-
       cessor clock, in megahertz.  This field is no longer mean-
       ingful and is provided only for compatibility.  Its  value
       is always 16.

       On success, processor_info returns 0.  On failure, proces-
       sor_info returns -1 and sets errno to identify the  error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the following conditions, processor_info fails and sets
       errno to: The infop pointer points to  an  invalid  memory
       address.   The  processorid  does not refer to an existing
       processor.  The processor to which processorid  refers  is
       not operational.
