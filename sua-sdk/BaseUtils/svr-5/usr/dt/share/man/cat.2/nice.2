       nice  allows a member of the time-sharing scheduling class
       to change its priority.

       nice adds the value of incr to the nice value of the call-
       ing  process.  The nice value is a non-negative number for
       which a more positive value results in lower CPU priority.

       A  maximum  nice value of 39 and a minimum nice value of 0
       are imposed by the system.  (The  default  nice  value  is
       20.)   Requests  for  values  above  or below these limits
       result in the nice value being set  to  the  corresponding
       limit,  unless  the calling process has the P_TSHAR privi-
       lege.

       On success, nice returns the new nice value minus 20.   On
       failure,  nice  returns  -1 and sets errno to identify the
       error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the following conditions, nice fails and sets errno to:
       incr  is  negative or greater than 39 and the calling pro-
       cess does not have the P_TSHAR privilege.  The process was
       in a scheduling class other than time-sharing.

       is a more general interface to scheduler functions.

       The nice system call should not be used to modify the pri-
       ority of threads.  See

       Scheduling context is not a process attribute, a  separate
       context  is internally maintained for each LWP.  A call to
       nice shall bias only the priority of the  calling  LWP  by
       the applied nice value.

       A process can contain LWPs belonging to different schedul-
       ing classes.
