       cg_info  obtains  information  about a single CPU-Group in
       the system. The cgid parameter specifies the CPU-Group for
       which  information  is  to  be returned; the special value
       CG_CURRENT may be used as shorthand for the caller's  cur-
       rent CPU-Group.

       The  information  is  returned  in  the cginfo_t structure
       pointed to by infop. This structure contains the following
       fields:  Either  CG_ONLINE or CG_OFFLINE. If the CPU-Group
       is offline, the other fields  are  meaningless.   Size  of
       near memory in bytes.

       Note that on some machines it may be possible for physical
       memory sizes to be larger than the natural data  sizes  of
       the processor. A memsize_t on such a machine may be a long
       long quantity.  Size of any far memory cache on  the  CPU-
       Group. Some machines will have hardware that is capable of
       cacheing the contents of far memory.  A large  far  memory
       cache  can  partially  hide the costs of using far memory.
       The number of CPUs configured (the  total  of  online  and
       offline  CPUs  for the CPU-Group). Note that not all hard-
       ware configurations will have equal  numbers  of  CPUs  on
       each  CPU-Group.  Number of CPUs online for the CPU-Group.

       On  success,  cg_info  returns  0.   On  failure,  cg_info
       returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error: the infop
       pointer points to an invalid memory  address.   cgid  does
       not  refer  to an existing CPU-Group.  the cg_info call is
       not supported by the system.
