       chdir  and  fchdir cause a directory pointed to by path or
       fildes to become the current working directory, the start-
       ing  point  for  path searches for pathnames not beginning
       with /.  path points to the pathname of a directory.   The
       fildes  argument to fchdir is an open file descriptor of a
       directory.

       In order for a directory to become the current  directory,
       a  process must have execute (search) access to the direc-
       tory, or have the P_DACREAD privilege.

       On success, chdir returns 0.  On  failure,  chdir  returns
       -1,  sets  errno  to  identify  the error, and the current
       directory remains unchanged.

       In the following conditions, chdir fails  and  sets  errno
       to:  Search  permission is denied for any component of the
       pathname.  path points outside the allocated address space
       of  the process.  A signal was caught during the execution
       of the chdir system call.  An  I/O  error  occurred  while
       reading from or writing to the file system.  Too many sym-
       bolic links were encountered  in  translating  path.   The
       length  of  the  path  argument exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or the
       length  of  a  path  component  exceeds  {NAME_MAX}  while
       _POSIX_NO_TRUNC is in effect.  A component of the pathname
       is not a directory.  Either a component of the path prefix
       or the directory named by path does not exist or is a null
       pathname.  path points to a remote machine and the link to
       that  machine  is  no  longer  active.  Components of path
       require hopping to multiple remote machines and file  sys-
       tem type does not allow it.

       In  the  following conditions, fchdir fails and sets errno
       to: Search permission is denied for fildes.  fildes is not
       an  open  file descriptor.  A signal was caught during the
       execution  of  the  fchdir  system  call.   An  I/O  error
       occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
       fildes points to a remote machine and  the  link  to  that
       machine  is  no  longer  active.  The open file descriptor
       fildes does not  refer  to  a  directory.   The  directory
       pointed to by fildes does not exist.

       Both  current working directory and current root directory
       are process attributes  and  are  shared  by  all  related
       threads.   A  change  by  one thread will be shared by all
       siblings.
