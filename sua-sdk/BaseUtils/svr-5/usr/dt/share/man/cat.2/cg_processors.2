       cg_processors  obtains  a  list of the processors within a
       CPU-Group and stores the result in the array of  processor
       IDs  specified  by processorid_array. This array has npro-
       cessorids entries and must be large enough to contain  the
       entire list.

       The  cgid  parameter specifies the CPU-Group for which the
       contained processor identifiers are to be  returned.   The
       special  value CG_CURRENT may be used as shorthand for the
       caller's current CPU-Group.

       The selector parameter takes the value P_ONLINE.

       If the CPU-Group is not online, cg_processors  fails  with
       EAGAIN.

       On  success,  cg_processors returns the number of selected
       processors within the CPU-Group. On failure, cg_processors
       returns  a  value  of  -1  and  sets errno to indicate the
       error: The CPU-Group was not online selector  contains  an
       invalid  value cgid contains an invalid value The value of
       nprocessorids is less than the number of specified proces-
       sors  in  the  CPU-Group.   A referenced part of the array
       pointed to by processorid_array is outside  of  the  allo-
       cated  address  space  of  the process.  The cg_processors
       call is not supported by the system.
