       int setpgid(pid_t pid, pid_t pgid);

       setpgid  sets  the process group ID of the process with ID
       pid to pgid.  If  pgid  is  equal  to  pid,   the  process
       becomes  a  process group leader.  If pgid is not equal to
       pid, the process becomes a member of an  existing  process
       group.

       If  pid  is equal to 0, the process ID of the calling pro-
       cess is used.  If pgid is equal to 0, the  process  speci-
       fied by pid becomes a process group leader.

       On  success,  setpgid  returns  0.   On  failure,  setpgid
       returns -1 and sets errno to identify the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       In the following conditions, setpgid fails and sets  errno
       to:  pid  matches the process ID of a child process of the
       calling process and the  child  process  has  successfully
       executed  an  function.   pgid  is associated with another
       process group.  pgid is less than (pid_t)  0,  or  greater
       than  or  equal  to  {PID_MAX}.  The calling process has a
       controlling terminal that does not  support  job  control.
       The  process  indicated  by  the pid argument is a session
       leader.  pid matches the process ID of a child process  of
       the  calling  process  and the child process is not in the
       same session as the calling process.  pgid does not  match
       the  process  ID of the process indicated by the pid argu-
       ment and there is no process with a process group ID  that
       matches  pgid  in the same session as the calling process.
       pid does not match the process ID of the  calling  process
       or of a child process of the calling process.

       This  ID  number is an attribute of the containing process
       and is shared by sibling threads.
