       The  reinit  command  is  used  to  change  the  values of
       descriptors defined in the initialization  file  that  was
       named  when  fmli  was  invoked  and/or  define additional
       descriptors.  FMLI will parse and evaluate the descriptors
       in  file,  and  then continue running the current applica-
       tion.  The argument file must be the name of a valid  FMLI
       initialization file.

       The  reinit  command  does not re-display the introductory
       frame or change the layout of screen labels  for  function
       keys.
