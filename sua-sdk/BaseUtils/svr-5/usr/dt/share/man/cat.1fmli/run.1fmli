       The  run function runs program, using the PATH variable to
       find it.  By default, when program has completed, the user
       is  prompted  (Press  ENTER  to  continue:),  before being
       returned to FMLI.  The argument program is a  system  exe-
       cutable followed by its options (if any).  If -e is speci-
       fied the user will be prompted before  returning  to  FMLI
       only if there is an error condition If -n is specified the
       user will never be prompted before returning to FMLI (use-
       ful  for  programs like vi, in which the user must do some
       specific action to exit  in  the  first  place).   The  -s
       option means ``silent,'' implying that the screen will not
       have to be repainted when program  has  completed.   NOTE:
       The  -s  option  should only be used when program does not
       write to the terminal.  In addition, when -s is used, pro-
       gram  cannot  be interrupted, even if it recognizes inter-
       rupts.
