       The set command sets variable in the environment, or  adds
       variable=value  to file.  If variable is not equated it to
       a value, set expects the value to be  on  standard  input.
       The  unset  command  removes variable.  Note that the FMLI
       predefined, read-only variables (such as ARG1), may not be
       set or unset.

       FMLI  inherits  the   environment  when  invoked:  sets or
       unsets the specified variable in  the  local  environment.
       Variables  set  with -l will not be inherited by processes
       invoked from FMLI.  sets the  specified  variable  in  the
       environment.   Variables  set with -e will be inherited by
       any processes started from FMLI.  Note  that  these  vari-
       ables cannot be unset.  sets or unsets the specified vari-
       able in the global environment.  The argument file is  the
       name,  or pathname, of a file containing lines of the form
       variable=value.  file will  be  created  if  it  does  not
       already  exist.   Note that no space intervenes between -f
       and file.

       Note that at least one of the above options must  be  used
       for  each variable being set or unset.  If you set a vari-
       able with  the  -ffilename  option,  you  must  thereafter
       include  filename  in  references  to  that variable.  For
       example, ${(file)VARIABLE}.

       Variables  set  to be available to the  environment (those
       set using the -e option) can only be set for  the  current
       fmli process and the processes it calls.

       When  using  the  -f  option, unless file is unique to the
       process, other users of FMLI on the same machine  will  be
       able   to   expand   these  variables,  depending  on  the
       read/write permissions on file.

       A variable set in one frame may be referenced or unset  in
       any other frame.  This includes local variables.

       When  a  variable  is evaluated that does not specifically
       reference a file, the local environment and  system  envi-
       ronment  are searched in that order.  (When a set -l and a
       set -e  is  done  for  the  same  variable,  the  variable

                                                                1

       evaluates to the value used in the set -l command.)
