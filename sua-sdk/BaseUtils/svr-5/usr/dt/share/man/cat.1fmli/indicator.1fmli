       The  indicator  function  displays  application   specific
       alarms  or the ``Working'' indicator, or both, on the FMLI
       banner line.  The argument string is a string to  be  dis-
       played  on  the banner line, and should always be the last
       argument given.  Note that  string  is  not  automatically
       cleared from the banner line.

       The  following  options are available: The -b option rings
       the terminal bell n times, where n is an integer from 1 to
       10.  The default value is 1.  If the terminal has no bell,
       the screen is flashed instead, if possible.  The -c option
       defines  the  column  of the banner line at which to start
       the indicator string.  The  argument  column  must  be  an
       integer  from  0  to  DISPLAYW-1.  If the -c option is not
       used, column defaults to 0.  The  -l  option  defines  the
       maximum  length  of  the  string  displayed.  If string is
       longer than length characters, it will be truncated.   The
       argument length must be an integer from 1 to DISPLAYW.  If
       the -l option is not used, length  defaults  to  DISPLAYW.
       NOTE:  if string doesn't fit it will be truncated.  The -o
       option causes indicator to duplicate its output to stdout.
       The -w option turns on the working indicator.

       When  the  value  entered  in a form field is invalid, the
       following use of indicator will ring the bell three  times
       and  display  the  word  WRONG starting at column 1 of the
       banner line.  invalidmsg=`indicator -b 3 -c 1 "WRONG"`

       To clear the indicator after telling the user the entry is
       wrong:  invalidmsg=`indicator -b 9 -c 1 "WRONG"; sleep(3);
            indicator -c 1 "     "`

       In this example the value of invalidmsg (in this case  the
       default  value  Input  is not valid), still appears on the
       FMLI message line.

                                                                1
