       fmlgrep  [options] limited_regular_expression [file . . .]

       fmlgrep searches file for a pattern and prints  all  lines
       that contain that pattern.  The fmlgrep function uses lim-
       ited regular expressions  (expressions  that  have  string
       values  that use a subset of the possible alphanumeric and
       special characters) like those used with to match the pat-
       terns.  It uses a compact non-deterministic algorithm.

       Be  careful  when using FMLI special characters (for exam-
       ple, $, `, ', ")  in  limited_regular_expression.   It  is
       safest to enclose the entire limited_regular_expression in
       single quotes ' . . . ' .

       If file is not specified, fmlgrep assumes standard  input.
       Normally,  each line matched is copied to standard output.
       The file name is printed before each line matched if there
       is more than one input file.

       Command line options are:

       Precede  each  line  by  the  block number on which it was
       found.  This can be useful in locating  block  numbers  by
       context  (first  block  is  0).  Print only a count of the
       lines that contain the pattern.  Ignore  upper/lower  case
       distinction  during  comparisons.  Print only the names of
       files with matching lines, separated by  new-lines.   Does
       not  repeat  the  names of files when the pattern is found
       more than once.  Precede each line by its line  number  in
       the file (first line is 1).  Suppress error messages about
       nonexistent or unreadable files.  Print all  lines  except
       those that contain the pattern.

       fmlgrep  returns the following exit values: if the pattern
       is found (that is, TRUE) if the pattern is not found (that
       is,  FALSE)  if  an invalid expression was used or file is
       inaccessible

       Lines are limited to BUFSIZ characters; longer  lines  are
       truncated.  BUFSIZ is defined in /usr/include/stdio.h.

       If  there is a line with embedded nulls, fmlgrep will only
       match up to the first null; if it matches, it  will  print
       the entire line.
