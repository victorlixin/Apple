       The vsig executable sends a SIGUSR2 signal to the control-
       ling FMLI process.  This signal/alarm causes FMLI to  exe-
       cute the FMLI built-in command checkworld which causes all
       posted objects with a reread descriptor evaluating to TRUE
       to be reread.  vsig takes no arguments (see

       The following is a segment of a shell program: echo "Send-
       ing this string to an FMLI process" vsig

       The vsig executable flushes the output  buffer  before  it
       sends  the SIGUSR2 signal to make sure the string is actu-
       ally in the pipe created by the cocreate function.

       Because vsig synchronizes with FMLI,  it  should  be  used
       rather than kill to send a SIGUSR2 signal to FMLI.
