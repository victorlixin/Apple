       The  pathconv  function converts an alias to its pathname.
       By default, it takes the alias as a string from stdin.  If
       -f  is  specified, the full path will be returned (this is
       the default).  If -t is specified, pathconv will  truncate
       a  pathname  specified  in string in a format suitable for
       display as a frame title.  This format is a shortened ver-
       sion  of the full pathname, created by deleting components
       of the path from the middle of  the  string  until  it  is
       under  DISPLAYW - 6 characters in length, and then insert-
       ing ellipses (...) between the remaining pieces.  Ellipses
       are  also  used  to  show  truncation  at  the ends of the
       strings if necessary, unless the -l option is  given.   If
       -l  is specified, < and > will be used instead of ellipses
       (...) to indicate truncation at the  ends  of  the  string
       generated  by  the -t option.  Truncation in the middle of
       the string is still indicated  with  ellipses.   Using  -l
       allows  display of the longest possible string while still
       notifying users it has been truncated.  If  -n  is  speci-
       fied,  num is the maximum length of the string (in charac-
       ters) generated by the -t option.  The argument num can be
       any integer from 1 to 255.  If the -v option is used, then
       alias or string can be specified when pathconv is  called.
       The  argument  alias  must  be  an  alias  defined  in the
       alias_file named when  fmli  was  invoked.   The  argument
       string  can  only be used with the -t option and must be a
       pathname.

       Here is a menu descriptor that uses pathconv to  construct
       the  menu title.  It searches for MYPATH in the alias_file
       named when fmli was invoked: menu=`pathconv -v MYPATH/ls`

       where there is a line in alias_file that  defines  MYPATH.
       For example, MYPATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/bin.

       Here  is  a  menu  descriptor that takes alias from stdin.
       menu=`echo MYPATH/ls | pathconv`
