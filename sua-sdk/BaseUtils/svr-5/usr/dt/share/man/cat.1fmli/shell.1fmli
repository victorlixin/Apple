       The  shell function concatenates its arguments, separating
       each by a space, and passes this  string  to  the   system
       shell ($SHELL if set, otherwise /usr/bin/sh).

       Since the Form and Menu Language does not directly support
       background processing, the  shell  function  can  be  used
       instead.  `shell "build prog > /dev/null &"`

       If  you  want  the user to continue to be able to interact
       with the application while the background job is  running,
       the output of an executable run by shell in the background
       must be redirected: to a file if you want to save the out-
       put,  or  to /dev/null if you don't want to save it (or if
       there is no output), otherwise your application may appear
       to be hung until the background job finishes processing.

       shell  can  also be used to execute a command that has the
       same name as an FMLI built-in function.

       The arguments to shell will be concatenated using  spaces,
       which  may  or may not do what is expected.  The variables
       set in local environments will  not  be  expanded  by  the
       shell  because ``local'' means ``local to the current pro-
       cess.''
