       The  readfile function reads file and copies it to stdout.
       No translation of NEWLINE is done.  It keeps track of  the
       longest line it reads and if there is a subsequent call to
       longline, the length of that line, including  the  NEWLINE
       character, is returned.

       The   readfile  function  primarily  checks  the  system's
       locale.  If it is not set to C (default), it tries to read
       file  from  dirname/$LANG.   If no file can be found under
       dirname/$LANG, file will be read from dirname.

       The longline function returns the  length,  including  the
       NEWLINE  character,  of the longest line in file.  If file
       is not specified, it uses the file named in the last  call
       to readfile.

       Here  is  a typical use of readfile and longline in a text
       frame definition file:
          .
          .
          .  text="`readfile myfile`" columns=`longline`
          .
          .
          .

       If file does not exist, readfile will return  FALSE  (that
       is, the expression will have an error return).

       longline  returns  0 if a readfile has not previously been
       issued.

       More than one descriptor can call  readfile  in  the  same
       frame  definition  file.   In text frames, if one of those
       calls is made from the text descriptor, then a  subsequent
       use  of  longline  will always get the longest line of the
       file  read  by  the  readfile  associated  with  the  text
       descriptor,  even  if  it  was  not the most recent use of
       readfile.
