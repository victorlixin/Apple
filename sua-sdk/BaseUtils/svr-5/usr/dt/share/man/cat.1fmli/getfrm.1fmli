       getfrm  returns  the  current frameID number.  The frameID
       number is a number assigned to the frame by FMLI and  dis-
       played flush left in the frame's title bar.  If a frame is
       closed its frameID number may be reused when a  new  frame
       is opened.  getfrm takes no arguments.

       If  a menu whose frameID is 3 defines an item to have this
       action descriptor: action=open text stdtext `getfrm`

       the text frame defined  in  the  definition  file  stdtext
       would be passed the argument 3 when it is opened.

       It  is  not  a  good  idea  to  use getfrm in a backquoted
       expression coded on a line by itself.   Stand-alone  back-
       quoted  expressions  are  evaluated before any descriptors
       are parsed, thus the frame is not yet fully  current,  and
       may not have been assigned a frameID number.
