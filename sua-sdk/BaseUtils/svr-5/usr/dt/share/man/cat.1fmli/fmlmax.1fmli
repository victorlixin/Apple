       The  fmlmax  command determines the position of a field on
       the screen after having  determined  the  longest  of  the
       fields specified by the arguments field1 to fieldn. Fields
       are input as strings between "".  Normally,  fmlmax  would
       be  used  when re-designing forms that have been described
       with the autolayout descriptor set to  TRUE.   The  fmlmax
       command can be alternatively used to determine the longest
       among a number of fields.

       The available options are as follows: If -c is  specified,
       the  column in which the fields start must be indicated in
       the variable column.  The fmlmax utility would then calcu-
       late  the  beginning  column on the basis of the following
       formula: column + length_of_longest_field + 1.  If  -l  is
       specified,  fmlmax  is  to  calculate  the  length  of the
       longest field among field1 to fieldn.

       To invoke fmlmax: fmlmax -c 4 "abc" "abcdefgh" "a"

       In this case fmlmax will return 13 as the beginning column
       of the input field after "abc", "abcdefgh" and "a".

       To invoke fmlmax with the -l option: fmlmax -l "abc"

       the return value of fmlmax will be 3.

       The -c and -l options cannot be used together.

       If  fmlmax  is  called without any option, the default for
       the beginning column of field1 to field will be 1.

       If fmlmax is used without arguments the  fmli  will  flash
       the following message: fmlmax: wrong number of arguments

       and  then  will  continue  with  the interpretation of the
       description file.
