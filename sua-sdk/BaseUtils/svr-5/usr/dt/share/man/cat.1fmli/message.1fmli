       The  message  command  puts string out on the FMLI message
       line.  If there is no string, the stdin input  to  message
       will  be  used.   The  output  of  message  has a duration
       (length of time it remains  on  the  message  line).   The
       default  duration is ``transient'': it or one of two other
       durations can be requested with  the  following  mutually-
       exclusive options:
       explicitly  defines  a message to have transient duration.
       Transient messages remain on the message line  only  until
       the  user presses another key or a CHECKWORLD occurs.  The
       descriptors itemmsg, fieldmsg, invalidmsg, choicemsg,  the
       default-if-not-defined value of oninterrupt, and FMLI gen-
       erated error messages (for example,  from  syntax  errors)
       also  output  transient duration messages.  Transient mes-
       sages take precedence over both frame messages and  perma-
       nent  messages.  defines a message to have ``frame'' dura-
       tion.  Frame messages remain on the message line  as  long
       as  the  frame  in which they are defined is current.  The
       descriptor framemsg also outputs a frame duration message.
       Frame  messages  take  precedence over permanent messages.
       defines a message to have ``permanent'' duration.   Perma-
       nent messages remain on the message line for the length of
       the FMLI session, unless explicitly  replaced  by  another
       permanent message or temporarily superseded by a transient
       message or frame message.   A  permanent  message  is  not
       affected by navigating away from, or by closing, the frame
       which generated the  permanent  message.   The  descriptor
       permanentmsg also outputs a permanent duration message.

       Messages  displayed  with  message -p will replace (change
       the value of) any message currently  displayed  or  stored
       via use of the permanentmsg descriptor.  Likewise, message
       -f will replace any message currently displayed or  stored
       via use of the framemsg descriptor.  If more than one mes-
       sage in a frame definition file is specified with  the  -p
       option, the last one specified will be the permanent dura-
       tion message.

       The string argument should always be  the  last  argument.
       Other  options  available  with message are the following:
       rings the terminal bell num times, where num is an integer
       from  1  to  10.  The default value is 1.  If the terminal
       has no bell, the screen will flash num times  instead,  if
       possible.
       forces  message to duplicate its message to stdout.  turns
       on the working indicator.

                                                                1

       When a value entered in a field is invalid, ring the  bell
       3 times and then display Invalid Entry: Try again!  on the
       message line: invalidmsg=`message -b 3 "Invalid Entry: Try
       again!"`

       Display  a message that tells the user what is being done:
       done=`message EDITOR has been  set  in  your  environment`
       close

       Display  a message on the message line and stdout for each
       field in  a  form  (a  pseudo-"field  duration"  message).
       fieldmsg="`message -o -f "Enter a filename."`"

       Display a blank transient message (effect is to ``remove''
       a permanent or  frame  duration  message).   done=`message
       ""` nop

       If  message  is  coded more than once on a single line, it
       may appear that only the  right-most  instance  is  inter-
       preted and displayed.  Use between uses of message in this
       case, to display multiple messages.

       message -f should not be used in a stand-alone  backquoted
       expression  or  with the init descriptor because the frame
       is not yet current when these are evaluated.

       In cases where `message -f "string"` is part of  a  stand-
       alone backquoted expression, the context for evaluation of
       the expression is the previously current frame.  The  pre-
       viously  current  frame  can  be the frame that issued the
       open command  for  the  frame  containing  the  backquoted
       expression, or it can be a frame given as an argument when
       fmli was invoked.  That is, the previously  current  frame
       is the one whose frame message will be modified.

       Permanent  duration  messages  are displayed when the user
       navigates to the command line.
