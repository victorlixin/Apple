       This  function is an TLI/XTI local management routine used
       to return the current state  of  the  provider  associated
       with the transport endpoint specified by fd.

       TLI/XTI states are changed by user events that reflect the
       success or failure of calls to the various  TLI/XTI  func-
       tions.   Because fewer TLI/XTI user events occur over con-
       nectionless services, there are fewer TLI/XTI states  than
       for connection-mode services.

       The  current  state  may  be one of the following: unbound
       idle outgoing connection pending  (connection  mode  only)
       incoming  connection  pending  (connection mode only) data
       transfer (connection mode only) outgoing  orderly  release
       (waiting  for  an  orderly release indication) (connection
       mode  only)  incoming  orderly  release  (waiting  for  an
       orderly release request) (connection mode only)

       t_getstate  may be issued  from  any  valid  state  except
       T_UNINIT and has no effect on the state.

       The t_getstate function is applicable to both  connection-
       mode and connectionless transport services.

       t_getstate returns the current state on successful comple-
       tion and -1 on failure and t_errno is set to indicate  the
       error.

   EErrrroorrss
       On  failure,  t_errno  may be set to one of the following:
       The specified file descriptor does not refer to  a  trans-
       port  endpoint.   The  transport  provider is undergoing a
       state change.  A system error has occurred  during  execu-
       tion  of  this function.  A communication problem has been
       detected with the transport provider and there is no other
       value of t_errno to describe the error condition.

                                                                1

       If  the  provider  is  undergoing  a state transition when
       t_getstate is called, the function will fail.
