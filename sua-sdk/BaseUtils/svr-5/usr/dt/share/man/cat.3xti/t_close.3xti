       This  function  is a TLI/XTI local management routine used
       to close a transport endpoint.  The t_close function indi-
       cates  to the transport provider that the user is finished
       with the transport endpoint specified by fd.  In addition,
       t_close closes the file associated with the transport end-
       point and frees any  local  library  resources  associated
       with the endpoint.

       t_close  should be called from the T_UNBND state (see How-
       ever, this function does not check state  information,  so
       it may be called from any valid state to close a transport
       endpoint.  If this occurs,  the  local  library  resources
       associated  with the endpoint will be freed automatically.

       t_close returns 0 on success and -1 on failure and t_errno
       is set to indicate the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       On failure, t_errno may be set to the following: The spec-
       ified file descriptor does not refer to a  transport  end-
       point.  A communication problem has been detected with the
       transport provider and there is no other value of  t_errno
       to describe the error condition.

WWaarrnniinnggss
       If t_close is issued while a transport address is bound to
       an endpoint, the address will be unbound.

       If t_close is called  when  the  transport  connection  is
       still  active,  the  connection  will be aborted, the file
       descriptor will be closed, and  the  transport  connection
       associated  with that endpoint will be broken for any pro-
       cess that references that endpoint.

       t_close should not be  issued  on  a  connection  endpoint

                                                                1
