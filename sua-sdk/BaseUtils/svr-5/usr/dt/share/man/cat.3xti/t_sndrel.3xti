       This function is a TLI/XTI connection release routine used
       to initiate an orderly release of a  transport  connection
       associated  with  the  transport endpoint specified by fd.
       t_sndrel indicates to  the  transport  provider  that  the
       transport user has no more data to send.

       This  function  is  an  optional  service of the transport
       provider and is only supported if the  transport  provider
       returned  service  type  T_COTS or T_COTS_ORD on t_open or
       t_getinfo.

       After  issuing  t_sndrel,  the  user may not send any more
       data over the connection.  However, a user may continue to
       receive data if an orderly release indication has not been
       received.

       If t_sndrel is issued from an invalid state, the  provider
       will  generate  an  EPROTO  protocol  error; however, this
       error may not occur until a subsequent  reference  to  the
       transport endpoint.

       t_sndrel  returns  0  on  success  and  -1  on failure and
       t_errno is set to indicate the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       On failure, t_errno may be set to one  of  the  following:
       The  specified  file descriptor does not refer to a trans-
       port endpoint.  O_NONBLOCK was set, but the  flow  control
       mechanism  prevented the transport provider from accepting
       the function at this time.  This function is not supported
       by  the underlying transport provider.  A system error has
       occurred during execution  of  this  function.   An  asyn-
       chronous  even has occurred on the transport endpoint ref-
       erenced by  fd  and  requires  immediate  attention.   The

       function was issued in the wrong sequence on the transport
       endpoint referenced by fd.  A  communication  problem  has
       been  detected with the transport provider and there is no
       other value of t_errno to describe the error condition.
