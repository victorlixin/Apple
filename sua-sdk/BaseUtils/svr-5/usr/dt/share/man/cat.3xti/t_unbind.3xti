       The  t_unbind  function is a TLI/XTI local management rou-
       tine used to disable the transport endpoint  specified  by
       fd  which  was  previously  bound by On completion of this
       call, no further data or events destined for  this  trans-
       port  endpoint will be accepted by the transport provider.

       t_unbind  returns  0  on  success  and  -1  on failure and
       t_errno is set to indicate the error.

   EErrrroorrss
       On failure, t_errno may be set to one  of  the  following:
       The  specified  file descriptor does not refer to a trans-
       port endpoint.  The  function  was  issued  in  the  wrong
       sequence.   An  asynchronous  event  has  occurred on this
       transport endpoint.  A system error  has  occurred  during
       execution  of  this function.  A communication problem has
       been detected with the transport provider and there is  no
       other value of t_errno to describe the error condition.
