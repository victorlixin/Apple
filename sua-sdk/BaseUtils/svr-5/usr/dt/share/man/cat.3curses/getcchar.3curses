       int  getcchar(const  cchar_t  *wcval, wchar_t *wch, attr_t
       *attrs,
                    short *color_pair, void *opts);

DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       When wch is not a  null  pointer,  the  function  extracts
       information  from  a  cchar_t defined by wcval, stores the
       character attributes in the object pointed  to  by  attrs,
       stores  the  colour  pair  in  the  object  pointed  to by
       color_pair, and stores the wide  character  string  refer-
       enced by wcval into the array pointed to by wch.

       When  wch  is  a  null pointer, obtains the number of wide
       characters in the object pointed to by wcval and does  not
       change the objects pointed to by attrs or color_pair.

       The  opts  argument is reserved for definition in a future
       edition of this document.  Currently, the application must
       provide a null pointer as opts.

       When  wch  is  a  null pointer, returns the number of wide
       characters referenced by wcval, including the null  termi-
       nator.

       When wch is not a null pointer, returns OK upon successful
       completion, and ERR otherwise.

       The wcval argument may be a value generated by a  call  to
       or  by  a function that has a cchar_t output argument.  If
       wcval is constructed by any other  means,  the  effect  is
       unspecified.
