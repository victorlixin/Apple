       These functions place a string of characters from the cur-
       rent or specified window into the array pointed to by str,
       starting at the current or specified position  and  ending
       at the end of the line.

       The  and  functions  store  at  most n bytes in the string
       pointed to by str.

       The and functions will only store  the  entire  multi-byte
       sequence  associated  with  a  character.  If the array is
       large enough to contain at least one character  the  array
       is  filled  with  complete characters. If the array is not
       large enough to contain any complete characters, the func-
       tion fails.

       Upon successful completion, and return OK.

       Upon successful completion, and return the number of char-
       acters actually read into the string.

       Otherwise, all these functions return ERR.

       No errors are defined.

UUssaaggee
       Since multi-byte characters may be processed, there  might
       not  be  a one-to-one correspondence between the number of
       column positions on the screen and  the  number  of  bytes
       returned.

       These functions do not return rendition information.

                                                                1

       Reading  a line that overflows the array pointed to by str
       with or causes undefined results.  The use of  or  respec-
       tively, is recommended.
