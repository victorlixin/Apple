       The  function determines the terminal type and initialises
       all implementation data structures.  The environment vari-
       able  specifies  the  terminal  type.   The  function also
       causes the first refresh operation to  clear  the  screen.
       If  errors  occur,  writes an appropriate error message to
       standard error and exits.  The only functions that can  be
       called  before  or  are and the functions whose prototypes
       are defined in <term.h>.  Portable applications  must  not
       call twice.

       The  function  can  be  called as many times as desired to
       attach a terminal device.  The type argument points  to  a
       string  specifying  the terminal type, except that if type
       is a null pointer, the environment variable is used.   The
       outfile  and infile arguments are file pointers for output
       to the terminal and input from the terminal, respectively.
       It  is  unspecified  whether Curses modifies the buffering
       mode of these  file  pointers.   The  function  should  be
       called once for each terminal.

       The  function  is  equivalent  to: newterm(getenv("TERM"),
       stdout, stdin); return stdscr; If the current  disposition
       for the signals SIGINT, SIGQUIT or SIGTSTP is SIGDFL, then
       may also install a  handler  for  the  signal,  which  may
       remain  in effect for the life of the process or until the
       process changes the disposition of the signal.

       The and functions initialise the cur_term  external  vari-
       able.

       Upon  successful  completion, returns a pointer to stdscr.
       Otherwise, it does not return.

       Upon successful completion, returns a pointer to the spec-
       ified terminal.  Otherwise, it returns a null pointer.

       A  program  that  outputs to more than one terminal should
       use for each terminal instead of A program that  needs  an
       indication  of error conditions, so it can continue to run
       in a line-oriented mode if the terminal cannot  support  a
       screen-oriented program, would also use this function.

                                                                1
