       The  function  looks  up  the termcap entry for name.  The
       emulation ignores the buffer pointer bp.

       The function gets the boolean entry for id.

       The function gets the numeric entry for id.

       The function gets the string entry for id.  If area is not
       a  null  pointer  and  does  not  point to a null pointer,
       copies the string entry into  the  buffer  pointed  to  by
       *area  and advances the variable pointed to by area to the
       first byte after the copy of the string entry.

       The function instantiates the parameters col and row  into
       the  capability cap and returns a pointer to the resulting
       string.

       All of the information available in the terminfo  database
       need not be available through these functions.

       Upon successful completion, functions that return an inte-
       ger return OK.  Otherwise, they return ERR.

       Functions that return pointers return a  null  pointer  on
       error.

       No errors are defined.

       These  functions are included as a conversion aid for pro-
       grams that use the termcap library.  Their  arguments  are
       the same and the functions are emulated using the terminfo
       database.

       These functions are only guaranteed to operate reliably on
       character  sets in which each character fits into a single
       byte, whose attributes can be expressed  using  only  con-
       stants with the A_ prefix.

                                                                1
