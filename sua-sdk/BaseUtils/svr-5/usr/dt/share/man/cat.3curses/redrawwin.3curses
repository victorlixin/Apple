       The  and  functions inform the implementation that some or
       all of the information physically displayed for the speci-
       fied  window  may have been corrupted.  The function marks
       the entire window; marks only num_lines lines starting  at
       line  number  beg_line.   The  functions  prevent the next
       refresh operation on that window from performing any opti-
       misation  based  on  assumptions  about what is physically
       displayed there.

       ment a command that redraws some or all of the screen.
