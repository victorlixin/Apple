       WINDOW  *derwin(WINDOW  *orig,  int nlines, int ncols, int
       begin_y,
                      int begin_x);

       The function is  the  same  as  except  that  begin_y  and
       begin_x  are  relative  to  the  origin of the window orig
       rather than absolute screen positions.

       The function creates a new window with  nlines  lines  and
       ncols  columns, positioned so that the origin is (begin_y,
       begin_x).  If nlines is  zero,  it  defaults  to  LINES  -
       begin_y;  if ncols is zero, it defaults to COLS - begin_x.

       The function creates a new window with  nlines  lines  and
       ncols  columns,  positioned  so  that  the  origin  is  at
       (begin_y, begin_x).  (This position is an absolute  screen
       position, not a position relative to the window orig.)  If
       any part of the new window is outside orig,  the  function
       fails and the window is not created.

       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions  return  a
       pointer to the new window.  Otherwise, they return a  null
       pointer.

UUssaaggee
       Before  performing  the  first  refresh  of  a  subwindow,
       portable applications should call or on the parent window.

       Each  window maintains internal descriptions of the screen
       image and status.  The screen image is  shared  among  all
       windows  in the window hierarchy.  Refresh operations rely
       on information on what has changed within a window,  which
       is  private  to  each  window.   Refreshing a window, when
       updates were made to a different window, may fail to  per-
       form  needed updates because the windows do not share this
       information.

       A new full-screen window is created by calling:  newwin(0,
       0, 0, 0);
