       These  functions  draw  a line in the current or specified
       window starting at  the  current  or  specified  position,
       using  ch.   The  line  is at most n positions long, or as
       many as fit into the window.

       These functions do not advance the cursor position.  These
       functions  do  not  perform  special character processing.
       These functions do not perform wrapping.

       The and functions draw a line proceeding toward  the  last
       column of the same line.

       These functions are only guaranteed to operate reliably on
       character sets in which each character fits into a  single
       byte,  whose  attributes  can be expressed using only con-
       stants with the A_ prefix.
