       The function determines whether all ancestors of the spec-
       ified window are implicitly touched whenever  there  is  a
       change in the window.  If bf is TRUE, such implicit touch-
       ing occurs.  If bf is FALSE, such implicit  touching  does
       not occur.  The initial state is FALSE.

       The  function  updates  the current cursor position of the
       ancestors of win to reflect the current cursor position of
       win.

       The  function  touches win if any ancestor window has been
       touched.

       The function unconditionally touches all ancestors of win.
