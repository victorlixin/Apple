       The function returns the current erase character.
        The  function  stores  the current erase character in the
       object pointed to by ch.  If no erase character  has  been
       defined,  the function will fail and the object pointed to
       by ch will not be changed.

       The function returns the current line kill character.  The
       function  stores  the  current  line kill character in the
       object pointed to by ch.  If no line  kill  character  has
       been  defined,  the  function  will  fail  and  the object
       pointed to by ch will not be changed.

RReettuurrnn vvaalluuee
       The function returns the erase character and  returns  the
       line kill character.  The return value is unspecified when
       these characters are multi-byte characters.

       Upon successful completion,  and  return  OK.   Otherwise,
       they return ERR.

       No errors are defined.

UUssaaggee
       The  and functions are only guaranteed to operate reliably
       on character sets in which each character fits into a sin-
       gle  byte,  whose  attributes  can be expressed using only
       constants with the A_ prefix.  Moreover, they do not reli-
       ably  indicate  cases in which when the erase or line kill
       character, respectively, has not been  defined.   The  and
       functions overcome these limitations.
