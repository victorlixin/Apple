DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The  function touches the specified window (that is, marks
       it as having changed more recently than the  last  refresh
       operation).  The function only touches count lines, begin-
       ning with line start.

       The function marks all lines in the  window  as  unchanged
       since the last refresh operation.

       Calling  if changed is 1, touches n lines in the specified
       window, starting at line y.  If changed is 0,  marks  such
       lines as unchanged since the last refresh operation.

       The  function  determines  whether the specified window is
       touched.  The function determines whether line line of the
       specified window is touched.

       The  and  functions  return  TRUE  if any of the specified
       lines, or the specified  window,  respectively,  has  been
       touched since the last refresh operation.  Otherwise, they
       return FALSE.

       Upon successful completion, the other functions return OK.
       Otherwise,  they return ERR.  Exceptions to this are noted
       in the preceding function descriptions.

       No errors are defined.

UUssaaggee
       Calling or is sometimes necessary when  using  overlapping
       windows,  since  a  change to one window affects the other
       window, but the records of which lines have  been  changed
       in the other window do not reflect the change.
