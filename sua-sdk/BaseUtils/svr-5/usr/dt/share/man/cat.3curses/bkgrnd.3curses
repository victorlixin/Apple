       The   and  functions  turn  off  the  previous  background
       attributes, OR the requested attributes  into  the  window
       rendition,  and set the background property of the current
       or specified window based on the information in wch.

       The  and  functions  turn  off  the  previous   background
       attributes,  OR  the  requested attributes into the window
       rendition, and set the background property of the  current
       or  specified  window and then apply this setting to every
       character position in that window: The rendition of  every
       character  on the screen is changed to the new window ren-
       dition.  Wherever the former background character appears,
       it is changed to the new background character.

       If  wch  refers to a non-spacing complex character for and
       then wch is added to the existing spacing complex  charac-
       ter  that is the background character.  If wch refers to a
       multi-column character, the results are unspecified.

       The and functions store, into the area pointed to by  wch,
       the  value of the window's background character and rendi-
       tion.
