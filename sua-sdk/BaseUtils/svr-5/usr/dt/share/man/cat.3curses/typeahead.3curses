       The  function controls the detection of typeahead during a
       refresh, based on the value of  fildes:  If  fildes  is  a
       valid   file   descriptor,  typeahead  is  enabled  during
       refresh; Curses periodically checks fildes for  input  and
       aborts  the  refresh if any character is available.  (This
       is the initial setting, and the typeahead file  descriptor
       corresponds  to  the input file associated with the screen
       created by or The value of fildes need  not  be  the  file
       descriptor  on  which the refresh is occurring.  If fildes
       is -1, Curses does not check for typeahead during refresh.
