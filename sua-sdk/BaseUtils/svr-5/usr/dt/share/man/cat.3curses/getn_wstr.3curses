       The effect of is as though a series of calls to were made,
       until a newline character, end-of-line character, or  end-
       of-file  character is processed.  An end-of-file character
       is represented by WEOF, as defined in <wchar.h>.   A  new-
       line  or  end-of-line is represented as its wchar_t value.
       In all instances, the end of the string is terminated by a
       null wchar_t.  The resulting values are placed in the area
       pointed to by wstr.

       The user's erase and kill characters are  interpreted  and
       affect the sequence of characters returned.

       Upon  successful  completion,  these  functions return OK.
       Otherwise, they return ERR.

       Reading a line that overflows the array pointed to by wstr
       with  or  causes undefined results.  The use of or respec-
       tively, is recommended.

       These functions cannot return KEY_ values as there  is  no
       way  to  distinguish  a  KEY_  value  from a valid wchar_t
       value.
