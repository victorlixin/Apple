       These functions read a single-byte character from the ter-
       minal associated with the current or specified window.  If
       is  enabled,  these functions respond to the pressing of a
       function key by returning  the  corresponding  KEY_  value
       defined in curses.h.

       Processing  of  terminal  input  is subject to the general
       rules described in

       If the current or specified window is not a  pad,  and  it
       has  been  moved or modified since the last refresh opera-
       tion, then it will be refreshed before  another  character
       is read.

       Upon  successful  completion  and  return  the single-byte
       character, KEY_ value, or ERR.  When in the  nodelay  mode
       and no data is available, ERR is returned.

       No errors are defined.

UUssaaggee
       Applications should not define the escape key by itself as
       a single-character function.

       When using these functions, mode and mode  should  not  be
       used at the same time.  Depending on the state of the ter-
       minal when each character is typed, the program  may  pro-
       duce undesirable results.
