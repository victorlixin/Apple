       Most  cases  in  which a Curses function has the mv prefix
       indicate that the function takes y  and  x  arguments  and
       moves  the  cursor  to  that  address as though were first
       called.  (The corresponding functions without the mv  pre-
       fix  operate  at  the cursor position.)  The and functions
       are exceptions to this rule, in that mv is  not  a  prefix
       with  the  usual  meaning  and  there are no corresponding
       functions without the mv  prefix.   These  functions  have
       entries under their own names.

       In  the and functions, mv is a prefix with the usual mean-
       ing, but the functions have entries under their own  names
       because  the mv function is the first function in the fam-
       ily of functions in alphabetical order.

       The mv prefix is combined  with  a  w  prefix  to  produce
       Curses functions beginning with mvw.

       The  mv  and mvw functions are discussed together with the
       corresponding functions that do not have  these  prefixes.
       They are found on the following entries:
