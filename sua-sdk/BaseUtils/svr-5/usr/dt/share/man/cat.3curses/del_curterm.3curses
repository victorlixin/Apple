       These  functions  retrieve  information  from the terminfo
       database.

       To gain access to the terminfo database,  must  be  called
       first.   It  is  automatically  called by and The function
       initialises the other functions to use the terminfo record
       for  a  specified  terminal  (which depends on whether was
       called).  It sets the cur_term external variable to a TER-
       MINAL structure that contains the record from the terminfo
       database for the specified terminal.

       The terminal type is the character string term; if term is
       a null pointer, the environment variable TERM is used.  If
       TERM is not set or if its value is an empty  string,  then
       "unknown"  is  used as the terminal type.  The application
       must set fildes to a file descriptor, open for output,  to
       the terminal device, before calling If errret is not null,
       the integer it points to is set to one  of  the  following
       values  to  report  the  function  outcome:  The  terminfo
       database was not found (function fails).   The  entry  for
       the  terminal  was not found in terminfo (function fails).
       Success.

       If detects an error and errret is a null pointer, writes a
       diagnostic message and exits.

       A  simple call to that uses all the defaults and sends the
       output to stdout is: setupterm((char *)0,  fileno(stdout),
       (int  *)0);  The  function  sets  the variable cur_term to
       nterm, and makes all of the terminfo boolean, numeric, and
       string variables use the values from nterm.

       The function frees the space pointed to by oterm and makes
       it available for further use.  If oterm  is  the  same  as
       cur_term,  references  to  any  of  the  terminfo boolean,
       numeric, and string  variables  thereafter  may  refer  to
       invalid memory locations until is called again.

       The  function  assumes a previous call to (perhaps from or
       It lets the application specify a different terminal  type
       in  term  and updates the information returned by based on
