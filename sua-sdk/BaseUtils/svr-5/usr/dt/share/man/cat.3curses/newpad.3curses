       The function creates a specialised WINDOW  data  structure
       representing a pad with nlines lines and ncols columns.  A
       pad is like a window, except that it  is  not  necessarily
       associated  with a viewable part of the screen.  Automatic
       refreshes of pads do not occur.

       The function creates a subwindow within a pad with  nlines
       lines and ncols columns.  Unlike which uses screen coordi-
       nates, the window is at position (begin_y, begin_x) on the
       pad.  The window is made in the middle of the window orig,
       so that changes made to one window affect both windows.

       The and functions are analogous to and  except  that  they
       relate  to  pads instead of windows.  The additional argu-
       ments indicate  what  part  of  the  pad  and  screen  are
       involved.   The  pminrow and pmincol arguments specify the
       origin of the rectangle to be displayed in the  pad.   The
       sminrow,  smincol,  smaxrow  and smaxcol arguments specify
       the edges of the rectangle to be displayed on the  screen.
       The  lower  right-hand  corner of the rectangle to be dis-
       played in the pad is calculated from  the  screen  coordi-
       nates,  since  the rectangles must be the same size.  Both
       rectangles must be entirely contained within their respec-
       tive  structures.   Negative  values  of pminrow, pmincol,
       sminrow or smincol are treated as if they were zero.

       Upon successful completion, the  and  functions  return  a
       pointer  to the pa data structure.  Otherwise, they return
       a null pointer.

       Upon successful completion,  and  return  OK.   Otherwise,
       they return ERR.

UUssaaggee
       To  refresh  a  pad,  call or not When porting code to use
       pads from WINDOWS, remember that these  functions  require
       additional  arguments to specify the part of the pad to be
       displayed and the location on the screen to  be  used  for
       the display.

       Although  a  subwindow and its parent pad may share memory
       representing characters in the pad, they  need  not  share
       status  information  about  what  has  changed in the pad.
       Therefore, after modifying a subwindow within  a  pad,  it
       may be necessary to call or on the pad before calling
