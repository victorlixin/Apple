       These  functions  set options that deal with output within
       Curses.

       The function assigns the value of bf to an  internal  flag
       in  the  specified  window  that  governs  clearing of the
       screen during a refresh.  If, during a  refresh  operation
       on the specified window, the flag in curscr is TRUE or the
       flag in the specified window is TRUE, then the implementa-
       tion  clears  the  screen, redraws it in its entirety, and
       sets the flag to FALSE in curscr and in the specified win-
       dow.  The initial state is unspecified.

       The  function specifies whether the implementation may use
       the hardware insert-line, delete-line, and scroll features
       of  terminals  so  equipped.   If bf is TRUE, use of these
       features is enabled.  If bf is FALSE, use  of  these  fea-
       tures  is  disabled  and  lines  are  instead  redrawn  as
       required.  The initial state is FALSE.

       The function controls the cursor position after a  refresh
       operation.  If bf is TRUE, refresh operations on the spec-
       ified window may leave the terminal's cursor at  an  arbi-
       trary  position.   If  bf is FALSE, then at the end of any
       refresh operation, the terminal's cursor is positioned  at
       the  cursor  position  contained  in the specified window.
       The initial state is FALSE.

       The function controls the use  of  scrolling.   If  bf  is
       TRUE,  then scrolling is enabled for the specified window,
       with  the  consequences  discussed  in  If  bf  is  FALSE,
       scrolling  is disabled for the specified window.  The ini-
       tial state is FALSE.

       The and functions define a software  scrolling  region  in
       the  current  or  specified window.  The top and bot argu-
       ments are the line numbers of  the  first  and  last  line
       defining the scrolling region.  (Line 0 is the top line of
       the window.)  If this option and are enabled,  an  attempt

                                                                1

       to  move  off the last line of the margin causes all lines
       in the scrolling region to scroll one line in  the  direc-
       tion of the first line.  Only characters in the window are
       scrolled.  If a software scrolling region is  set  and  is
       not  enabled,  an attempt to move off the last line of the
       margin does not reposition  any  lines  in  the  scrolling
       region.

       they return ERR.

       The other functions always return OK.

       The only reason to enable the feature is to use  scrolling
       to  achieve  the visual effect of motion of a partial win-
       dow, such as for a screen editor.   In  other  cases,  the
       feature can be visually annoying.

       The  option  provides  greater efficiency for applications
       that do not use the cursor.
