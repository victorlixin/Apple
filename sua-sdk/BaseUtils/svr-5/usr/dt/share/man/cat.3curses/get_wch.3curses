       These functions read a character from the terminal associ-
       ated with the current or specified window.  If is enabled,
       these  functions respond to the pressing of a function key
       by setting the object pointed to by ch to the  correspond-
       ing   KEY_  value  defined  in  <curses.h>  and  returning
       KEY_CODE_YES.

       Processing of terminal input is  subject  to  the  general
       rules described in

       If  the  current  or specified window is not a pad, and it
       has been moved or modified since the last  refresh  opera-
       tion,  then  it will be refreshed before another character
       is read.

       When these functions successfully report the pressing of a
       function  key,  they  return KEY_CODE_YES.  When they suc-
       cessfully report a wide character, they return OK.  Other-
       wise, they return ERR.

       Applications should not define the escape key by itself as
       a single-character function.

       When using these functions, mode and mode  should  not  be
       used at the same time.  Depending on the state of the ter-
       minal when each character is typed,  the  application  may
       produce undesirable results.
