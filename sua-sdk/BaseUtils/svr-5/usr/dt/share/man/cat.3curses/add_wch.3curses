       These functions add information to the current  or  speci-
       fied window at the current or specified position, and then
       advance the cursor.   These  functions  perform  wrapping.
       These  functions perform special-character processing.  If
       wch refers to a spacing character, then any previous char-
       acter  at that location is removed, a new character speci-
       fied by wch is placed  at  that  location  with  rendition
       specified  by  wch;  then  the cursor advances to the next
       spacing character on the screen.  If wch refers to a  non-
       spacing  character,  all previous characters at that loca-
       tion are preserved, the non-spacing characters of wch  are
       added  to the spacing complex character, and the rendition
       specified by wch is ignored.
