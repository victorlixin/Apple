       The function outputs one or more commands to the  terminal
       that  move  the  terminal's cursor to (newrow, newcol), an
       absolute position on the terminal  screen.   The  (oldrow,
       oldcol)  arguments  specify  the  former  cursor position.
       Specifying the former position is necessary  on  terminals
       that  do  not  provide coordinate-based movement commands.
       On terminals  that  provide  these  commands,  Curses  may
       select  a  more  efficient way to move the cursor based on
       the former position.  If (newrow, newcol) is not  a  valid
       address  for the terminal in use, fails.  If (oldrow, old-
       col) is the same as (newrow, newcol), then succeeds  with-
       out  taking any action.  If outputs a cursor movement com-
       mand, it updates its information concerning  the  location
       of the cursor on the terminal.

       Upon  successful  completion,  returns  OK.  Otherwise, it
       returns ERR.

       After use of the model Curses maintains of  the  state  of
       the  terminal might not match the actual state of the ter-
       minal.  The application should touch and refresh the  win-
       dow before resuming conventional use of Curses.
