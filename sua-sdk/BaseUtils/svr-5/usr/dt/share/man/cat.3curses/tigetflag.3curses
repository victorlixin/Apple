       The and functions obtain boolean, numeric and string capa-
       bilities,  respectively,  from  the selected record of the
       terminfo database.  For each capability, the value to  use
       as capname appears in the Capname column in the tables in

       The  function takes as cap a string capability.  If cap is
       parameterised  resolves  the  parameterisation.   If   the
       parameterised  string refers to parameters p1 through %p9,
       then substitutes the values  of  p1  through  p9,  respec-
       tively.

       Upon successful completion, and return the specified capa-
       bility.  The function returns  -1  if  capname  is  not  a
       boolean capability.  The function returns -2 if capname is
       not a numeric capability.  The function returns (char *)-1
       if capname is not a string capability.

       Upon successful completion, returns str with parameterisa-
       tion resolved.  Otherwise, it returns a null pointer.

       For parameterised  string  capabilities,  the  application
       should pass the return value from to as described above.

       Applications   intending  to  send  terminal  capabilities
       directly to the terminal (which should only be done  using
       or  instead of using Curses, normally should obey the fol-
       lowing rules: Call to restore  the  display  modes  before
       exiting.  If using cursor addressing, output enter_ca_mode
       upon startup and output exit_ca_mode before  exiting.   If
       using  shell  escapes, output exit_ca_mode and call before
       calling the shell; call  and  output  enter_ca_mode  after
       returning from the shell.

       All  parameterised  terminal  capabilities defined in this
       document can be  passed  to  Some  implementations  create
       their  own  capabilities,  create  capabilities  for  non-
