       These  functions  output  commands  to  the  terminal that
       change the terminal's attributes.

       If the terminfo database indicates that  the  terminal  in
       use  can  display characters in the rendition specified by
       attr, then outputs one or more commands  to  request  that
       the  terminal display subsequent characters in that rendi-
       tion.  The function outputs by calling The  function  nei-
       ther  relies  on  nor updates the model which Curses main-
       tains of the prior rendition mode.

       The function computes the same terminal output string that
       does,  based on attr, but outputs by calling the user-sup-
       plied function putfunc.  The and functions  correspond  to
       and respectively, but take a set of arguments, one of type
       attr_t for the   attributes, short  for  the  colour  pair
       number  and  a void *, and thus support the attribute con-
       stants with the WA_ prefix.

       The opts argument is reserved for definition in  a  future
       edition of this document.  Currently, the application must
       provide a null pointer as opts.

       The user-supplied function putfunc (which can be specified
       as  an argument to either or is either or some other func-
       tion with the same prototype.  Both the and  the  function
       ignore the return value of putfunc.

       Otherwise, they return ERR.

       After use of any of  these  functions,  the  model  Curses
       maintains of the state of the terminal might not match the
       actual state of  the  terminal.   The  application  should

                                                                1

       touch  and refresh the window before resuming conventional
       use of Curses.

       Use of these functions requires that the application  con-
       tain  so much information about a particular class of ter-
       minal that it defeats the purpose of using Curses.

       On some terminals, a command to change rendition conceptu-
       ally  occupies space in the screen buffer (with or without
       width).  Thus, a command to set the terminal to a new ren-
       dition  would  change  the  rendition  of  some characters
       already displayed.
