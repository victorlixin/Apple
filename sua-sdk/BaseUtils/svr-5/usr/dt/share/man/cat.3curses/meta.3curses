       Initially, whether the terminal returns 7 or 8 significant
       bits on input depends on the control mode of  the  display
       driver  (see  and  To  force 8 bits to be returned, invoke
       meta(win, TRUE).  To force 7 bits to be  returned,  invoke
       meta(win, FALSE).  The win argument is always ignored.  If
       the terminfo capabilities smm (meta_on) and rmm (meta_off)
       are  defined for the terminal, smm is sent to the terminal
       when meta(win, TRUE)  is  called  and  rmm  is  sent  when
       meta(win, FALSE) is called.

       The same effect is achieved outside Curses using  the  CS7
       or CS8 control mode flag specified on the manual page.

       The  function  was  designed  for  use with terminals with
       7-bit character sets and a meta key that could be used  to
       set the eighth bit.
