       The function specifies a mapping of characters.  The func-
       tion identifies a mapped area of the parent of the  speci-
       fied  window,  whose  size  is the same as the size of the
       specified window and whose origin is at (par_y, par_x)  of
       the  parent  window.   During any refresh of the specified
       window, the characters displayed in that window's  display
       area  of the terminal are taken from the mapped area.  Any
       references to characters in the specified window obtain or
       modify characters in the mapped area.

       That  is,  defines  a  coordinate transformation from each
       position in the mapped area to  a  corresponding  position
       (same  y,  x offset from the origin) in the specified win-
       dow.
