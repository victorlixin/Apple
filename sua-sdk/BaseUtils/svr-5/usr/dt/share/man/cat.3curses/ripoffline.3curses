       The function reserves a screen line for use by the  appli-
       cation.

       Any  call  to must precede the call to or If line is posi-
       tive, one line is removed from the beginning of stdscr; if
       line  is  negative,  one  line  is  removed  from the end.
       Removal occurs during the subsequent call to or  When  the
       subsequent  call  is made, the function pointed to by init
       is called with two arguments:  a  WINDOW  pointer  to  the
       one-line  window  that  has  been allocated and an integer
       with the number of columns in the window.  The initialisa-
       tion function cannot use the LINES and COLS external vari-
       ables and cannot call or but may call

       Up to five lines can be ripped off.  Calls to  above  this
       limit have no effect but report success.

       Calling  reduces  the  size  of  the screen by one line if
       eventually uses a line from stdscr  to  emulate  the  soft
       labels.  If rips off a line, it thereby reduces by one the
       number of lines an application can reserve  by  subsequent
       calls  to  Thus, portable applications that use soft label
       functions should not call more than four times.

       When or calls the initialisation function  pointed  to  by
       init,  the  implementation  may  pass  NULL for the WINDOW
       pointer argument win.  This indicates inability  to  allo-
       cate  a  one-line  window  for  the  line that the call to
       ripped off.  Portable applications should verify that  win
       is  not NULL before performing any operation on the window
       it represents.
