       The  function  writes  the current contents of the virtual
       screen to the file named by filename.

       The function sets the virtual screen to  the  contents  of
       the  file  named by filename, which must have been written
       using The next refresh operation restores  the  screen  to
       the way it looked in the dump file.

       The function reads the contents of the file named by file-
       name and uses them to initialise the  Curses  data  struc-
       tures  to  what  the terminal currently has on its screen.
       The next refresh  operation  bases  any  updates  on  this
       information,  unless either of the following conditions is
       true: The terminal has been written to since  the  virtual
       screen  was  dumped  to filename The terminfo capabilities
       rmcup and nrrmc are defined for the current terminal.

       The function is a combination of and It tells the  program
       that the information in the file named by filename is what
       is currently on the screen,  and  also  what  the  program
       wants  on  the screen.  This can be thought of as a screen
       inheritance function.
