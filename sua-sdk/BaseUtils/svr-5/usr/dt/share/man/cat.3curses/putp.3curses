       These functions output commands contained in the  terminfo
       database to the terminal.

       The function is equivalent to tputs(str, 1, putchar).  The
       output of always goes to stdout, not to the fildes  speci-
       fied in

       The  function  outputs str to the terminal.  The str argu-
       ment must be a terminfo  string  variable  or  the  return
       value  from  or The affcnt argument is the number of lines
       affected,  or  1  if  not  applicable.   If  the  terminfo
       database  indicates  that  the  terminal  in  use requires
       padding after any command in the generated string, inserts
       pad  characters into the string that is sent to the termi-
       nal, at positions indicated by the terminfo database.  The
       function outputs each character of the generated string by
       calling the user-supplied function putfunc (see below).

       The user-supplied function putfunc (specified as an  argu-
       ment  to  is  either  or some other function with the same
       prototype.  The function ignores the return value of  put-
       func.

       Changing the terminal attributes using these functions may
       cause  the renditions of characters within a curses window
       to be altered on some terminals.

       After use of any of  these  functions,  the  model  Curses
       maintains of the state of the terminal might not match the
       actual state of  the  terminal.   The  application  should
       touch  and refresh the window before resuming conventional
       use of Curses.
