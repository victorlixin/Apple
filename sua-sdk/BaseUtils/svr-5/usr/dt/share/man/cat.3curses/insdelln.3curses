       The  and  functions perform the following actions: If n is
       positive, these functions insert n lines into the  current
       or  specified  window before the current line.  The n last
       lines are no longer displayed.  If n  is  negative,  these
       functions  delete  n  lines  from the current or specified
       window starting  with  the  current  line,  and  move  the
       remaining  lines  toward the cursor.  The last n lines are
       cleared.

       The current cursor position remains the same.
