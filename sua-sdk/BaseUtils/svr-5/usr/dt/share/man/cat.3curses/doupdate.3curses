DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The and functions refresh the current or specified window.
       The functions position the terminal's cursor at the cursor
       position  of  the window, except that if the mode has been
       enabled, they may leave the cursor at an  arbitrary  posi-
       tion.

       The  function  determines  which parts of the terminal may
       need updating.  The function sends  to  the  terminal  the
       commands to perform any required changes.

UUssaaggee
       Refreshing an entire window is  typically  more  efficient
       than  refreshing  several subwindows separately.  An effi-
       cient sequence is to  call  on  each  subwindow  that  has
       changed, followed by a call to which updates the terminal.

       The or function (or followed by must  be  called  to  send
       output  to  the terminal, as other Curses functions merely
       manipulate data structures.
