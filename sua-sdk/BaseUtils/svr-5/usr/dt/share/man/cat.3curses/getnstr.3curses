       The effect of is as though a series of calls to were made,
       until   a  newline,  carriage  return  or  end-of-file  is
       received.  The resulting  value  is  placed  in  the  area
       pointed  to  by str.  The string is then terminated with a
       null byte.
        The and functions read at most n bytes, thus preventing a
       possible overflow of the input buffer.
        The  user's erase and kill characters are interpreted, as
       well as any special keys (such as function keys, home key,
       clear key, and so on).

       The  function  is identical to except that it is as though
       it is a call to and then a series of calls to

       The  and  functions will only return the entire multi-byte
       sequence associated with a character.   If  the  array  is
       large  enough to contain at least one character, the func-
       tions fill the array  with  complete  characters.  If  the
       array  is not large enough to contain any complete charac-
       ters, the function fails.

       Upon successful completion,  these  functions  return  OK.
       Otherwise, they return ERR.
