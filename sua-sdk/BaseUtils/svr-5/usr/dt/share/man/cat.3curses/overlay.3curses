       The  and  functions  overlay srcwin on top of dstwin.  The
       scrwin and dstwin arguments need not  be  the  same  size;
       only text where the two windows overlap is copied.

       The function copies characters as though a sequence of and
       were performed with the  destination  window's  attributes
       and background attributes cleared.

       The  function does the same thing, except that, whenever a
       character to be copied is the background character of  the
       source  window,  does  not  copy  the character but merely
       moves the destination cursor the width of the source back-
       ground character.

       If  any portion of the overlaying window border is not the
       first column of a multi-column character then all the col-
       umn positions will be replaced with the background charac-
       ter and rendition before  the  overlay  is  done.  If  the
       default  background  character is a multi-column character
       when this occurs, then these functions fail.
