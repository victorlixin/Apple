       The Curses interface manipulates the set of soft function-
       key labels that exist on many terminals.  For those termi-
       nals  that  do not have soft labels, Curses takes over the
       bottom line of stdscr, reducing the size of stdscr and the
       value  of the LINES external variable.  There can be up to
       eight labels of up to eight display columns each.

       To use soft labels, must be called before  or  is  called.
       If  eventually uses a line from stdscr to emulate the soft
       labels, then fmt determines how the labels are arranged on
       the  screen.   Setting fmt to 0 indicates a 3-2-3 arrange-
       ment of the labels; 1 indicates a 4-4 arrangement.   Other
       values for fmt are unspecified.

       The  function  has  the  effect  of calling to reserve one
       screen line to accommodate the requested format.

                                                                1

       The and functions specify the text of  soft  label  number
       labnum,  within  the range from 1 to and including 8.  The
       label argument is the string to be put on the label.  With
       and  the  width  of  the  label is limited to eight column
       positions.  A null string or a null  pointer  specifies  a
       blank  label.  The justify argument can have the following
       values to indicate how to justify label within  the  space
       reserved  for  it: Align the start of label with the start
       of the space Center label within the space Align  the  end
       of label with the end of the space

       The and functions correspond to the and functions.

       The function obtains soft label number labnum.

       The  function  immediately clears the soft labels from the
       screen.

       The function immediately restores the soft labels  to  the
       screen after a call to

       The  function  forces all the soft labels to be output the
       next time or is called.

       The and functions correspond to and They  have  an  effect
       only  if  soft  labels are simulated on the bottom line of
       the screen.

       The and functions correspond to and and thus  support  the
       attribute constants with the WA_ prefix and colour.

       The  opts  argument is reserved for definition in a future
       edition of this document. Currently, the application  must
       provide a null pointer as opts.

       Upon  successful  completion,  returns the requested label
       with leading and trailing blanks stripped.  Otherwise,  it
       returns a null pointer.

       Upon successful completion, the other functions return OK.
       Otherwise, they return ERR.
