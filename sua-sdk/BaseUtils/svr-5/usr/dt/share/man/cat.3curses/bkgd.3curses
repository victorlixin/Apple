       The   and  functions  turn  off  the  previous  background
       attributes, logical OR the requested attributes  into  the
       window  rendition,  and set the background property of the
       current or specified window based on  the  information  in
       ch.  If ch refers to a multi-column character, the results
       are undefined.

       The  and  functions  turn  off  the  previous   background
       attributes,  logical  OR the requested attributes into the
       window rendition, and set the background property  of  the
       current or specified window and then apply this setting to
       every character position in that window: The rendition  of
       every character on the screen is changed to the new window
       rendition.   Wherever  the  former  background   character
       appears, it is changed to the new background character.

       The  function  extracts  the specified window's background
       character and rendition.

       The and functions do not return a value.

       Upon successful completion, returns the specified window's

       These functions are only guaranteed to operate reliably on
       character sets in which each character fits into a  single
       byte,  whose  attributes  can be expressed using only con-
       stants with the A_ prefix.
