       The function draws a border around the edges of the speci-
       fied window.  This function does not  advance  the  cursor
       position.   This function does not perform special charac-
       ter processing.  This function does not perform  wrapping.

       The  function box(win, verch, horch) has an effect equiva-
       lent to:

       wborder(win, verch, verch, horch, horch, 0, 0, 0, 0);

       These functions are only guaranteed to operate reliably on
       character sets in which each character fits into a  single
       byte,  whose  attributes  can be expressed using only con-
       stants with the A_ prefix.
