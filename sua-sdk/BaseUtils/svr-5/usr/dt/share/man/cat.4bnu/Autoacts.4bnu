       The  /etc/ics/Autoacts  file  contains  a list of incoming
       byte sequences to detect, and  an  associated  service  to
       invoke  if  that  sequence  is matched.  This detection is
       performed by the port monitor before the login  banner  or
       anything  else  is sent to the output stream.  The current
       use of this file is to provide auto-detection of PPP.

       Autoacts contains the following fields in the order shown:
       A  label  to  identify  the service and byte sequence.  At
       present, this is not used.  The service to be invoked upon
       matching  the incoming byte sequence.  A list of arguments
       to be supplied to the service.  The sequence of bytes that
       identifies the service.
