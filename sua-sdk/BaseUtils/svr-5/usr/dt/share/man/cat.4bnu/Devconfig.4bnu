       The /etc/uucp/Devconfig file specifies the STREAMS modules
       and network devices used to provide and  services  over  a
       TCP network or some other TLI-conformant provider.

       Each entry in the Devconfig file consists of a single log-
       ical line.  Physical lines may be terminated  by  a  back-
       slash (\) to indicate that the entry continues on the next
       line.  Comment lines begin with a hash sign (#) and occupy
       the  entire  line  up to a newline character.  Blank lines
       are ignored (even within multi-line entries).

       Each entry contains the following: svc_name specifies  cu,
       uucico,  or  both separated by a colon dev_name identifies
       the name of a network specified in the first field  of  an
       entry  in  the  file  mod_name  specifies the names of the
       STREAMS modules associated with the service, in the  order
       in which they are to be pushed onto the stream

       Different  modules  and  devices can be defined for cu and
       uucico services.

       If you create entries in the Devconfig file, you must also
       create an entry for the TCP network in the Devices file.

       If you want to change the contents of the file, use one of
       the available text editors.

       If you are using TCP/IP, the two entries shown  below  are
       all   you   need   in   the   Devconfig  file:  service=cu
       device=TCP   push=ntty:tirdwr  service=uucico   device=TCP
       push=ntty:tirdwr  In  this  example, ntty is pushed first,
       then tirdwr.  ntty is a hardware emulation module.  tirdwr
       is the Transport Interface read/write interface module.
