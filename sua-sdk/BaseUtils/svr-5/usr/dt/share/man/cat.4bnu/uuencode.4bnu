       Files  output  by  consist of a header line, followed by a
       number of body lines, and a  trailer  line.   ignores  any
       lines preceding the header or following the trailer.  Note
       that any lines preceding a header must  not  look  like  a
       header.

       The  header  line  is  distinguished by having the first 6
       characters begin  (the word begin followed  by  a  space).
       begin   is  followed  by  a  mode (in octal), and a string
       which names the remote file.  Spaces  separate  the  three
       items in the header line.

       The  body  consists  of a number of lines, each at most 62
       characters long (including the trailing  newline).   These
       consist  of a character count, followed by encoded charac-
       ters, followed by a newline.  The  character  count  is  a
       single  printing  character,  and represents the number of
       bytes that the rest of the line contains.   Such  integers
       are always in the range from 0 to 63 and can be determined
       by subtracting an ASCII space (octal 40) from the  charac-
       ter count.

       Groups  of  3 bytes are stored in 4 characters, 6 bits per
       character.  All are offset by a space to make the  charac-
       ters  printable.   The  last  line may be shorter than the
       usual 45 bytes.  If the size is not a multiple of 3,  this
       fact  can  be  determined by the value of the count on the
       last line.  Extra characters will be included to make  the
       character  count  a multiple of 4.  The body is terminated
       by a line with a count of zero.  This line consists of one
       ASCII space.

       The  trailer  line  consists  of the word end on a line by
       itself.
