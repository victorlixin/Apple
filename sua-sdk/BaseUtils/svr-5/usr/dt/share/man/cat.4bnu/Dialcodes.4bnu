       The  /etc/uucp/Dialcodes file contains dial-code abbrevia-
       tions  that  can  be  used  in  the  Phone  field  of  the
       /etc/uucp/Systems file.

       Each  Dialcodes file entry has the format: abbrev dial_seq
       where abbrev is the abbreviation used in the Systems  file
       Phone  field  and  dial_seq  is  the dial sequence that is
       passed to the dialer when  that  particular  Systems  file
       entry is accessed.

       The Dialcodes file works closely with the and files.  Note
       that a change to an entry in one file may require a change
       to a related entry in another file.

       The  default  Dialcodes  file delivered with the system is
       empty.  It is not necessary for the  system  administrator
       to do anything to the file.

       The  Dialcodes  file  entry:  jt 9=555- would be set up to
       work with a Phone  field  in  the  Systems  file  such  as
       jt7867.   When the entry containing jt7867 is encountered,
       the sequence 9=555-7867 would be sent to the dialer if the
       token in the dialer-token pair is \T.
