       The /etc/uucp/Grades file gives system administrators  the
       ability  to  define  the  job  grades (and the permissions
       associated with each job grade) that users may specify  to
       queue jobs to a remote computer.

       The  fields in the Grades file are as follows: Establishes
       an administrator-defined user job grade name of up  to  64
       characters.   Specifies  the  one  character  job grade to
       which user_job_grade is to be mapped.  The valid  list  of
       characters  is A-Z and a-z, with A having the highest pri-
       ority and z the lowest.  Specifies the  maximum  job  size
       that can be entered in the queue by this system_job_grade.
       job_size is measured in bytes and may be  a  list  of  the
       following:  where  nnnn  is  an integer that specifies the
       maximum job size for this job grade where n is  a  decimal
       number that represents the number of kilobytes and K is an
       abbreviation for kilobyte where n is a decimal number that
       represents  the  number of megabytes and M is an abbrevia-
       tion for megabyte a keyword to specify that  there  is  no
       maximum job size

       For example: represents 5000 bytes represents 10 kilobytes
       represents 2 megabytes Contains a keyword that denotes how
       to  interpret  the  contents  of id_list (see below).  The
       keywords and their  meanings  are:  id_list  contains  the
       login  names  of  users  permitted  to use this job grade.
       id_list contains the login names of users not permitted to
       use  this  job  grade.   id_list  contains the group names
       whose members are permitted to use  this  group.   id_list
       contains  the  group names whose members are not permitted
       to use this job grade.  Contains a list of login names  or
       group  names that are to be permitted or denied queuing to
       this job grade.  The list of names are separated by  white
       space  and terminated by a newline character.  The keyword
       Any denotes that anyone is permitted to queue to this  job
       grade.

       The  fields  in a Grades file entry are separated by white
       space.  The last field in  each  entry  consists  of  sub-
       fields  that  are also white-space separated.  If an entry
       takes up more than one physical line, then a backslash (\)
       is  used  to  continue  the entry onto the following line.
       Comment lines begin with a hash sign (#)  and  occupy  the
       entire line.  Blank lines are ignored.

       The  Grades  file  should  only be administered if you are
       using job grades.  If you are not using job grades, it  is
       not  necessary  to  modify this file.  The system-supplied

                                                                1

       Grades file contains the following three  default  grades:
       high     F       Any      User      Any medium  S      Any
       User      Any low     n      Any       User       Any  The
       user  job  grade  may be bound to more than one system job
       grade.  Note that the Grades file will be searched sequen-
       tially  for  occurrences  of a user job grade.  Therefore,
       any multiple occurrences of a system job grade  should  be
       listed  according  to  the  restriction on the maximum job
       size.

       While there is no maximum number for the user job  grades,
       the  maximum  number  of  system job grades allowed is 52.
       The reason is that more than  one  user_job_grade  can  be
       mapped to a system_job_grade, but each user_job_grade must
       be on a separate line in the Grades  file.   For  example:
       mail       N      Any     User     Any netnews   N     Any
       User     Any Given this configuration, these two user  job
       grades  will  share  the same system job grade.  Since the
       permissions for a job grade are associated with a user job
       grade  and not a system job grade, it is even possible for
       two user job grades to share the same  system  job  grades
       and have two different sets of permissions for each one.

       As an administrator, a default user job grade can be bound
       to a system job  grade.   To  do  this,  use  the  keyword
       default  as user job grade in the user_job_grade field and
       the system job grade to which it is bound.   The  restric-
       tions  and  ID fields should be defined as Any so that any
       user and any size job can be queued to  this  grade.   For
       example: default   a      Any      User      Any If you do
       not define the default user job grade, then  the  built-in
       default  grade  (Z)  will  be used.  Because it is assumed
       that the restriction field is Any, multiple occurrences of
       the default grade are not checked.
