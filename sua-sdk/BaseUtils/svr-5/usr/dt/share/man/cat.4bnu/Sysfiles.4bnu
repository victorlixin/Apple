       The  /etc/uucp/Sysfiles  file  gives the administrator the
       ability to break the logical Systems, Dialers and  Devices
       files  into multiple physical files.  This makes it possi-
       ble for and to use different Systems, Dialers and  Devices
       files.

       Each entry in the Sysfiles file consists of a single logi-
       cal line.  Physical lines may be terminated by a backslash
       (\) to indicate that the entry continues on the next line.
       Comment lines begin with a hash sign (#)  and  occupy  the
       entire  line  up  to a newline character.  Blank lines are
       ignored (even within multi-line entries).

       Each entry in the file has the following  meaning:  where:
       srvc  specifies  cu,  uucico, or both separated by a colon
       sysfile specifies one or more files to be used as the file
       dialfile  specifies  one  or  more files to be used as the
       file devfile specifies one or more files to be used as the
       file

       Multiple filenames must be separated by colons.  Each file
       is read in the order presented.   The  location  for  each
       file  is  assumed  to be relative to the /etc/uucp/ direc-
       tory, unless a full pathname is given.

       The Sysfiles file may be useful in  the  following  condi-
       tions:  you  want different Systems files so that requests
       for cu services can be made to addresses  other  than  the
       addresses  used  for  uucico  services  you want different
       Dialers files to use different chat  scripts  for  cu  and
       uucico  you  want  to  have  multiple Systems, Dialers and
       Devices files to simplify BNU administration.  The Systems
       file, in particular, may become large, making it desirable
       to split it into several smaller files.

       When different Systems files are defined for uucico and cu
       services,  your  machine will store two different lists of
       systems.  To print the uucico list, use  the  command;  to
       print the cu list, use the uuname -c command.

       The  following  is  an  example  of  a Sysfiles file: ser-
       vice=uucico  systems=Systems.cico:Systems\
                       dialers=Dialers.cico:Dialers\
                       devices=Devices.cico:Devices    service=cu

                                                                1
