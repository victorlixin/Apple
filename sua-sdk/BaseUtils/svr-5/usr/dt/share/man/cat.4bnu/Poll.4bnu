       The  /etc/uucp/Poll file defines remote computers that are
       to be called by your local computer at specified times  of
       the day.

       Each Poll file entry consists of two tab-separated fields:
       sys_namehour[hour...]  where sys_name specifies  the  name
       of  the  remote  computer to be called, and hour specifies
       the time of day that the call is to be made.

       The uudemon.poll script  does  not  actually  perform  the
       poll:  it merely sets up a polling work file (always named
       C.file) in the spool directory.  The  uudemon.hour  script
       starts  the scheduler.  uusched examines all work files in
       the spool directory and performs the polling.

       The  system-supplied  Poll  file  only   contains   sample
       entries.   Unless  polling  is  required, the file usually
       does not need to be modified.
