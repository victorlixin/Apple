       The  /etc/publickey  file  is the public key database used
       for secure RPC.

FFiilleess
       Corresponding NIS map containing public and secret keys.

UUssaaggee
       Each entry in the database consists of a network user name
       (which may either refer to a user or a hostname), followed
       by the user's public key (in hex notation), a  colon,  and
       then the user's secret key encrypted with a password (also
       in hex notation).

       If the network user name is + (plus sign) and the  Network
       Information  Service  (NIS)  is installed and running, the
       NIS map publickey.byname on the NIS server  will  be  used
       instead of /etc/publickey.

       The  publickey file is modified either by the user through
       the command, or by the system administrator using the com-
       mand.
