       The /etc/uucp/Dialers file specifies the initial conversa-
       tion that must take place on a line before the line can be
       made  available  for transferring data.  This conversation
       usually consists of a sequence of character strings to  be
       transmitted and expected.  The character strings are typi-
       cally used to dial a telephone number using  an  Automatic
       Call Unit (ACU) dial modem.

       The  fifth  and subsequent odd-numbered fields in the file
       are indexes into the Dialers file,  or  into  an  internal
       list  of special dialer types (CS, 801, TLI, or TLIS).  If
       a match is found, the Dialers entry is interpreted to per-
       form the dialer conversation.

       Each  entry  in the Dialers file consists of the following
       fields: #dialer substitutions expect-send...  Blank lines,
       and  lines  that  begin with white space, a tab, or a hash
       sign (#) are ignored.

       The fields in the Dialers file  are  defined  as  follows:
       This  field  matches the fifth and subsequent odd numbered
       fields  in  the  Devices  file.   Supplies  a  translation
       string,  where  the  first  of  each pair of characters is
       mapped to the second character in the pair.  This field is
       usually used to translate = and - into whatever the dialer
       requires for wait for dial tone and pause.  Contains char-
       acter  strings  that  make up the chat script used to dial
       the device.

       The following escape characters can be used  in  the  chat
       script: send or expect a backspace character if at the end
       of a string, suppress the newline that is  normally  sent;
       ignored  otherwise  delay  two  seconds  before sending or
       reading more characters pause for approximately 1/4 to 1/2
       second start echo checking (from this point on, whenever a
       character is transmitted, it will wait for  the  character
       to  be received before doing anything else) echo check off
       turn on CLOCAL flag turn off CLOCAL flag  send  a  newline
       character  send or expect a carriage-return send or expect
       a space character send or expect a tab character  send  or
       expect  a  \  character  send  or expect a BREAK character
       telephone number or token  without  Dialcodes  translation
       send  or  expect  EOT  newline twice same as BREAK send or
       expect a null character (ASCII NUL)  telephone  number  or
       token with Dialcodes translation collapse the octal digits
       ddd into a single character specify the timeout by append-
       ing  nn to the expect string, where nn is the timeout time
       in seconds (this will override the  default  value  of  45
       seconds,  or  the  device-specific  value  provided in the
       file)

                                                                1

       The keyword ABORT may be used in an expect field to  indi-
       cate  that the chat script should fail upon receipt of the
       string specified in the send field, without waiting for  a
       timeout.   This  may save time when used to handle strings
       like BUSY returned from dialing devices.

       The Dialers file works closely with the and  files.   Note
       that a change to an entry in one file may require a change
       to a related entry in another file.

       This example uses the system-supplied Dialers  file  entry
       for  the  att2212c  device  shown  here:  att2212C =+-, ""
       atzod,o12=y,o4=n\r\c \006 atT\T\r\c ed As is the case with
       most Dialers file entries, the att2212c entry is processed
       in two steps: The telephone number argument is  translated
       as follows: any equals sign (=) is replaced by a plus sign
       (+) any minus sign (-) is replaced by a comma (,)

       The plus sign and comma in the translated telephone number
       argument  have  the following meanings: wait for dial tone
       pause The handshake given by the remainder of the line  is
       interpreted as follows: wait for nothing; that is, proceed
       to the expect-send string enter command mode, reset modem,
       set  options  to  default  set option 12 to y (transparent
       data mode) set option 4 to n (don't disconnect on received
       spaces);  terminate  with a carriage return but no newline
       wait for acknowledge signal (ACK).   enter  command  mode;
       use tone dialing; translate the phone number and terminate
       with a carriage return, but no newline expect  ed  (as  in
       the last two letters of answered)
