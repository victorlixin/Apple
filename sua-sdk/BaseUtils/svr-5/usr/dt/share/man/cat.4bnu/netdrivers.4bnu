       The /etc/confnet.d/netdrivers file contains a list of net-
       work interfaces installed on the system and the  protocols
       mapped to each interface.

       Each  entry  in  the file consists of two whitespace-sepa-
       rated fields.  device is the name of the  device  file  in
       /dev  that corresponds to the network interface and proto-
       col is the name of the directory in  /etc/confnet.d  where
       the configuration files for the protocol can be found.

       Multiple lines will exist for any board that is being used
       for multiple protocols.

       Lines starting with a # are comments and will be  ignored.

       The  netdrivers  file  and  related  definition  files  in
       /etc/confnet.d/protocol  and  /usr/lib/netcfg/info  should
       only  be altered using the command (the Network Configura-
       tion Manager).
