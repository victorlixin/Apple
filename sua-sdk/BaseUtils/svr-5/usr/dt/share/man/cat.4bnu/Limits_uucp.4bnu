DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       The  /etc/uucp/Limits  file establishes the maximum number
       of file transport daemons, remote command request daemons,
       and  file  transport  scheduler  daemons  permitted to run
       simultaneously on your machine.

       The format of each  line  of  the  Limits  file  is:  ser-
       vice=daemon  max=num where daemon can be uucico, uuxqt, or
       uusched, and num is the maximum number of running  daemons
       permitted for that service.

       The Limits file fields are case-sensitive and order-insen-
       sitive.

       If the Limits file does not exist, or is unreadable, or if
       num  does not specify a positive number, then an unlimited
       number of services  will  be  permitted  to  run  on  your
       machine.

       If you want to change the contents of the Limits file, use
       one of the available text editors.

       The  following  sample  Limits  file  is   typical:   ser-
       vice=uucico   max=5  service=uuxqt  max=2  service=uusched
       max=2 This example allows five uucicos,  two  uuxqts,  and
       two uuscheds to run simultaneously.
