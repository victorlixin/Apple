       The  network configuration database system file, /etc/net-
       config, stores information about networks  that  are  con-
       nected  to  the system and that are available for use.  At
       system startup, (invoked by init) reads /etc/netconfig  to
       initialize the in-kernel socket system's mapping of socket
       families, types and protocols to device files.

       The netconfig database and the  routines  that  access  it
       (see  are  part  of  the Network Selection component.  The
       Network Selection component also includes the  environment
       variable  NETPATH  and a group of routines that access the
       netconfig database using NETPATH components  as  links  to
       the  netconfig  entries.  NETPATH is described in the NET-
       PATH access routines are discussed in

       netconfig contains an entry for each network available  on
       the  system.   Entries  are separated by newlines.  Fields
       are separated by whitespace and  occur  in  the  order  in
       which  they are described below.  Whitespace can be embed-
       ded by escaping an ASCII space or  tab  with  a  backslash
       character  (\).  Backslashes may be embedded as \\.  Lines
       that begin with a hash sign (#) are  treated  as  comments
       and ignored.

       Each  field  in  the network configuration database corre-
       sponds to an element in the netconfig structure.   netcon-
       fig  and the identifiers described on this manual page are
       defined in /usr/include/netconfig.h.   A  string  used  to
       uniquely  identify a network.  The string consists of non-
       null characters, and has a length of at least 1.  No maxi-
       mum  length  is specified.  This namespace is locally sig-
       nificant and the local system administrator is the  naming
       authority.   Note that all network IDs on a system must be
       unique.  A string identifying the semantics of the network
       (that  is, the set of services it supports) by identifying
       the service interface it provides.  The semantics field is
       mandatory.    The   following  semantics  are  recognized.
       Transport  Provider  Interface,  connectionless  Transport
       Provider Interface, connection oriented Transport Provider
       Interface, connection oriented, supports orderly  release.
       Transport  Provider Interface, raw This field records cer-
       tain boolean attributes  of  networks.   flag  contains  a
       string  composed  of  a combination of characters, each of
       which indicates the value of the corresponding  attribute.
       If  the  character  is present, the attribute is true.  If
       the character is absent, the attribute is false.   A  dash
       (-) indicates that none of the attributes is present.  Two

                                                                1

       characters are  currently  recognized:  Visible  (default)
       network.   Used  when  the environment variable NETPATH is
       unset.  Enable RPC broadcast.   The  network  will  accept
       broadcasts.  If this flag is not set, then broadcasts will
       not be allowed on the network.  The flag must be  set  for
       UDP  networks,  otherwise  some applications which need to
       broadcast will fail.  Note that connection oriented trans-
       ports do not support broadcasts.  The protocol family (see
       also the protocol name field below) is provided for proto-
       col-specific applications.

       The  protocol  family field contains a string that identi-
       fies a protocol family.   This  string  follows  the  same
       rules  as  those for the network ID field.  A dash in this
       field  indicates  that  no  protocol   family   identifier
       applies:  that  is, the network is experimental.  The fol-
       lowing are examples: Loopback (local to host).   Internet-
       work: for example, UDP, TCP ARPANET IMP addresses PUP pro-
       tocols: for example, BSP MIT CHAOS protocols XEROX NS pro-
       tocols NBS protocols European Computer Manufacturers Asso-
       ciation DATAKIT protocols CCITT  protocols:  for  example,

       also  ISO  8802 Umbrella for all families used by OSI (for
       example, protosw lookup) CCITT X.25 in  particular  AFI  =
       47,  IDI  =  4 U.S. Government OSI The protocol name field
       contains a string that identifies a protocol.  This string
       follows  the same rules as those for the network ID field.
       The following protocol names are recognized.  A dash indi-
       cates  that none of the names listed below applies: Trans-
       mission Control Protocol User Datagram  Protocol  Internet
       Control  Message  Protocol  The network device is the full
       pathname of the device used to connect  to  the  transport
       provider.   Typically,  this  device  will  be in the /dev
       directory.   This  field  must  have  an   entry.    These
       libraries support a directory service (that is, a name-to-
       address mapping service) for the network.  This service is
       implemented  by the name-to-address mapping feature.  If a
       network is not provided with such a library,  the  feature
       will not work.  A dash in this field indicates the absence
       of any lookup libraries,  in  which  case  name-to-address
       mapping  for  the  network  is non-functional.  This field
       consists of a comma-separated list of  full  pathnames  to
       dynamically  linked  libraries.  Commas may be embedded as
       \,; backslashes as \\.

       nc_semantics  variable  takes the following values, corre-
       sponding to the semantics identified above:

       The nc_flag variable is a bitfield.  The  NC_VISIBLE  bit,
       corresponding  to  the attribute identified above, is cur-
       rently recognized.  NC_NOFLAG indicates the absence of any
       attributes.
