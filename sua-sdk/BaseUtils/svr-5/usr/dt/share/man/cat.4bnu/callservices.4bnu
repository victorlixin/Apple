       The  /etc/ics/Callservices file contains information about
       which services can be used by an incoming call.

       All entries must contain the following five fields in  the
       order  shown.   If  a field is to be left blank, then that
       field must contain a dash (-).   Blank  lines,  and  lines
       that begin with white space, a tab, or a hash sign (#) are
       ignored.

       The fields in the Callservices file are defined, in order,
       as  follows:  This  can  be  one of: modem (Automatic Call
       Unit) modem in fax mode direct serial link to another com-
       puter  or switch ISDN adapter in V120 mode ISDN adapter in
       fax mode ISDN adapter in synchronous mode ISDN adapter  in
       video mode ISDN adapter in voice mode
        local  area  network (LAN) The telephone number that will
       accept the call for the service.  Any specifies any  tele-
       phone  number.   &gemini; does not support the facility to
       obtain the called ID for modems.  Specify Any as the ID of
       such  devices.   The  pathname  of the device on which the
       call was received.  Any specifies any port.  The  pathname
       of the service to invoke.

       isdn_voice  Any  Any  NULL  isdn_video Any Any NULL In the
       above example, a call type of isdn_sync  invokes  the  PPP
       shell  service,  /usr/bin/pppsh.   If the type is acu then
       the service to be invoked is /usr/bin/shserv. If the  call
       type is any of acu_fax, isdn_fax, isdn_voice or isdn_video
       then there is currently no support in &geminiREL; to  han-
       dle  such  requests,  so  the service is set to NULL. If a
       third party application were to become available  to  deal
       with  any  of  these,  then  the  Callservices file can be
       updated on the installed system.
