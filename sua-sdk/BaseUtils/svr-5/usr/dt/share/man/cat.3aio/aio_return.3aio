       aio_return  returns  the return status associated with the
       aiocb structure referenced by the  aiocbp  argument.   The
       return  status  for  an  asynchronous I/O operation is the
       value that would be returned by  the  corresponding  read,
       write,  or  fsync function call.  If the error status (see
       for the operation is equal to EINPROGRESS, the return sta-
       tus for the operation is undefined.  ENOMEM is returned if
       there were no internal kernal aio control blocks available
       to  service  the  request  (number  of  kernel aio control
       blocks is tunable via the NUMAIO kernel parameter; see

       The aio_return function may  be  called  exactly  once  to
       retrieve  the return status of a given asynchronous opera-
       tion; thereafter, if the same aiocb  referenced  structure
       is used in a call to aio_return or aio_error, an error may
       be returned.  When the  aiocb  structure  referred  to  by
       aiocbp  is  used to submit another asynchronous operation,
       aio_return may be successfully used to retrieve the return
       status for that operation.

       The   corresponding   read,  write,  or  fsync  status  is
       returned.  If the asynchronous I/O is  not  yet  complete,
       EINPROGRESS is returned.

       aio_return64  supports large files, but is otherwise iden-
       tical to aio_return.  For details on programming for large
       file capable applications, see on intro(2).
