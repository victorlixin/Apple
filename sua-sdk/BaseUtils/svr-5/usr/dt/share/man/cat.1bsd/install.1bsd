       Install is used within makefiles to copy new versions of
       files into a destination directory and to create the des-
       tination directory itself.

       The first two forms are similar to the command with the
       addition that executable files can be stripped during the
       copy and the owner, group, and mode of the installed
       file(s) can be given.

       The third form can be used to create a destination direc-
       tory with the required owner, group and permissions.

       Set the group ownership of the installed file or direc-
       tory.  (staff by default) Set the mode for the installed
       file or directory.  (0755 by default) If run as root, set
       the ownership of the installed file to the user-ID of
       owner.  Copy files.  In fact install always copies files,
       but the -c option is retained for backwards compatibility
       with old shell scripts that might otherwise break.  Strip
       executable files as they are copied.  Create a directory.
       Missing parent directories are created as required as in
       mkdir -p.  If the directory already exists, the owner,
       group and mode will be set to the values given on the com-
       mand line.

       install uses no special privileges to copy files from one
       place to another.  The implications of this are: You must
       have permission to read the files to be installed.  You
       must have permission to copy into the destination file or
       directory.  You must have permission to change the modes
       on the final copy of the file if you want to use the -m
       option to change modes.  You must be superuser if you want
       to specify the ownership of the installed file with -o.
       If you are not the super-user, or if -o is not in effect,
       the installed file will be owned by you, regardless of who
       owns the original.
