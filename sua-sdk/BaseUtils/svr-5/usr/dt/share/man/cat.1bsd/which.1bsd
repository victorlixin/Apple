       which  takes a list of names and looks for the files which
       would be executed had these names been given as  commands.
       Each  argument  is expanded if it is aliased, and searched
       for along the user's path.   Both  aliases  and  path  are
       taken from the user's .cshrc file.

       A  diagnostic is given for names which are aliased to more
       than a single word, or if  an  executable  file  with  the
       argument name was not found in the path.

       Only  aliases  and paths from ~/.cshrc are used; importing
       from the current environment is not attempted.

       which must be executed  by  since  only  csh  knows  about
       aliases.   If  you  are using sh instead of csh, whence -v
       provides similar functionality.

       To compensate for ~/.cshrc files in which  aliases  depend
       upon  the prompt variable being set, which sets this vari-
       able.  If the ~/.cshrc  produces  output  or  prompts  for
       input  when  prompt is set, which may produce some strange
       results.
