       The checknr command checks a list of nroff or troff  input
       files  for  certain  kinds  of errors involving mismatched
       opening and closing delimiters and unknown  commands.   If
       no files are specified, checknr checks the standard input.
       Delimiters checked are: Font changes using \fx . . .  \fP.
       Size  changes  using  \sx  . . . \s0.  Macros that come in
       open . . .  close forms, for  example,  the  .TS  and  .TE
       macros which must always come in pairs.

       checknr knows about the ms and me macro packages.

       checknr  is intended to be used on documents that are pre-
       pared with checknr in mind.  It expects a certain document
       writing  style  for  \f  and \s commands, in that each \fx
       must be terminated with \fP and each \sx  must  be  termi-
       nated  with  \s0.   While it will work to directly go into
       the next font or explicitly specify the original  font  or
       point  size, and many existing documents actually do this,
       such a practice  will  produce  complaints  from  checknr.
       Since  it  is probably better to use the \fP and \s0 forms
       anyway, you should think of this as a contribution to your
       document preparation style.

       The  following  options  are  available:  Ignore  \f  font
       changes.  Ignore \s size changes.  Add pairs of macros  to
       the  list.   The  pairs  of macros are assumed to be those
       (such as .DS and that should be checked for balance.   The
       -a  option  must  be followed by groups of six characters,
       each group defining a pair of macros.  The six  characters
       are  a  period,  the first macro name, another period, and
       the second macro name.  For example, to define a pair  .BS
       and  .BE, use -a.BS.BE Define commands which checknr would
       otherwise complain about as undefined.

       There is no way to define a one-character macro name using
       the -a option.
