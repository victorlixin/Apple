       logger provides a method for adding  one-line  entries  to
       the  system  log  file from the command line.  One or more
       message arguments can be given on  the  command  line,  in
       which  case each is logged immediately.  Otherwise, a file
       can be specified, in which case each line in the  file  is
       logged.   If  neither  is specified, logger reads and logs
       messages on a line-by-line basis from the standard  input.

       Mark  each  line  added to the log with the specified tag.
       Enter the message with the specified priority.   The  mes-
       sage priority can be specified numerically, or as a facil-
       ity.level pair.  For example, `-p local3.info' assigns the
       message priority to the info level in the local3 facility.
       The default priority is user.notice.  Log the  process  ID
       of the logger process with each line.  Use the contents of
       file as the message  to  log.   If  this  is  unspecified,
       either the file indicated with -f or the standard input is
       added to the log.

       logger System rebooted

       will log the message `System rebooted' to the facility  at
       priority notice to be treated by syslogd as other messages
       to the facility notice are.  logger  -p  local0.notice  -t
       HOSTIDM -f /dev/idmc

       will  read  from the file /dev/idmc and will log each line
       in that file as a message with the tag HOSTIDM at priority
       notice  to  be treated by syslogd as other messages to the
       facility local0 are.
