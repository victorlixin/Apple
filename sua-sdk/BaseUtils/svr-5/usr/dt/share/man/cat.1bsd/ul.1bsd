       The  ul  command  reads  the  named files (or the standard
       input if none are given)  and  translates  occurrences  of
       underscores  to  the  sequence which indicates underlining
       for the terminal in use, as specified by  the  environment
       variable TERM.  ul uses the /usr/share/lib/termcap file to
       determine the appropriate sequences for  underlining.   If
       the  terminal  is incapable of underlining, but is capable
       of a standout mode then that is used instead.  If the ter-
       minal  can  overstrike,  or  handles underlining automati-
       cally, ul degenerates to  cat.   If  the  terminal  cannot
       underline, underlining is ignored.

       The following options are available: Override the terminal
       kind specified in the environment.  If the terminal cannot
       underline,  underlining  is ignored.  Indicate underlining
       by a separate line containing appropriate dashes  -;  this
       is  useful  when you want to look at the underlining which
       is present in an nroff output stream on a CRT-terminal.
