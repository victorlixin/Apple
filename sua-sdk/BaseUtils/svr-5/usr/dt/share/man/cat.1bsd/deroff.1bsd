       The deroff command reads each file in sequence and removes
       all nroff and troff  command  lines,  backslash  construc-
       tions,  macro definitions, eqn constructs (between .EQ and
       .EN lines or between delimiters), and  table  descriptions
       and  writes  the remainder on the standard output.  deroff
       follows chains of included files (.so and  .nx  commands);
       if  a file has already been included, a .so is ignored and
       a .nx terminates execution.  If no input  file  is  given,
       deroff reads from the standard input file.

   OOppttiioonnss
       When  used  with  -ma,  -me, -ml, -mm, -ms options, the -k
       option will include text blocks  that  would  normally  be
       removed,  such  as those between macros .nf and .fi.  Will
       keep the paragraph notations  included  in  the  text  (.P
       macro).   Generate  a  word  list,  one  word per line.  A
       ``word'' is a string of letters, digits, and  apostrophes,
       beginning  with  a  letter;  apostrophes are removed.  All
       other characters are ignored.

       The -m option may be followed by an a,  e,  l,  m,  or  s.

       deroff is not a complete troff interpreter, so it  can  be
       confused  by subtle constructs.  Most errors result in too
       much rather than too little output.

       deroff does not work well  with  files  that  use  .so  to
       source in the standard macro package files.
