       The  sortbib  command  sorts  files  of records containing
       refer key-letters by user-specified keys.  Records may  be
       separated  by blank lines, or by ``.['' and ``.]''  delim-
       iters, but the two styles may not be mixed together.  This
       program  reads  through  each  database  and pulls out key
       fields, which  are  sorted  separately.   The  sorted  key
       fields  contain  the file pointer, byte offset, and length
       of corresponding records.   These  records  are  delivered
       using  disk seeks and reads, so sortbib may not be used in
       a pipeline to read standard input.

       By default, sortbib alphabetizes by the first %A  and  the
       %D  fields, which contain the senior author and date.  The
       -s option is used to specify new key-letters.  See  addbib
       for  a list of the most common key letters.  For instance,
       -sATD will sort by author, title, and  date,  while  -sA+D
       will  sort  by  all authors, and date.  Sort keys past the
       fourth are not meaningful.  No more than 16 databases  may
       be  sorted together at one time.  Records longer than 4096
       characters will be truncated.

       sortbib sorts on the last word on the %A  line,  which  is
       assumed to be the author's last name.  A word in the final
       position, such as ``jr.''  or ``ed.'', will be ignored  if
       the  name beforehand ends with a comma.  Authors with two-
       word last names or unusual  constructions  can  be  sorted
       correctly by using the nroff convention ``\0'' in place of
       a blank.  A %Q field is considered to be the same  as  %A,
       except  sorting begins with the first, not the last, word.
       sortbib sorts on the last word of the %D line, usually the
       year.   It  also  ignores  leading articles (like ``A'' or
       ``The'') when sorting by titles in the %T or %J fields; it
       will  ignore articles of any modern European language.  If
       a sort-significant field is absent from a record,  sortbib
       places  that  record  before other records containing that
       field.

       Records with missing  author  fields  should  probably  be
       sorted by title.
