       chown  changes the owner of the files to owner.  The owner
       may be either a decimal user ID or a login name  found  in
       /etc/passwd  file.  The optional .group suffix may be used
       to change the group at the same time.

       If chown is invoked by other than the super-user, the set-
       user-ID bit of the file mode, 04000, is cleared.

       Only the super-user may change the owner of a file.

       Valid  options  to  chown are: Suppress error reporting If
       the file is a symbolic link, change the owner of the  sym-
       bolic  link.   Without  this option, the owner of the file
       referenced by  the  symbolic  link  is  changed.   Descend
       recursively  through  directories setting the ownership ID
       of all files in each directory entered.
