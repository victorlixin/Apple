       lptest  writes  the traditional ``ripple test'' pattern on
       standard output.  In 96 lines, this pattern will print all
       96  printable  ASCII  characters  in each position.  While
       originally created to test printers, it  is  quite  useful
       for  testing  terminals, driving terminal ports for debug-
       ging purposes, or any other task where a quick  supply  of
       random data is needed.

       The  length  argument  specifies the output line length if
       the default length of 79 is inappropriate.

       The count argument specifies the number of output lines to
       be generated if the default count of 200 is inappropriate.

NNoottiicceess
       If count is to be specified, length must be also be speci-
       fied.

       This command is obsolescent.
