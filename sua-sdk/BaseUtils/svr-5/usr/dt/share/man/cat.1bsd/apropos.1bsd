       apropos  finds  manual pages that contain any of the given
       keywords in their short descriptions.   apropos  considers
       each word separately and is case-insensitive.  Words which
       are part of other words are matched;  thus,  when  looking
       for compile, apropos also finds all instances of compiler.

       apropos sorts its output alphabetically by command name.

       apropos is equivalent to running with the -k option.

       The system administrator can add local manual pages to the
       keyword database using
