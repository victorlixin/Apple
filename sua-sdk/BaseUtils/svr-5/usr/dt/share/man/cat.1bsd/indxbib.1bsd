       indxbib makes an inverted index to the named database-file
       (which must reside within the  current  directory),  typi-
       cally  for  use by lookbib and refer.  A database contains
       bibliographic references (or other kinds  of  information)
       separated by blank lines.

       A  bibliographic reference is a set of lines, constituting
       fields of bibliographic information.  Each field starts on
       a  line beginning with a %, followed by a key-letter, then
       a blank, and finally the contents of the field, which  may
       continue  until  the  next  line  starting  with  %'  (see
       addbib).

       indxbib is a shell script that calls  two  programs:  mkey
       and  inv.   mkey truncates words to 6 characters, and maps
       upper case to lower case.  It also discards words  shorter
       than 3 characters, words among the 100 most common English
       words, and numbers (dates) < 1900 or > 2000.  These param-
       eters can be changed.

       indxbib creates an entry file (with a .ia suffix), a post-
       ing file (.ib), and a  tag  file  (.ic),  in  the  working
       directory.

       All  dates  should  probably be indexed, since many disci-
       plines refer to literature written in the  1800s  or  ear-
       lier.

       indxbib does not recognize pathnames.
