       /usr/ucb/cc  is  the  C compiler for the BSD Compatibility
       Package.  /usr/ucb/cc is  identical  to  /usr/bin/cc  [see
       except  that BSD header files are used.  BSD libraries are
       linked before System V libraries.

       /usr/ucb/cc accepts the same options as /usr/bin/cc,  with
       the  following  exceptions:  Search dir for included files
       whose names do not begin with a `/', prior  to  the  usual
       directories.  The directories from multiple -I options are
       searched in the order specified.  The  preprocessor  first
       searches  for  #include  files in the directory containing
       sourcefile, and then in directories named with -I  options
       (if   any),   then   /usr/ucbinclude,   and   finally,  in
       /usr/include.  Add dir to the list of directories searched
       for  libraries  by  /usr/bin/cc.  This option is passed to
       /usr/bin/ld.  Directories specified with this  option  are
       searched  before  /usr/ucblib  and  /usr/lib.   Change the
       default directory used for finding libraries.

       The -Y LU,dir option  may  have  unexpected  results,  and
       should  not  be used.  This option is not in the  System V
       base.

       If the -p option to /usr/ucb/cc is being used with the -dn
       and  -lm  options, then this invocation of the /usr/ucb/cc
       command will fail.  This occurs because  /usr/ucb/cc  exe-
       cutes    as    the    following    command:   (/usr/bin/cc
       -YP,:/usr/ucblib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/lib   $@   \         -I
       /usr/ucbinclude -l ucb -l socket -l nsl)

       This  command  requests a search of the library libnsl (-l
       nsl) which is a shared  object,  rather  than  an  archive
       library.  To fix this problem, you must invoke /usr/bin/cc
       directly,  using  the  same  format  as  shown  above  for
       /usr/ucb/cc, but without the -l nsl option.

       An        example        would       be:       /usr/bin/cc
       -YP,:/usr/ucblib:/usr/ccs/lib:/usr/lib -p -dn  \       -lm
       prog.c -I /usr/ucbinclude -l ucb -l socket
