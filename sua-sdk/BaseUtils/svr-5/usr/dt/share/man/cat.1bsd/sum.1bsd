       sum  calculates  and  displays  a  16-bit checksum for the
       named file, and also displays the  size  of  the  file  in
       kilobytes.  It is typically used to look for bad spots, or
       to validate a file  communicated  over  some  transmission
       line.   The  checksum  is calculated by an algorithm which
       may yield different results on machines with  16-bit  ints
       and machines with 32-bit ints, so it cannot always be used
       to validate that  a  file  has  been  transferred  between
       machines with different-sized ints.

       Read  error is indistinguishable from EOF on most devices;
       check the block count.
