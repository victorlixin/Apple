       stty sets certain terminal I/O options for the device that
       is the  current  standard  input;  without  arguments,  it
       reports the settings of certain options.

       In  the  input  and output of stty, if a character is pre-
       ceded by a caret (^), then the value of that option is the
       corresponding  CTRL  character  (for  example,  ``^h''  is
       CTRL-h; in this case, recall that CTRL-h is  the  same  as
       the ``backspace'' key.)  The sequence ``^''' means that an
       option has a null value.  reports all of the  option  set-
       tings.   reports  current  settings  in a form that can be
       used as an argument to another stty command.  reports  all
       the option settings with the control characters in an easy
       to read column format.

       Options in the last group are implemented using options in
       the  previous  groups.   Note  that  many  combinations of
       options make no sense, but  no  sanity  checking  is  per-
       formed.  Hardware flow control and clock modes options may
       not be supported by all hardware interfaces.  The  options
       are selected from the following:

       Reports  the  same  option  settings as stty without argu-
       ments, but with the control characters in  column  format.
       Everything  stty  knows  about  is  printed.   Same  as -h
       option.  The terminal speed alone is reported on the stan-
       dard  output.   The terminal (window) sizes are printed on
       the standard output, first rows and  then  columns.   This
       option  is  only appropriate if currently running a window
       system.

       size and speed always report on the settings of  /dev/tty,
       and always report the settings to the standard output.
