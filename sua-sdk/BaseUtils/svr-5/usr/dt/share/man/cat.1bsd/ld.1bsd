       /usr/ucb/ld  is  the link editor for the BSD Compatibility
       Package.  /usr/ucb/ld is  identical  to  /usr/bin/ld  [see
       except that BSD libraries and routines are included before
       System V libraries and routines.

       /usr/ucb/ld accepts the same options as /usr/bin/ld,  with
       the  following exceptions: Add dir to the list of directo-
       ries searched for libraries by  /usr/bin/ld.   Directories
       specified with this option are searched before /usr/ucblib
       and /usr/lib.  Change the default directory used for find-
       ing  libraries.   Warning: this option may have unexpected
       results, and should not be used.
