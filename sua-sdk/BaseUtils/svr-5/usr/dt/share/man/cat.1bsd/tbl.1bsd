       The  tbl  command  is a preprocessor for formatting tables
       for nroff or troff.  The input files  are  copied  to  the
       standard  output,  except  that  lines between .TS and .TE
       command lines are  assumed  to  describe  tables  and  are
       reformatted.

       If  no  arguments are given, tbl reads the standard input,
       so tbl may be used as a filter.  When tbl is used with eqn
       or  neqn  the tbl command should be first, to minimize the
       volume of data passed through pipes.  This  option  copies
       the  -me  macro  package  to the front of the output file.
       This option copies the -ms macro package to the  front  of
       the  output  file.   This option produces output that does
       not have fractional line motions in it.

       The following options must be placed immediately after the
       .TS  line.   Each option must be separated by a space, tab
       or comma and must end with a semicolon.  centers the table

       The format section of the table specifies  the  layout  of
       the  columns.  Each line in the format section corresponds
       to one line of table data except the last line, which cor-
       responds to all succeeding data lines.  Each line contains
       a key-letter for each column of  the  table.   A  dot  (.)
       indicates the end of key letters.

       Data entries are usually separated by  tabs,  but  in  the
       following examples, a colon (:) is used as the tab charac-
       ter.
