       lprm removes a job  or  jobs  from  a  printer's  spooling
       queue.  Since the spool directory is protected from users,
       using lprm is normally the only method by which a user can
       remove a job.

       Without  any  arguments, lprm deletes the job that is cur-
       rently active, provided that the  user  who  invoked  lprm
       owns that job.

       When  the  privileged  user  specifies  a  username,  lprm
       removes all jobs belonging to that user.

       You can remove a specific job by supplying its job  number
       as  an  argument,  which you can obtain using For example:
       lpq  -Phost host is ready and printing Rank          Owner
       Job      Files            Total  Size  active        wendy
       385     standard input  35501 bytes lprm -Phost 385

       lprm reports the names of any files  it  removes,  and  is
       silent if there are no applicable jobs to remove.

       lprm  Sends  the  request  to  cancel  a  job to the print
       spooler, LPSCHED.

       Specify the queue  associated  with  a  specific  printer.
       Otherwise  the  value of the PRINTER variable in the envi-
       ronment is used.  If this variable is unset, the queue for
       the  default  printer  is  used.  Remove all jobs owned by
       you.  If invoked by the privileged user, all jobs  in  the
       spool  are  removed.   Job  ownership is determined by the
       user's login name and host name on the machine  where  the
       lpr command was executed.

       The  printer  was  not  found in the System V LP database.
       Usually this is a typing mistake; however, it may indicate
       that  the  printer  does  not  exist  on  the system.  Use
       `lpstat -p' to get the status of printers.  The connection
       to  lpsched  on  the  local  machine failed.  This usually
       means the printer server started at boot time has died  or
       is   hung.    Check   if   the   printer   spooler  daemon
       /usr/lib/lp/lpsched is running.  These indicate  that  the
       LP print service has been stopped.  Get help from the sys-
       tem administrator.  It is likely there is an error in this
       software.   Get  help  from system administrator.  You are

       An active job may be incorrectly identified for removal by
       an  lprm  command  issued  with  no arguments.  During the
       interval between an command and the execution of lprm, the
       next  job in queue may have become active; that job may be
       removed unintentionally if it is owned by you.   To  avoid
       this,  supply  lprm  with  the job number to remove when a
       critical job that you own is next in line.

       Only the privileged user can remove print  jobs  submitted
       from another host.
