       refer is a preprocessor for or that finds and formats ref-
       erences.   The input files (standard input by default) are
       copied to the standard output, except  for  lines  between
       `.['  and  `.]'  command lines.  Such lines are assumed to
       contain keywords as for and are  replaced  by  information
       from  a  bibliographic  data base.  The user can avoid the
       search, override fields from it, or add new  fields.   The
       reference data, from whatever source, is assigned to a set
       of troff strings.  Macro packages such as print  the  fin-
       ished reference text from these strings.  A flag is placed
       in the text at the point of reference.   By  default,  the
       references are indicated by numbers.

       When  refer  is  used  with  neqn, or refer should be used
       first in the sequence, to  minimize  the  volume  of  data
       passed through pipes.

       The  following  options are available: Bare mode -- do not
       put any flags in text (neither numbers or labels).   Accu-
       mulate  references instead of leaving the references where
       encountered,  until  a  sequence  of  the  form:        .[
            $LIST$      .]

       is  encountered,  and  then  write out all references col-
       lected so far.  Collapse references to  the  same  source.
       Do  not  search  the  default  file.   Reverse the first r
       author names (Jones, J. A. instead of J. A. Jones).  If  r
       is  omitted,  all  author  names are reversed.  Capitalize
       (with SMALL CAPS) the  fields  whose  key-letters  are  in
       string.   Instead  of numbering references, use key labels
       as specified in a reference data line beginning  with  the
       characters %x; By default, %x is %L.  Instead of numbering
       references, use labels from the senior author's last  name
       and  the year of publication.  Only the first m letters of
       the last name and the last n digits of the date are  used.
       If  either  of m or n is omitted, the entire name or date,
       respectively, is used.  Take the next argument as  a  file
       of  references  to  be  searched.   The  default  file  is
       searched last.  Sort references by fields  whose  key-let-
       ters are in the keys string, and permute reference numbers
       in the text accordingly.  Using this option implies the -e
       option.  The key-letters in keys may be followed by a num-
       ber indicating how many such fields are  used,  with  a  +
       sign  taken  as  a  very large number.  The default is AD,
       which sorts on the senior author and date.  To sort on all
       authors  and then the title, for instance, use the options
       `-sA+T'.
