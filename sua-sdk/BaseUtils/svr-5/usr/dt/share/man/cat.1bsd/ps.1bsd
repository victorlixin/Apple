       The ps command displays information about processes.  Nor-
       mally, only those processes that  are  running  with  your
       effective user ID and are attached to a controlling termi-
       nal (see are shown.  Additional  categories  of  processes
       can  be  added  to  the display using various options.  In
       particular, the -a option allows you to include  processes
       that are not owned by you (that do not have your user ID),
       and the -x option allows you to include processes  without
       control  terminals.   When you specify both -a and -x, you
       get processes owned by anyone, with or without  a  control
       terminal.   The  -r option restricts the list of processes
       printed to running and runnable processes.

       ps displays the process ID, under PID; the control  termi-
       nal  (if  any), under TT; the cpu time used by the process
       so far, including both user and system time,  under  TIME;
       the state of the process, under S; and finally, an indica-
       tion of the COMMAND that is running.

       The state is given by a single letter from the  following:
       Process  is running on a processor.  Sleeping.  Process is
       waiting for an event to complete.  Runnable.   Process  is
       on  run  queue.   Idle.  Process is being created.  Zombie
       state.   Process  terminated  and  parent   not   waiting.
       Traced.   Process  stopped  by  a signal because parent is
       tracing it.  SXBRK state.  Process  is  waiting  for  more
       primary memory.

       The  following  options  must  all be combined to form the
       first argument: Include information about processes  owned
       by others.  Display the command name, as stored internally
       in the system for purposes of accounting, rather than  the
       command  arguments, which are kept in the process' address
       space.  This is more reliable, if less informative,  since
       the  process  is  free  to destroy the latter information.
       Display all  processes.   Without  this  option,  ps  only
       prints  interesting processes.  Processes are deemed to be
       uninteresting if they are  process  group  leaders.   This
       normally  eliminates  top-level  command  interpreters and
       processes waiting for users to login  on  free  terminals.
       Display  a long listing, with fields F, PPID, CP, PRI, NI,
       SZ, RSS and WCHAN as described below.   Produce  numerical
       output for some fields.  In a user listing, the USER field
       is replaced by a UID field.  Restrict  output  to  running
       and runnable processes.  Display accumulated CPU time used
       by this process and all of its reaped  children.   Display
       user-oriented  output.  This includes fields USER, SZ, RSS
       and START as described below.  Update the private database
       (/etc/ps_data)  where  ps  keeps system information.  This
       option may be used solely by privileged users.  Display  a

       version  of  the  output  containing virtual memory.  This
       includes fields SIZE and RSS, described below.  Use a wide
       output  format  (132 columns rather than 80); if repeated,
       that is, -ww, use arbitrarily wide output.  This  informa-
       tion is used to decide how much of long commands to print.
       Include processes with no controlling terminal.  List only
       process data associated with the terminal, term.  Terminal
       identifiers may be specified in  one  of  two  forms:  the
       device's  file name (for example, tty04 or term/14) or, if
       the device's file name starts with  tty,  just  the  digit
       identifier  (for  example,  04).   A process number may be
       given, in which case the output is restricted to that pro-
       cess.  This option must be supplied last.

       Fields  that are not common to all output formats: Name of
       the owner of the process.   Process  scheduling  increment
       [see  and The combined size of the data and stack segments
       (in kilobyte units) Real memory (resident set) size of the
       process (in kilobyte units).  Numerical user-ID of process
       owner.  Numerical ID of parent of process.  Short-term CPU
       utilization  factor (used in scheduling).  The priority of
       the process (higher numbers  mean  lower  priority).   The
       starting time of the process, given in hours, minutes, and
       seconds.  A process begun more than 24 hours before the ps
       inquiry  is  executed  is  given  in months and days.  The
       address of an event for which the process is sleeping,  or
       in  SXBRK state (if blank, the process is running).  Flags
       (hexadecimal and additive) associated  with  the  process:
       Process  has  terminated.  Process table now available.  A
       system process, always in primary memory.  Parent is trac-
       ing process.  Tracing parent's signal has stopped process.
       Parent is waiting, see Process  is  currently  in  primary
       memory.  Process currently in primary memory, locked until
       an event is completed.

       A process that has exited and has a parent,  but  has  not
       yet  been  waited  for  by the parent is marked <defunct>;
       otherwise, ps tries to  determine  the  command  name  and
       arguments  given when the process was created by examining
       the user block.

       Things  can  change  while  ps  is running; the picture it
       gives is only a close approximation to the current  state.
       Some data printed for defunct processes is irrelevant.

       If  no  term  or  num is specified, ps checks the standard
       input, the standard output, and the standard error in that

       attempt to report on processes associated  with  the  con-
       trolling  terminal.   In  this  situation, if the standard
       input, the standard output, and the standard error are all
       redirected,  ps  will  not find a controlling terminal, so
       there will be no report.
