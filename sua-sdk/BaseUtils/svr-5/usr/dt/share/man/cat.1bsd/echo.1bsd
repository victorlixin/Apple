       The  echo  command  is useful for producing diagnostics in
       command files and for sending known data into a pipe.  The
       command  writes its arguments separated by blanks and ter-
       minated by a new-line on the standard output.

       The -n option is used when the termination by  a  new-line
       is not wanted.
