       test  evaluates  the  expression expr and, if its value is
       true, sets a zero (true) exit status;  otherwise,  a  non-
       zero (false) exit status is set; test also sets a non-zero
       exit status if there are no arguments.   When  permissions
       are  tested, the effective user ID of the process is used.

       All operators, flags, and brackets (brackets used as shown
       in the second SYNOPSIS line) must be separate arguments to
       the test command; normally these items  are  separated  by
       spaces.

       The  following primitives are used to construct expr: true
       if file exists and is readable.  true if file  exists  and
       is writable.  true if file exists and is executable.  true
       if file exists and is a regular file.   Alternatively,  if
       /usr/bin/sh  users  specify  /usr/ucb  before  /usr/bin in
       their PATH environment variable,  then  test  will  return
       true  if  file  exists  and is (not-a-directory).  This is
       also the default for /usr/bin/csh  users.   true  if  file
       exists  and  is a directory.  true if file exists and is a
       character special file.  true if  file  exists  and  is  a
       block  special  file.   true if file exists and is a named
       pipe (fifo).  true if file exists and its set-user-ID  bit
       is  set.   true if file exists and its set-group-ID bit is
       set.  true if file exists and its sticky bit is set.  true
       if  file exists and has a size greater than zero.  true if
       the open file whose file descriptor number is fildes (1 by
       default)  is  associated  with a terminal device.  true if
       the length of string s1 is zero.  true if  the  length  of
       the  string s1 is non-zero.  true if strings s1 and s2 are
       identical.  true if strings s1 and s2 are  not  identical.
       true  if  s1 is not the null string.  true if the integers
       n1 and n2 are algebraically equal.  Any of the comparisons
       -ne,  -gt,  -ge, -lt, and -le may be used in place of -eq.
       true if file exists and is a symbolic link. With all other
       primitives, the symbolic links are followed by default.

       These  primaries may be combined with the following opera-
       tors:  unary  negation  operator.   binary  and  operator.
       binary  or  operator  (-a  has higher precedence than -o).
       parentheses for grouping.  Notice  also  that  parentheses
       are  meaningful  to  the  shell  and,  therefore,  must be
       quoted.

       supported in future releases.

       The -L option is a migration aid for users of other shells
       which  have  similar  options  and may not be supported in
       future releases.

       If you test a file you own (the -r, -w, or -x tests),  but
       the  permission  tested does not have the owner bit set, a
       non-zero (false) exit status will be returned even  though
       the file may have the group or other bit set for that per-
       mission.  The correct exit status will be set if  you  are
       super-user.

       The  =  and != operators have a higher precedence than the
       -r through -n operators, and = and != always expect  argu-
       ments;  therefore,  =  and  !=  cannot be used with the -r
       through -n operators.

       If more than one argument follows the -r through -n opera-
       tors,  only the first argument is examined; the others are
       ignored, unless a -a or a -o is the second argument.
