       tr  copies  the standard input to the standard output with
       substitution or  deletion  of  selected  characters.   The
       arguments string1 and string2 are considered sets of char-
       acters.  Any input character found in  string1  is  mapped
       into  the  character  in the corresponding position within
       string2.  When string2 is  short,  it  is  padded  to  the
       length of string1 by duplicating its last character.

       In either string the notation a-b denotes a range of char-
       acters from a to b in increasing ASCII order.  The charac-
       ter  \,  followed by 1, 2 or 3 octal digits stands for the
       character whose ASCII code is given by those  digits.   As
       with  the  shell,  the escape character \, followed by any
       other character, escapes  any  special  meaning  for  that
       character.

       Any  combination of the options -c, -d, or -s may be used:
       Complement the set of characters in string1  with  respect
       to  the  universe  of  characters whose ASCII codes are 01
       through  0377  octal.   Delete  all  input  characters  in
       string1.   Squeeze  all strings of repeated output charac-
       ters that are in string2 to single characters.

       The following example creates a list of all the  words  in
       filename1 one per line in filename2, where a word is taken
       to be a maximal string of alphabetics.  The second  string
       is quoted to protect `\' from the shell.  012 is the ASCII
       code for NEWLINE.  tr -cs A-Za-z  '\012'  <filename1>file-
       name2

       Will not handle ASCIINUL in string1 or string2.  tr always
       deletes NUL from input.
