       nroff formats text in the named file  for  typewriter-like
       devices.  [See also

       If  no  file argument is present, nroff reads the standard
       input.  An argument consisting of a `-' is taken to  be  a
       file name corresponding to the standard input.

       The  following  options  may appear in any order, but must
       appear before the files.  Produce equally-spaced words  in
       adjusted  lines, using full terminal resolution.  Use out-
       put TAB characters during horizontal spacing to speed out-
       put  and  reduce output character count.  TAB settings are
       assumed to be every 8 nominal character widths.  Read  the
       standard  input  after  the  input  files  are  exhausted.
       Invoke  the  simultaneous  input-output  mode  of  the  rd
       request.   Search directory dir for font tables instead of
       the system-dependent  default.   Prepend  the  macro  file
       /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/name to the input files.  Number
       first generated page N.  Print only pages whose page  num-
       bers  appear  in  the  comma-separated list of numbers and
       ranges.  A range N-M means pages N through M;  an  initial
       -N  means  from  the  beginning  to page N; and a final N-
       means from N to the end.  Set register  a  (one-character)
       to N.  Stop every N pages.  nroff will halt prior to every
       N pages (default N=1) to allow paper loading or  changing,
       and will resume upon receipt of a NEWLINE.  Prepare output
       for a device of the  specified  name.   Known  names  are:
       Teletype  Corporation  Model  37  terminal  -- this is the
       default.  GE TermiNet 300, or any line printer or terminal
       without  half-line  capability.   DASI-300.   DASI-300  --
       12-pitch.  DASI-300S.   DASI-300S.   DASI-382  (fancy  DTC
       382).  DASI-450 (Diablo Hyterm).  DASI-450 (Diablo Hyterm)
       -- 12-pitch.  AJ 832.  Set emboldening factor for the font
       mounted  on  position 3 to N.  Emboldening is accomplished
       by overstriking the specified number of  times.   Suppress
       formatted  output.   The only output will consist of diag-
       nostic messages from nroff and messages  output  with  the
       .tm request.
