       With no arguments, groups displays the groups to which you
       belong; otherwise it displays the groups to which the user
       belongs.   Each  user  belongs to a group specified in the
       password file /etc/passwd and possibly to other groups  as
       specified  in  the  file  /etc/group.  If you do not own a
       file but belong to the group by which it is owned, you are
       granted group access to the file.
