       The  w  command displays a summary of the current activity
       on the system, including what each  user  is  doing.   The
       heading  line  shows the current time of day, how long the
       system has been up, and the number of  users  logged  into
       the system.

       The  fields  displayed are: the users login name, the name
       of the tty the user is on, the time of day the user logged
       on  (in hours:minutes), the idle time--that is, the number
       of  minutes  since  the  user  last  typed  anything   (in
       hours:minutes),  the  CPU  time  used by all processes and
       their children on that terminal (in minutes:seconds),  the
       CPU  time  used by the currently active processes (in min-
       utes:seconds), the name and arguments of the current  pro-
       cess.

       If  a  user name is included, output is restricted to that
       user.

       The following options are available: Suppress the heading.
       Produce a long form of output, which is the default.  Pro-
       duce a short form of output.  In the short form,  the  tty
       is abbreviated, the login time and CPU times are left off,
       as are the arguments to commands.

       Executing w with no options produces output similar to the
       following:  7:36am   up 6 days, 16:45,  1 user User    tty

       The  notion of the ``current process'' is muddy.  The cur-
       rent algorithm is `the highest  numbered  process  on  the
       terminal  that is not ignoring interrupts, or, if there is
       none, the highest numbered process on the terminal'.  This
       fails,  for example, in critical sections of programs like
       the shell and editor, or when faulty programs  running  in
       the  background  fork  and  fail to ignore interrupts.  In
       cases where no process can be found, w prints -.

       The CPU time is only an estimate, in particular, if  some-
       one leaves a background process running after logging out,
       the person currently on that terminal is ``charged''  with
       the time.

       Background  processes  are  not  shown,  even  though they
       account for much of the load on the system.

       Sometimes processes, typically those  in  the  background,
       are  printed  with  null  or garbaged arguments.  In these
       cases, the name of the command is printed in  parentheses.

       w  does not know about the conventions for detecting back-
       ground jobs.  It will  sometimes  find  a  background  job
       instead of the right one.

       Unlike  other BSD versions of this command, the load aver-
       ages are not computed or displayed.
