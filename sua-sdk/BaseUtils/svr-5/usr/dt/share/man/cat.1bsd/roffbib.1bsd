       The roffbib command prints out all records in a biblio-
       graphic database, in bibliography format rather than as
       footnotes or endnotes.  Generally it is used in conjunc-
       tion with example% sortbib  database | roffbib

       If abstracts or comments are entered following the %X
       field key, roffbib will format them into paragraphs for an
       annotated bibliography.  Several %X fields may be given if
       several annotation paragraphs are desired.

       roffbib accepts most options understood by as well as oth-
       ers defined below: Produce equally-spaced words in
       adjusted lines using full terminal resolution.  Use output
       tabs during horizontal spacing to speed output and reduce
       output character count.  TAB settings are assumed to be
       every 8 nominal character widths.  Queue output for the
       phototypesetter.  Page offset is set to 1 inch.  Suppress
       printing of abstracts.  Prepend the macro file
       /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/name to the input files.  There
       should be a space between the -m and the macro filename.
       This set of macros will replace the ones defined in
       /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/bib.  Number first generated
       page p.  Print only page numbers that appear in the comma-
       separated list of numbers and ranges.  A range N-M means
       pages N through M; an initial -N means from the beginning
       to page N; a final N- means from page N to end.  Set reg-
       ister a (one-character) to N.  The command-line argument
       -rN1 will number the references starting at 1.

       Four command-line registers control formatting style of
       the bibliography, much like the number registers of The
       flag -rV2 will double space the bibliography, while -rV1
       will double space references but single space annotation
       paragraphs.  The line length can be changed from the
       default 6.5 inches to 6 inches with the -rL6i argument,
       and the page offset can be set from the default of 0 to
       one inch by specifying -rO1i (capital O, not zero).  Halt
       prior to every N pages for paper loading or changing
       (default N=1).  To resume, enter NEWLINE or RETURN.  Spec-
       ify term as the terminal type.
