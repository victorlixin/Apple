       The lastcomm command gives information on previously  exe-
       cuted  commands.   lastcomm  with  no  arguments  displays
       information about all the  commands  recorded  during  the
       current  accounting file's lifetime.  If called with argu-
       ments, lastcomm only displays accounting  entries  with  a
       matching command, user, or terminal.

       lastcomm  looks for the file /var/adm/pacct, and will fail
       if it does not find it.  Accounting must be turned on,  by
       executing  /usr/lib/acct/startup,  which creates the pacct
       file.

       named  a.out,  by  user  root  while  using  the  terminal
       term/01, and lastcomm root

       would produce a listing of all the  commands  executed  by
       user root.

       items of information: the command  name  under  which  the
