       Note: the prt command is an older version of that in  most
       circumstances is more convenient to use, but is less flex-
       ible than prs.

       prt prints part or all of an SCCS file in a useful format.
       If  a  directory is named, prt behaves as though each file
       in the directory were specified as a  named  file,  except
       that  non-SCCS  files (last component of the pathname does
       not begin with s.)   and  unreadable  files  are  silently
       ignored.  If a name of `-' is given, the standard input is
       read; each line of the standard input is taken to  be  the
       name  of  an  SCCS  file to be processed.  Again, non-SCCS
       files and unreadable files are silently ignored.

       The following options are available with prt: Print  those
       types  of  deltas normally not printed by the d keyletter.
       These are types R (removed).  This keyletter is  effective
       only  if  the  d keyletter is also specified (or assumed).
       Print the body of the SCCS file.  This keyletter  normally
       prints  delta table entries of the D type.  This keyletter
       implies the d, i, u, f, and t keyletters and  is  provided
       for  convenience.   Print  the  flags  of  the named file.
       Print  the  serial  numbers  of  those  deltas   included,
       excluded,  and  ignored.  This keyletter is effective only
       if the d keyletter is also specified (or assumed).

       The following format is used to print  those  portions  of
       the  SCCS  file as specified by the above keyletters.  The
       printing of each delta table entry is preceded by  a  NEW-
       LINE.  Type of delta (D or R).  SCCS identification string
       (SID).  TAB.  Date and  time  of  creation  (in  the  form
       YY/MM/DD  HH:MM:SS).  Creator.  TAB.  Serial number.  Pre-
       decessor delta's serial number.  TAB.  Statistics (in  the
       form         inserted/deleted/unchanged).         NEWLINE.
       ``Included:TAB'', followed by SID's  of  deltas  included,
       followed  by  NEWLINE  (only if there were any such deltas
       and if i keyletter was supplied).  ``Excluded:TAB'',  fol-
       lowed  by  SID's  of  deltas excluded, followed by NEWLINE
       (see note above).  ``Ignored:TAB'', followed by  SID's  of
       deltas  ignored,  followed  by  NEWLINE  (see note above).
       ``MRs:TAB'', followed by MR numbers related to the  delta,
       followed  by  NEWLINE  (only  if  any MR numbers were sup-
       plied).  Lines of comments (delta commentary), followed by
       newline (if any were supplied).  Print only the first line
       of the delta table  entries;  that  is,  only  up  to  the
       statistics.   This  keyletter  is  effective only if the d
       keyletter is  also  specified  (or  assumed).   Print  the
       descriptive  text contained in the file.  Print the login-
       names and/or numerical group IDs of those users allowed to

       make  deltas.   Print the delta table entries to stop when
       the delta just printed has the specified SID.  If no delta
       in  the  table  has the specified SID, the entire table is
       printed.  If no SID is specified, the first delta  in  the
       delta  table  is  printed.   This keyletter will print the
       entire delta table entry for each delta as a  single  line
       (the  NEWLINE  in  the  normal  multi-line format of the d
       keyletter are replaced by

       characters) preceded by the name of the  SCCS  file  being
       processed,  followed  by  a  :,  followed  by a TAB.  This
       keyletter is effective only if the  d  keyletter  is  also
       specified  (or  assumed).   Stop  printing the delta table
       entries if the delta about to be printed is older than the
       specified  cutoff  date-time  (see for the format of date-
       time).  If no date-time is supplied, the  epoch  0000  GMT
       Jan.  1,  1970  is  used.   As  with the y keyletter, this
       keyletter will cause the entire delta table  entry  to  be
       printed as a single line and to be preceded by the name of
       the SCCS file being processed, followed by a  :,  followed
       by  a  tab.   This  keyletter  is  effective only if the d
       keyletter is also specified (or assumed).  Begin  printing
       the delta table entries when the delta about to be printed
       is older than or equal to the specified  cutoff  date-time
       (see  for  the  format  of date-time).  If no date-time is
       supplied, the epoch 0000 GMT Jan. 1, 1970  is  used.   (In
       this  case,  nothing  will  be  printed).   As  with the y
       keyletter, this keyletter  will  cause  the  entire  delta
       table  entry to be printed as a single line and to be pre-
       ceded by the name of the SCCS file being  processed,  fol-
       lowed by a :, followed by a tab.  This keyletter is effec-
       tive only  if  the  d  keyletter  is  also  specified  (or
       assumed).

       If  any  keyletter but y, c, or r is supplied, the name of
       the file being processed (preceded by one NEWLINE and fol-
       lowed  by  two  NEWLINE  characters) is printed before its
       contents.

       If none of the u, f, t, or b keyletters is supplied, the d
       keyletter is assumed.

       Note:  the  s and i keyletters, and the c and r keyletters
       are mutually exclusive; therefore, they may not be  speci-
       fied together on the same prt command.

       The form of the delta table as produced by the y, c, and r
       keyletters makes it easy to sort multiple delta tables  in
       chronological order.

       When  both  the y and c or the y and r keyletters are sup-
       plied, prt will stop printing when the first  of  the  two
       conditions is met.
