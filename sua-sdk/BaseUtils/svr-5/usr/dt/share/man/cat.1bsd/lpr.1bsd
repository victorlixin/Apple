       lpr  forwards  printer  jobs to a spooling area for subse-
       quent  printing  as  facilities  become  available.   Each
       printer  job  consists of copies of each file you specify.
       The spool area is managed by  the  line  printer  spooler,
       lpsched.   lpr  reads  from the standard input if no files
       are specified.

       Send output to the named printer.  Otherwise  send  output
       to  the printer named in the PRINTER environment variable,
       or to the default printer,  lp.   Produce  the  number  of
       copies  indicated  for  each named file.  For example: lpr
       -#3 index.c lookup.c

       produces three copies of index.c, followed by three copies
       of  lookup.c.   On  the other hand, cat index.c lookup.c |
       lpr -#3

       generates three copies of the concatenation of the  files.
       Print  class  as the job classification on the burst page.
       For example, lpr -C Operations new.index.c

       replaces the system name (the name returned  by  hostname)
       with  Operations  on  the  burst page, and prints the file
       new.index.c.  Print job as the job name on the burst page.
       Normally,  lpr  uses  the  first  file's  name.  Use title
       instead of the file name for the title used by Indent out-
       put indent

       characters.  Eight

       characters is the default.  Use cols as the page width for
       pr.  Remove the file upon completion of spooling, or  upon
       completion of printing with the -s option.  This option is
       not supported in UnixWare.   Send  mail  upon  completion.
       Suppress  printing the burst page.  Use the full pathnames
       (not symbolic links) of the files  to  be  printed  rather
       than  trying  to  copy  them.   This  means the data files
       should not be modified or removed  until  they  have  been
       printed.   -s  only  prevents  copies  of local files from
       being made.  Jobs from remote hosts are copied anyway.  -s
       only works with named data files; if the lpr command is at
       the end of a pipeline, the data is copied to the spool.
       The  following  single  letter  options  notify  the  line
       printer  spooler  that  the  files  are  not standard text
       files.  The spooling daemon will use the appropriate  fil-
       ters  to print the data accordingly.  Use pr to format the
       files (lpr -p is very much like pr | lpr).  Print  control

       characters  and  suppress  page breaks.  The files contain
       (cat phototypesetter) binary data.  The files contain data
       from  ditroff  (device independent troff).  The files con-
       tain data from tex (DVI format from Stanford).  The  files
       contain  standard plot data as produced by the routine for
       the filters used by the printer spooler.  The  files  con-
       tain  a  raster image.  The printer must support an appro-
       priate imaging model such as  PostScript(R)  in  order  to
       print  the image.  The files contain data produced by cif-
       plot.  Interpret the first character of  each  line  as  a
       standard
       FORTRAN carriage control character.

       If  no  filter_option is given (and the printer can inter-
       pret PostScript), the string `%!'  as the first two  char-
       acters  of  a  file  indicates that it contains PostScript
       commands.

       These filter options offer a standard user interface,  and
       all  options  may not be available for, nor applicable to,
       all printers.

       The printer was not found in  the  LP  database.   Usually
       this  is  a  typing mistake; however, it may indicate that
       the printer does not exist on the system.  Use `lpstat -p'
       to find the reason.
       The  connection  to  lpsched  on the local machine failed.
       This usually means the printer server started at boot time
       has  died or is hung.  Check if the printer spooler daemon
       /usr/lib/lpsched is running.  This  means  the  queue  was
       turned off with /usr/etc/lpc disable printer

       to  prevent  lpr from putting files in the queue.  This is
       normally done by the system  manager  when  a  printer  is
       going  to  be  down  for  a long time.  The printer can be
       turned back on by a privileged user with lpc.  These indi-
       cate that the LP print service has been stopped.  Get help
       from the system administrator.  It is likely there  is  an
       error  in this software.  Get help from system administra-
       tor.  Use the `lpstat -p -l' command  to  find  a  printer
       that  can  handle  the file type directly, or consult with
       your system  administrator.   Make  sure  file  names  are
       valid.

       lp is the preferred interface.

       Command-line  options  cannot  be  combined  into a single
       argument as with some other commands.   The  command:  lpr
       -fs

       is not equivalent to lpr -f -s

       Placing  the  -s  flag  first, or writing each option as a
       separate argument, makes a link as expected.

       lpr -p is not precisely equivalent to pr |  lpr.   lpr  -p
       puts the current date at the top of each page, rather than
       the date last modified.

       Fonts for and TEX(R) reside on the printer  host.   It  is
       currently not possible to use local font libraries.

       lpr objects to printing binary files.

       The  -s option does not use symbolic links in the compati-
       bility package.  Instead,  the  complete  path  names  are
       used.   Also,  the  copying is avoided only for print jobs
       that are run from the printer host itself.  Jobs added  to
       the  queue  from  a remote host are always copied into the
       spool area.  That is, if the printer does  not  reside  on
       the host that lpr is run from, the spooling system makes a
       copy the file to print, and places it in the spool area of
       the printer host, regardless of -s.

       If  userA  uses  su to become userB and uses /usr/ucb/lpr,
       then the printer request will be  entered  as  userB,  not
       userA
