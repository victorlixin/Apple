       troff formats text in the files.  Input to troff is
       expected to consist of text interspersed with formatting
       requests and macros.  If no file argument is present,
       troff reads standard input.  A - as a file argument indi-
       cates that standard input is to be read at that point in
       the list of input files; troff reads the files named ahead
       of the - in the argument list, then text from the standard
       input, and then text from the files named after the -.

       The following options may appear in any order, but they
       all must appear before the first file.  Send a printable
       approximation of the formatted output to the standard out-
       put file.  Do not print a trailer after the final page of
       output or cause the postprocessor to relinquish control of
       the device.  Read the standard input after the input files
       are exhausted.  Suppress formatted output.  Only diagnos-
       tic messages and messages output using the .tm request are
       output.  Search the directory dir for font width tables
       instead of the system-dependent default directory.
       Prepend the macro file /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/name to
       the input files.  Note: most references to macro packages
       include the leading m as part of the name; for example,
       the man macro package resides in /usr/ucblib/doc-
       tools/tmac/an.  Number first generated page N.  Print only
       pages whose page numbers appear in the comma-separated
       list of numbers and ranges.  A range N-M means pages N
       through M; an initial -N means from the beginning to page
       N; and a final N- means from N to the end.  Set register a
       (one-character) to N.  Stop the phototypesetter every N
       pages.  On some devices, troff produces a trailer so you
       can change cassettes; resume by pressing the typesetter's
       start button.  Prepare output for typesetter dest.  The
       following values can be supplied for dest: Autologic
       APS-5.  This is the default value.  Set the emboldening
       factor for the font mounted in position 3 to N.  If N is
       missing, then set the emboldening factor to 0.
