       When addbib starts up, answering y to the initial Instruc-
       tions?  prompt yields directions; typing n or

       skips them.  addbib then prompts for various bibliographic
       fields,  reads responses from the terminal, and sends out-
       put records to database.  A  null  response  ()  means  to
       leave  out  that  field.  A ``-'' (minus sign) means to go
       back to the previous field.  A trailing backslash allows a
       field  to  be  continued  on the next line.  The repeating
       Continue?  prompt allows the user either to resume by typ-
       ing  y  or , to quit the current session by typing n or q,
       or to edit database with any system editor (vi, ex, ed).

       The following options are  available:  Suppress  prompting
       for  an  abstract;  asking for an abstract is the default.
       Abstracts are ended with a CTRL-D.  Use  a  new  prompting
       skeleton, defined in promptfile.  This file should contain
       prompt strings, a TAB, and the key-letters to  be  written
       to the database.

       The  most  common key-letters and their meanings are given
       below.  addbib insulates you from these key-letters, since
       it  gives you prompts in English, but if you edit the bib-
       liography file later on, you will need to know this infor-
       mation.   Author's name Book containing article referenced
