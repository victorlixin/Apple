       fsirand  installs  random  inode generation numbers on all
       the inodes on device special, and  also  installs  a  file
       system  ID  in  the  superblock.   This helps increase the
       security of file systems exported by NFS.

       fsirand must be used only on an unmounted file system that
       has been checked with The only exception is that it can be
       used on the root file system in single-user mode,  if  the
       system is immediately re-booted afterwards.

       The  -p  option  prints out the generation numbers for all
       the inodes, but does not change the generation numbers.
