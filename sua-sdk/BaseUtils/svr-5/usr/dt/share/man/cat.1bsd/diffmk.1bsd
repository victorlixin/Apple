       The  diffmk  command  compares  two versions of a file and
       creates a third  version  that  includes  ``change  mark''
       (.mc)  commands  for nroff and troff.  oldfile and newfile
       are the old and new versions of the file.   diffmk  gener-
       ates  markedfile,  which,  contains  the text from newfile
       with ``change mark'' requests (.mc) inserted where newfile
       differs  from  oldfile.   When  markedfile  is  formatted,
       changed or inserted text is shown by a | at the right mar-
       gin  of  each line.  The position of deleted text is shown
       by a single *.

       diffmk can also be used in  conjunction  with  the  proper
       troff  requests  to  produce  program listings with marked
       changes.  In the  following  command  line:  diffmk  old.c
       new.c marked.c ; nroff reqs marked.c | pr

       the file reqs contains the following troff requests: .pl 1
       .ll 77 .nf .eo .nh

       which eliminate page breaks, adjust the line  length,  set
       no-fill  mode,  ignore  escape  characters,  and  turn off
       hyphenation, respectively.

       If the characters | and * are inappropriate, you might run
       markedfile through sed to globally change them.

       Aesthetic  considerations may dictate manual adjustment of
       some output.  File differences involving  only  formatting
       requests  may produce undesirable output, that is, replac-
       ing .sp by .sp 2 will produce a  ``change  mark''  on  the
       preceding or following line of output.
