DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       publik  prints  the  public portions of all class/template
       definitions contained, directly or indirectly, in the list
       of  input  files.  If  a  class/template  contains  nested
       classes/templates, then only the "upwardly  public"   por-
       tions of nested classes/templates are printed.

       Options modify the behavior of publik  as follows:

       -c      Do  not print comments. (Normally both the C-style
       and  C++-style  comments  in  the   public   portions   of
       classes/templates are printed.)

       -l     Print C preprocessor-style  line directives showing
       the location of each class/template definition.

       -m     Print the bodies of any member functions defined in
       their  respective  classes/templates.  (Normally omitted.)

       -p     Print the  "public:"  keyword  in  the  appropriate
       places.   (Normally  omitted,  since everything printed is
       public.)

WWaarrnniinnggss
       The class/template definitions output by  publik  are  not
       equivalent  to  their  actual  definitions, so do not  use
       them in C++ source code.

BBuuggss
       publik is spelled with a `k' in order to evade  a  problem
       with man(1)  on some machines.
