       c++filt  demangles  names  encoded  by the C++ compilation
       system that occur in ASCII text.  If no files  are  speci-
       fied,  it  reads  from standard input.  Otherwise it reads
       lines from the files in turn.  Demangling is done in place
       and  the  resulting  lines are written to standard output.
       Any non-alphanumeric character delimits possible names  to
       be demangled.

       Print, on standard error, the version number of the deman-
       gler.  Causes only whitespace to be used to delimit possi-
       ble  names to be demangled.  This means, for example, that
       a name delimited by '.' or ',' will not be demangled.

       c++filt returns 0 on success and non-zero on failure  (for
       example,  if an invalid flag was specified, or if any file
       specified on the command line could not  be  opened).   In
       the  latter  case  the  exit code represents the number of
       error conditions encountered.
