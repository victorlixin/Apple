       incl   prints  the  #include  hierarchy for the C++ source
       code contained, directly or indirectly,  in the given col-
       lection  of  files.  In the absence of any -L options, the
       standard output consists of lines of the form
           A #includes B

       where A and B are file names, and A #include's B.   Notice
       that  all  files,  including  those directly or indirectly
       included   by  the  specified  files,  are  searched   for
       #include's.

       If  graphic  output is desired, the -L option can be used.
       The output language can  be  any  of   "ps"  (postscript),
       "dag",  "pic",  "tex", or "dvi".   Multiple -L options are
       allowed.  incl  places its output for these  languages  in
       the file(s)
        incloutext, where ext is the name of the language.

       If  any of the input files to incl is dag source, (presum-
       ably produced by  a  previous  run  of  incl),   then  the
       #include  graph contained therein is incorporated into the
       current  graph.   It is up to the  user  to  make  certain
       that  the  settings  of  the a, i, and noptions which were
       used to produce the input dag  source  match  the  current
       settings.

       TeX  output produced by incl can be included in any tex or
       latex document by the following  sequence of commands:
           \input{inclout}
           \centerline{\box\graph}

       where inclout.tex is the TeX file produced by incl.

       Additional options to incl are as follows:

       -k     Only print the file names, not the enclosing <>  or
       "  characters.    See  "Bugs" for why you would want to do
       this.

       -l     Print full path names of files (the default  is  to
       print  the  name  as it appears  in the first file scanned
       that #includes it).

       -I include-directory     Search in include-directory  when
       looking   for   #include  files.   These  directories  are
       searched in order, followed by the  standard  C++  include
       directory  (/usr/include/CCunless defined otherwise in the

                                                                1

incl(1C++)                                             incl(1C++)

       incl shell script), followed by /usr/include.  If  a  file
       is not found, a warning message is printed on stderr.

       The  following options apply only to graphic output speci-
       fied by -L:

       -A     Print ascii output on the standard output in  addi-
       tion to any output(s) specified by -L.

       -v      Orient  the  #include graph vertically rather than
       horizontally.

       -b boxName     (With -Ltex.)  Make  boxName,  rather  than
       "graph", be the name of the box defined by the TeX code.

       -w width, -h height     Scale the graph width inches wide,
       height inches high.  width and height should be dimension-
       less  inches,  e.g.,  -h5.2.    The  default graph size is
       8.5x10.

       -o base     Use base, rather than  inclout,  as  the  base
       name  for all output files. base may be any arbitrary path
       name; any extension on base is ignored.

           incl -L tex -L dvi *.h

       produces page-sized TeX and dvi versions of  the  #include
       hierarchy  for  the header files in the current directory.
       The outputs are on inclout.tex  and  inclout.dvi,  respec-
       tively.   (Notice  that  inclout.dvi is not what one would
       get by directly running tex on inclout.tex.)

       incl  performs its own expansion of  #include  directives,
       instead  of  analyzing the output of the C++ preprocessor.
       This means that it is possible for the output of  incl  to
       be  different from the actual  #include hierarchy expanded
       at compile time.  This bug should probably be removed in a
       future release.

       Some  versions  of  tpic  (the pic-to-TeX converter)  gets
       confused by quotes appearing around file  names;  use  the
       -k flag in this case to suppress the quotes.
