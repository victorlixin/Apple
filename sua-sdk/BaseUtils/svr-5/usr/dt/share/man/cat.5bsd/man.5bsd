       These  macros  are  used to lay out the reference pages in
       this manual.  Note: if filename contains format input  for
       a  preprocessor,  the  commands  shown above must be piped
       through the appropriate  preprocessor.   This  is  handled
       automatically by See the ``Conventions'' section.

       Any  text argument t may be zero to six words.  Quotes may
       be used to include

       characters in a "word".  If text  is  empty,  the  special
       treatment  is  applied to the next input line with text to
       be printed.  In this way .I may be  used  to  italicize  a
       whole line, or .SB may be used to make small bold letters.

       A prevailing indent distance is remembered between succes-
       sive  indented  paragraphs,  and is reset to default value
       upon reaching a non-indented paragraph.  Default units for
       indents i are ens.

       Type font and size are reset to default values before each
       paragraph, and after  processing  font  and  size  setting
       macros.

       These strings are predefined by -man:

       (R), `(Reg)' in nroff.  Change to default type size.

       When formatting a manual page, man examines the first line
       to  determine whether it requires special processing.  For
       example a first line consisting of: '\" t

       indicates that the manual page must  be  run  through  the
       preprocessor.

       A  typical  manual  page for a command or function is laid
       out as follows: The name of the command or function, which
       serves  as the title of the manual page.  This is followed
       by the number of the section in  which  it  appears.   The
       name,  or  list  of names, by which the command is called,
       followed by a dash and then  a  one-line  summary  of  the
       action  performed.   All  in roman font, this section con-
       tains no commands or escapes, and no macro  requests.   It
       is  used to generate the database.  The syntax of the com-
       mand and its arguments, as  typed  on  the  command  line.
       When in boldface, a word must be typed exactly as printed.
       When in italics, a word can be replaced with  an  argument
       that  you  supply.  References to bold or italicized items
       are not capitalized in  other  sections,  even  when  they
       begin a sentence.

       Syntactic  symbols appear in roman face: An argument, when
       surrounded by brackets is optional.   Arguments  separated
       by  a vertical bar are exclusive.  You can supply only one
       item from such a list.  Arguments followed by an  ellipsis
       can  be  repeated.   When  an ellipsis follows a bracketed
       set, the expression within the brackets can  be  repeated.
       If  required, the data declaration, or #include directive,
       is shown first, followed  by  the   function  declaration.

                                                                2

()                                                             ()

       Otherwise, the function declaration is shown.  A narrative
       overview of the command or function's  external  behavior.
       This includes how it interacts with files or data, and how
       it handles the standard input, standard output  and  stan-
       dard error.  Internals and implementation details are nor-
       mally omitted.  This section attempts to  provide  a  suc-
       cinct  overview  in answer to the question, ``what does it
       do?''

       Literal text from the synopsis appears in constant  width,
       as  do  literal  filenames  and  references  to items that
       appear elsewhere in the reference manuals.  Arguments  are
       italicized.

       If  a  command  interprets  either subcommands or an input
       grammar, its command interface or input  grammar  is  nor-
       mally  described  in  a  USAGE  section, which follows the
       OPTIONS section.  The DESCRIPTION section  only  describes
       the behavior of the command, not that of subcommands.  The
       list of options along  with  a  description  of  how  each
       affects  the command's operation.  A list of files associ-
       ated with the command or function.  A comma-separated list
       of  related  manual pages, followed by references to other
       published materials.  A list of diagnostic messages and an
       explanation  of each.  A description of limitations, known
       defects, and possible problems associated with the command
       or function.
