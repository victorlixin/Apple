       When  a  process  waits  for  status from its children via
       either the wait, waitpid, or wait3 functions,  the  status
       returned  may  be  evaluated  with  the  following macros,
       defined in sys/wait.h. These macros evaluate  to  integral
       expressions.   The  stat  argument  to these macros is the
       integer value returned from wait or waitpid.  Evaluates to
       a  non-zero  value if status was returned for a child pro-
       cess that terminated normally.  If  the  value  of  WIFEX-
       ITED(stat)  is  non-zero, this macro evaluates to the exit
       code that the child process passed to _exit  or  exit,  or
       the  value  that  the  child  process  returned from main.
       Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was returned for a
       child process that terminated due to the receipt of a sig-
       nal.  If the value of WIFSIGNALED(stat) is non-zero,  this
       macro  evaluates  to  the number of the signal that caused
       the termination of the child process.  Evaluates to a non-
       zero value if status was returned for a child process that
       is currently stopped.  If the value of WIFSTOPPED(stat) is
       non-zero, this macro evaluates to the number of the signal
       that caused the child process to  stop.   Evaluates  to  a
       non-zero  value if status was returned for a child process
       that has continued.  If the value of WIFSIGNALED(stat)  is
       non-zero,  this  macro  evaluates to a non-zero value if a
       core image of the terminated child was created.
