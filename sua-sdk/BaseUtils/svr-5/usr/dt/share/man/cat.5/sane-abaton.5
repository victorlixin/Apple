       sane-abaton  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Abaton  flatbed  scanners.
       At  present,  only  the  Scan 300/GS (8 bit, 256 levels of
       gray) is fully supported. The Scan 300/S (black and white)
       is recognized, but support for it is untested.

       sane-abaton  expects  device  names  of  the form: special
       where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI scanners, the spe-
       cial device name must be a generic SCSI device or  a  sym-
       bolic link to such a device.

       abaton.conf  contains  a  list of device names that corre-
       spond to Abaton scanners. Empty lines and  lines  starting
       with a hash (#) are ignored.

       The  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies the
       list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
       file.  The  directories  are separated by a  colon (:). If
       this variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file  is
       searched  in two default directories: firstly, the current
       working directory (.) and then  in  /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the
       directory separator character, then the  default  directo-
       ries  are searched after the explicitly specified directo-
       ries. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to  ``/tmp/con-
       fig:''  would  result  in   directories  tmp/config, being
       searched (in this order).

       The SANE_DEBUG_ABATON environment  variable  controls  the
       debug  level  for  the sane-abaton backend, if the library
       was compiled with debug support  enabled.  For  example  a
       value  of  255  requests  all  debug output to be printed.
       Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

       SANE_CONFIG_DIR).   The  static  library implementing this
       backend.  The shared  library  implementing  this  backend
       (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

       sane-abaton  handles  all measurements in millimeters, and
       floors (rather than rounds) values to avoid possible  dam-
       age  to  the  scanner  mechanism. This means it may not be
       possible to scan to the extreme right or bottom  edges  of
       the page.

       The  cancel function might not work correctly, or it might
       abort the frontend. The former is  more  likely  than  the
       latter.
