       sane-epson  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now
       Easy) backend that provides access to Epson SCSI scanners.
       The  current  sane-epson  backend  is  known  to  work for
       GT-5000, GT-5500, and GR-8500 scanners.  For  other  scan-
       ners, it may or may not work.

       SANE_DEBUG_EPSON  environment  variable controls the debug
       level for this backend if the library  was  compiled  with
       debug  support  enabled.  For  example,  a  value  of  128
       requests all debug output to be printed.   Smaller  levels
       reduce verbosity.
