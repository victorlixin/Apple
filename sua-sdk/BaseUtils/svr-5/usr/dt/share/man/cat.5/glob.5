       The  glob.h header declares the type glob_t which includes
       the following members: Number of paths pattern  matches  A
       pointer  to  a  list  of  pathnames that have been matched
       Slots to be reserved.  Found at the beginning of gl_pathv

       The following functions are declared: int glob(const  char
       *pattern, int flags,
                int (*errfunc)(const char *epath, int eerrno),
                glob_t *pglob);

       void globfree (glob_t *pglob);

       The  flags argument requires a set of values.  The follow-
       ing constants are provided  as  values  for  flag:  Append
       newly formed pathnames to previously obtained ones A spec-
       ification of the number of null pointers  that  should  be
       added  to the start of  pglob-> gl_pathv This is to ensure
       that if an error occurs,  glob  is  returned  A  slash  is
       appended  to  each  directory pathname matching pattern If
       there is no match between a pathname and  pattern  then  a
       list  is  returned  which  contains  pattern  only disable
       backslash escaping Pathnames that are returned are not  to
       be sorted

       Error  return values have the following constants defined:
       Because (*errfunc) returned  zero  or  GLOB_ERR  was  set,
       scanning  was  terminated.   There is no match between the
       pattern and any pathname that  exists.   GLOB_NOCHECK  was
       not  set in flags.  Memory allocation failure Function not
       supported by this implementation.

                                                                1
