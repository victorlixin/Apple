       This file contains a set of manifest constants, condition-
       ally defined for particular processor architectures.

       The model assumed for integers  is  binary  representation
       (one's or two's complement), where the sign is represented
       by the value of the high-order bit.

       The number of bits in a specified type (for example, int).
       The  value of a short integer with only the high-order bit
       set.  The value of a long integer with only the high-order
       bit  set.   The  value  of a regular integer with only the
       high-order bit set.  The maximum value of a  signed  short
       integer.  The maximum value of a signed long integer.  The
       maximum value of a signed regular  integer.   The  maximum
       value of a single-precision floating-point number, and its
       natural logarithm.  The maximum value of  a  double-preci-
       sion  floating-point  number,  and  its natural logarithm.
       The maximum value of a quad-precision floating-point  num-
       ber,  and  its  natural  logarithm.   The minimum positive
       value of a single-precision floating-point number, and its
       natural  logarithm.   The minimum positive value of a dou-
       ble-precision floating-point number, and its natural loga-
       rithm.   The  minimum  value of a quad-precision floating-
       point number, and its natural logarithm.   The  number  of
       significant  bits  in  the  mantissa of a single-precision
       floating-point number.  The number of significant bits  in
       the  mantissa of a double-precision floating-point number.
       The number of significant bits in the mantissa of a  quad-
       precision floating-point number.
