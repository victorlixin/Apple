       sane-microtek2 implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access  to  some  Microtek  scanners
       with a SCSI-2 command set.

       A  different  backend  exists  for  Microtek scanners with
       SCSI-1 command set. Refer to

       The following  scanners  are  known  to  work  with  sane-
       microtek2:  Microtek E3plus Microtek X6 Microtek ScanMaker
       330 Microtek ScanMaker 630 Microtek ScanMaker 636 Microtek
       Phantom  636  Vobis HighScan If you own a Microtek scanner
       with a SCSI-2 interface other than the ones listed  above,
       it may or may not work with SANE.

       sane-microtek2  dynamically  enables  the options that are
       supported by the scanner depending  on  the  scanning-mode
       and  other  options. Unsupported options are disabled. The
       following  options  are   supported:   Color,   grayscale,
       halftone  and Line Art scans.  Highlight, midtone, shadow,
       contrast, brightness, exposure time control, gamma correc-
       tion,  threshold (dependent of the scan mode) Transparency
       media adapter, automatic document feeder

       sane-microtek2 expects device names of the  form:  special
       where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds to the scanner. The special device  name  must
       be  a  generic  SCSI  device  or a symbolic link to such a
       device.

       The  configuration  file  for  sane-microtek2  resides  in
       /usr/local/etc/sane.d/microtek2.conf.  It  is  a  list  of
       device names that correspond  to  Microtek  scanners  with
       SCSI-2  interface.  Empty  lines and lines starting with a
       hash (#) are ignored.

       The configuration file may also contain options. Currently
       two  options  are  supported:  option dump n option strip-
       height n If option dump n is enabled, additional  informa-
       tion  about the SCSI commands that are sent to the scanner
       are printed to stderr. This option is  useful  for  debug-
       ging.

       If  n=1 the contents of the command blocks and the results
       for the INQUIRY and READ SCANNER  ATTRIBUTES  command  are
       printed to stderr.

       If  n=2  the  contents of the command blocks for all other
       SCSI commands are also printed to stderr. If n=3 the  con-
       tents  of the gamma table is also printed. If n=4 all scan
       data is additionally printed to stderr.   The  default  is
       n=1.

       The  option  strip-height  n,  where n is a floating point

                                                                1

       number, limits the amount of data that is  read  from  the
       scanner with one read command. The units are in inches and
       n defaults to 1.0, if this option is not set in  the  con-
       figuration  file. If less than n inch of data fit into the
       SCSI buffer, then the  smaller  value  is  used  and  this
       option has no effect.

       If  your system has a big SCSI buffer and you want to make
       use of the whole buffer, increase  the  value  of  n.  For
       example,  if  n  is set to 14.0, no restrictions apply for
       scanners with a letter, legal or A4 sized scan area.

       The options apply to all devices in the configuration file
       and cannot be set on a per device basis.  A sample config-
       uration file is shown below: /dev/scanner # this is a com-
       ment /dev/sge

       If  the  library  was compiled with debug support enabled,
       the SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2 environment variable controls the
       debug level for this backend.  For example, a value of 128
       requests all debug output to be  printed.  Smaller  levels
       reduce  verbosity.  To  see  error  messages on stderr set
       SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2 to 1.
