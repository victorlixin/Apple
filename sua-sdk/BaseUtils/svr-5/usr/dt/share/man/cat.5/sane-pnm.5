       sane-pnm implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back-
       end that provides access to PNM  (Portable  aNyMap  files,
       which  covers  PBM  bitmap files, PGM grayscale files, and
       PPM pixmap files). The purpose of this backend is  primar-
       ily  to aid in debugging of SANE frontends. It also serves
       as an illustrative example of a minimal SANE backend.

       This backend provides two devices called 0 and 1.

       No configuration is required.

       The SANE_DEBUG_PNM environment variable controls the debug
       level  for  this  backend if the library was compiled with
       debug  support  enabled.  For  example,  a  value  of  128
       requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller levels
       reduce verbosity.
