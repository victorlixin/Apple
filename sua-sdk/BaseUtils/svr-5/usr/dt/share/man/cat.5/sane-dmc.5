       sane-dmc implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back-
       end that provides access to the  Polaroid  Digital  Micro-
       scope Camera.

       sane-dmc  expects  device names of the form: special where
       special is the  path-name for the special device that cor-
       responds to the scanner. The special device name must be a
       generic SCSI device or a symbolic link to such a device.

       The Polaroid DMC  supports  a  number  of  imaging  modes.
       sane-dmc supports: This mode corresponds to the 801-by-600
       pixel full-color full-frame image.  This mode  corresponds
       to  the  270-by-201 pixel greyscale viewfinder image. This
       image is acquired very quickly.  This mode corresponds  to
       the  1599-by-600  pixel  ``raw'' image from the CCD. It is
       greyscale, with pixels  alternating  horizontally  between
       red, green and  blue stripes. The pixels are twice as high
       as they are wide, so the image is  distorted.   This  mode
       corresponds  to  the  80-by-60  pixel full-color thumbnail
       image.  This image  is  a  1599-by-1200  pixel  full-color
       image  constructed  by  filtering  and  interpolating  the
       ``raw'' image. The filtering and interpolation is done  in
       software,  so  this  mode  is  very  slow. Also, this mode
       places restrictions on how the image is read  which  means
       that  the ``preview'' mode of does not work in Super Reso-
       lution mode.  This setting adjusts the camera's  sensitiv-
       ity.  You  can choose one of 25, 50, or 100 ``equivalent''
       ASA.  You can select a shutter speed from 8 to  1000  mil-
       liseconds.   The shutter speed is quantized in units of 32
       microseconds.   You  can  choose   between   ``Daylight'',
       ``Incandescent''  or  ``Fluorescent'' white balances. This
       setting corresponds to the ``Color Temperature''  settings
       on  Polaroid's  Windows  and Macintosh software.  dmc.conf
       contains a list of device names  that  correspond  to  DMC
       scanners.  Empty  lines and lines starting with a hash (#)
       are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown  below:
       /dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/sge

       The  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies the
       list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
       file.  The  directories  are separated by a colon (:).  If
       this variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file  is
       searched  in two default directories: firstly, the current
       working directory (.) and then  in  /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the
       directory separator character, then the  default  directo-
       ries  are searched after the explicitly specified directo-
       ries. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to  ``/tmp/con-
       fig:''  would  result  in   directories tmp/config, ., and
       /usr/local/etc/sane.d being searched (in this order).

       The  SANE_DEBUG_DC25  environment  variable  controls  the
       debug  level  for the sane-dc25 backend if the library was

                                                                1

       compiled with debugging support enabled. A  value  of  128
       requests  full  debug  output;  smaller levels reduce ver-
       bosity.

       In  the  Full  Frame and Raw modes, images must be read in
       units of entire lines. The driver performs no buffering in
       these  modes;  if you ask sane_read to read a non-integral
       number of lines, it may read less than you ask for. If you
       ask  sane_read to read less than a single line, it returns
       SANE_STATUS_INVAL.

       In the Super Resolution mode, images must be read in units
       of  two  lines  (3198 pixels or 9594 bytes.) If you try to
       read less than two lines, you get SANE_STATUS_INVAL.   The
       Super Resolution mode is very slow.

       In  the  Viewfinder  and Thumbnail modes, the entire image
       must be read in one  SCSI  transfer.  In  this  case,  the
       driver performs buffering and you can read the image in as
       small an increment as you like.
