       This  manual  page  provides  miscellaneous information on
       fonts in the UnixWare Desktop.  All such fonts are X  Win-
       dow  System fonts, either bitmapped fonts or scalable out-
       line fonts.

       All the Latin-1 (ISO8859-1) bitmapped fonts in  X11R5  are
       shipped  in  one  of three packages: dtxt (Graphics Utili-
       ties), which contains the few bitmapped fonts  needed  for
       the  X  server  to  run and a few others; desktop (Desktop
       Manager), which contains a small  set  of  fonts  of  some
       variety,  allowing  the  Desktop  to  run;  and  dtxtfonts
       (Graphics Supplemental Fonts), which contains the majority
       of  the X11R5 bitmapped fonts.  The first two packages are
       installed by default; dtxtfonts, which takes up  consider-
       able  disk  space, must be selected during installation or
       installed later.  The bitmapped fonts are in three  direc-
       tories,  75dpi, 100dpi, and misc; a 12-point font from the
       75dpi directory is 12 points on a monitor whose DPI is 75,
       but  will be slightly different from 12 points on monitors
       with other DPI resolutions.

       The Adobe Utopiatm scalable fonts from X11R5, as  well  as
       13  other Type 1 fonts licensed from Adobe, are in the atm
       package and are installed by  default.   Type  1  scalable
       fonts  are  rendered using Adobe Type Manager(R) (ATM(R)),
       which is integrated into the font server of  UnixWare;  if
       ATM  is  installed,  the  contributed Type 1 renderer from
       X11R5 is removed from the system.  The contributed  Speedo
       renderer  from X11R5 is part of the dtxtfonts package, but
       the Speedo outline fonts from X11R5 are  not  included  in
       any package.

       Some  X11R5  bitmapped fonts were supplied with ASCII-only
       character sets but  marked  as  ISO8859-1.   These  fonts,
       mostly  in  the Clean family but also in the Fixed family,
       have had their CHARSET fields in their XLFD names  changed
       to  ISO646.199-IRV.   This  convention has been adopted in
       X11R6, and is the official name for  the  ASCII  character
       set.

       The X11R5 font aliases for the Xview system, such as luci-
       dasans-10,  have  been  removed  from  this   release   of
       UnixWare.

       It  is  useful to remember that font point size is a real-
       world dimension (there are approximately 72 points  to  an
       inch) and that font sizes on your display are dependent on
       your monitor size setting.  The Display_Setup  application
       of  the Desktop allows you to change your settings for the
       graphics card you have; it also allows you to  update  the

                                                                1

fontsx(5)                                               fontsx(5)

       size  of  your display monitor; this information is stored
       in    the    option    monitor_size    in     the     file
       /usr/X/defaults/Xwinconfig.   Unfortunately,  there  is no
       way for the system to detect the  physical  size  of  your
       monitor.

       When setting your monitor size, note that monitor manufac-
       turers sometimes exaggerate the size (usually quoted as  a
       diagonal size, like 21 inches); if precision in your fonts
       (or other measures) on your display is important, you  may
       want  to  measure  your monitor size (height and width) by
       hand and use the sizes you obtain in  your  configuration.
       New  values  take  affect  the  next  time the X server is
       started.

       The X server uses the configured graphics card resolution,
       such  as  VGA  (640x480) or 1024x768, expressed in pixels,
       and the monitor size, in inches, to determine  the  effec-
       tive  DPI (dots per inch) of your screen for applications.
       This DPI value affects your fonts in two ways.

       First, scalable outline fonts rendered by ATM use the  DPI
       figure  in  figuring  out how many pixels to use to make a
       font for a requested  point  size.   Second,  the  Display
       Setup  application adjusts font configuration files if the
       DPI figure is closer to 100dpi than to  75dpi  (e.g.,  for
       high-resolution  graphics  card/monitor  combinations): it
       makes the 100dpi directory appear first in the  font  path
       so  bitmapped  fonts  closer to the real resolution of the
       monitor are used.

       Note also that the DPI value is computed for both the ver-
       tical and horizontal direction.  If your monitor size does
       not reflect the same width/height ratio  as  the  graphics
       card resolution (e.g., the 4/3 ratio of VGA and 1024/768),
       these DPI values will differ  slightly.   This  is  not  a
       problem unless exact precision is needed.

       The default (proportional) font for the Desktop in general
       is Helvetica Medium 12-point;  the  default  for  Terminal
       windows is LucidaTypewriter Medium 12-point.  These can be
       changed using the Fonts  application  in  the  Preferences
       folder.   The font shown in the text pane, and highlighted
       in the scrolling lists, when the Fonts  application  first
       starts, is the current default (proportional) font for the
       Desktop, whether the system default or the one last chosen
       by  the  user.   There  is  no  way to tell from the Fonts
       application what the current Terminal (monospaced) font is
       for   the  Desktop;  however,  it  is  the  value  of  the
       *xterm*Font resource in the user's $HOME/.Xdefaults  file,
       where it is updated by the Fonts application when the user
       changes it.

                                                                2

       Motif does not do this, and so the user sees a difference:
       Note that, especially if your graphic card/monitor config-
       uration is not precise, subtleties in the way default font
       sizes are used can make the default Helvetica font used in
       some applications a  little  smaller  or  larger  (usually
       smaller).   For  example,  when you first run the Desktop,
       the font used in the Fonts application may appear  smaller
       than  that  used  in  the window manager (e.g., for window
       titles).  This difference can be eliminated by  using  the
       Apply  to  Windows  menu  item in the Fonts application to
       change your desktop font to another font, and then back to
       Helvetica  Medium  12-point,  expressly chosen and applied
       (using the Restore Defaults menu item  will  maintain  the
       small size difference).

       The  Fonts  application  in  the Preferences folder of the
       Desktop allows you to see all  your  installed  fonts  (as
       well as to install Type 1 fonts from DOS diskettes).

       Duplicate  point  sizes  sometimes appear in the scrolling
       list for Point Size.  This is usually  caused  by  a  font
       having  the same FAMILY name but a different character set
       or AVERAGE_WIDTH.  Use the View - Character Set menu  but-
       ton and you will see the differences in the fonts.

       Fonts  that  do  not  contain the ISO8859-1 character set,
       whether they are the ASCII-only iso646.1991-irv  fonts  or
       Hebrew or Japanese fonts, cannot be used with the Apply to
       Windows feature of the Fonts application.

       Some underlying  changes  in  how  X  handles  font  names
       between X11R4 and X11R5 affect the Fonts application.  One
       consequence is that if you run the current UnixWare (based
       on  X11R5)  Fonts  client  on  a display whose X server is
       X11R4, such as UnixWare 1.x, then some scalable  fonts  on
       that  server--those  for which bitmapped fonts of the same
       family and style exist--will not show up in the Fonts win-
       dow  as  scalable; the Point Size scrolling list will show
       only the pointsizes of the bitmapped font.

       The industry effort for a common  system desktop, known as
       CDE  (Common  Desktop  Environment),  has  two sets of CDE
       Standard Font Names, the standard  Application  names  and
       the  standard  Interface  names.   These  font  names  are
       required on any X server on which the CDE Desktop is to be
       displayed.

       These  standard CDE names are implemented for the UnixWare
       X Server, even though  CDE  1.0  itself  is  not  part  of
       UnixWare.   When  this package is installed, a CDE desktop
       running on some other machine in a network may display  on
       a  UnixWare  machine's  X  display.   The names are in the

                                                                3

       Graphics  Supplemental  Fonts  package  (dtxtfonts);  this
       package must be installed for the names to be available.

       All  the CDE standard fonts names have a FAMILY_NAME field
       of -dt-.  A listing of them can thus be obtained with  the
       command: xlsfonts -fn -dt-*
