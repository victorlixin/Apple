       This  header  file  is  used by the Least Privilege Module
       (LPM) privilege mechanism. It contains the structure defi-
       nitions  for the kernel privilege table used to keep track
       of privileges on files on the system.

       These structures are as follows: represents a linked  list
       element  for  a  particular privileged file on the system.
       represents a linked list element for a  file  system  con-
       taining  files that have privilege. The element for a par-
       ticular file system contains a pointer to a linked list of
       LPMftab_t elements, each representing a privileged file on
       that file system.  represents a linked list element for  a
       physical  device  that contains a file system or file sys-
       tems that support  privileges.  Each  element  contains  a
       pointer  to  a  linked list of LPMdtab_t elements. Each of
       these elements represents a file  system  on  that  device
       with privileged files.

       The  only difference between these structures and the cor-
       responding structures SUMftab_t, SUMdtab_t, and  SUMktab_t
       used in the Super User Module (SUM) privilege mechanism is
       that the LPM structures support both fixed and inheritable
       privileges, while their SUM counterparts do not.
