       sane-microtek  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Microtek scanners. At pre-
       sent,  the  following  hardware is known to work with this
       backend: Microtek ScanMaker E2, E3, E6 Microtek  ScanMaker
       II,  IIG,  IIHR, IISP, III Microtek ScanMaker 600GS, 600ZS
       Agfa Arcus II (but not the ``Arcus'')  Vobis  ``Highscreen
       Realscan''  Transparent  Media Adapter Document AutoFeeder
       sane-microtek supports Line Art, halftone, 8bpp  gray, and
       24bpp  color  scans at normal and ``expanded'' resolutions
       (i.e. 1200x1200 on an E6), fast scans for color  previews,
       and downloadable gamma tables.

       sane-microtek  does  not support the newest Microtek scan-
       ners, such as the V330 and V660, which use a new and  very
       different SCSI-2 command set. For those, use the alternate
       backend.

       sane-microtek expects device names of  the  form:  special
       where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds to the scanner. The special device  name  must
       be  a  generic  SCSI  device  or a symbolic link to such a
       device.

       microtek.conf contains a list of device names that  corre-
       spond to Microtek scanners. Empty lines and lines starting
       with a hash (#) are ignored. A sample  configuration  file
       is  shown below: /dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/sge
       The configuration file may also contain the special  token
       noprecal. Including this will disable scanner pre-calibra-
       tion.

       The SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies  the
       list  of  directories  that  may contain the configuration
       file. The directories are separated by  a  colon  (:).  If
       this  variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file is
       searched in two default directories: firstly, the  current
       working  directory  (.)  and  then  in /etc/sane.d. If the
       value of the environment variable ends with the  directory
       separator  character,  then  the  default  directories are
       searched after the explicitly specified directories.   For
       example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to ``/tmp/config:'' would
       result in directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being
       searched (in this order).

       The  SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK environment variable controls the
       debug level for the sane-microtek backend if  the  library
       was  compiled  with  debug support enabled. For example, a
       value of 128 requests all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
       Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

       The brightness and contrast options do not work.

       The Mictrotek ScanMaker 600GS is grayscale only, and  will
       lock up if you select color. (Unfortunately, the 600GS and
       600ZS are indistinguishable by software.)

       Set the noprecal option in the configuration file if  your
       scanner locks up.

       You  can  generate  copious  stderr  output by setting the
       SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK  environment  variable.  For  example:
       setenv SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK 128
