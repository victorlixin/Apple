       sane-dc25  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner  Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Kodak DC20 and  DC25  cam-
       eras. At present, only the DC25 has been tested, but since
       the code is based on  a  DC20  interface  program,  it  is
       likely to work for that model also.

       The  current  version of the sane-dc25 backend only allows
       one camera to be connected.  The  device  name  is  always
       ``0''.

       dc25.conf  specifies the serial port and baud rate to use.
       The baud rate specifies the  maximum  rate  to  use  while
       downloading  pictures.  (The  camera is always initialized
       using 9600 baud, then switches to the higher  rate).  Sup-
       ported  baud  rates  are:  9600,  19200, 38400, 57600, and
       115200.

       The dumpinquiry line causes  some  information  about  the
       camera  to be printed to stderr during startup.  The dump-
       inquiry line  is not compatible with Do not have any dump-
       inquiry lines if you are using saned.

       Empty  lines  and  lines  starting  with  a  hash  (#) are
       ignored. A  sample  configuration  file  is  shown  below:
       port=/dev/ttyS0  #  this  is a comment baud=115200 dumpin-
       quiry

       The SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies  the
       list  of  directories  that  may contain the configuration
       file. The directories are separated by a  colon  (:).   If
       this  variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file is
       searched in two default directories: firstly, the  current
       working  directory  (.) and then in /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If the value of the environment  variable  ends  with  the
       directory  separator  character, then the default directo-
       ries are searched after the explicitly specified  directo-
       ries.  For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to ``/tmp/con-
       fig:'' would result in   directories  tmp/config,  .,  and
       /usr/local/etc/sane.d being searched (in this order).

       The  SANE_DEBUG_DC25  environment  variable  controls  the
       debug level for the sane-dc25 backend if the  library  was
       compiled  with  debugging  support enabled. A value of 128
       requests maximally copious debug  output;  smaller  levels
       reduce verbosity.

       The option reload following a scan  does  not  work.  This
       causes  problems when a new picture is snapped. The slider
       that is used to select the picture from the camera may not
       be updated immediately.
