       sane-hp  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back-
       end that provides access to HP ScanJet scanners.  At  pre-
       sent,  the  following scanners are known to work with this
       backend: ScanJet Plus,  Parallel  Interface  Card  ScanJet
       IIc, SCSI ScanJet IIcx, SCSI ScanJet IIp, SCSI ScanJet 3C,
       SCSI ScanJet 4C, SCSI ScanJet 6100C, SCSI  ScanJet  6200C,
       SCSI ScanJet 6250C, SCSI ScanJet 3P, SCSI ScanJet 4P, SCSI
       ScanJet 5P, SCSI PhotoSmart, SCSI  Any  HP  scanners  con-
       nected to the parallel port are not supported.

       sane-hp  expects  device  names of the form: special where
       special is the path-name for the special device that  cor-
       responds  to  the  scanner.  For SCSI scanners the special
       device name must be a generic SCSI device  or  a  symbolic
       link to such a device. For the HP ScanJet Plus the special
       device name must be the device  that  corresponds  to  the
       parallel interface card that was shipped with the scanner.

       hp.conf contains a list of options.  Options specified  in
       front  of  a device name are defaults for all devices man-
       aged by the backend. Options specified below a device name
       apply just to the most recently mentioned device.

       Supported  options  are  connect-scsi, and connect-device.
       connect-scsi specifies that the scanner  is  connected  to
       the  system  by SCSI. Input/output is performed using SCSI
       commands. This is the default.   connect-device  specifies
       that  the  scanner is connected to the system by a special
       device. Input or output is  performed  by  read  or  write
       operations  on the device. This option must be used for HP
       ScanJet Plus.

       A sample configuration file is shown below: /dev/scanner #
       this  is  a  comment /dev/hpscan option connect-device The
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR environment variable specifies the list of
       directories  that  may contain the configuration file. The
       directories are separated by a colon (:). If this variable
       is  not  set,  the  configuration  file is searched in two
       default directories: firstly, the current  working  direc-
       tory  (.)  and  then  in  /etc/sane.d. If the value of the
       environment variable ends  with  the  directory  separator
       character, then the default directories are searched after
       the explicitly specified directories.  For  example,  set-
       ting  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  to ``/tmp/config:'' would result in
       directories tmp/config, ., and /etc/sane.d being  searched
       (in this order).

       The  SANE_DEBUG_HP environment variable controls the debug
       level for the sane-hp backend if the library was  compiled
       with  debug  support  enabled. For example, a value of 128
       requests all debug output to be  printed.  Smaller  levels
       reduce verbosity.

                                                                1

       The  backend  configuration  file  (see the description of
       SANE_CONFIG_DIR).  The static  library  implementing  this
       backend.   The  shared  library  implementing this backend
       (present on systems that support dynamic loading).   Cali-
       bration  data  for  HP  PhotoSmart  PhotoScanner  that  is
       retrieved from the scanner after calibration.  The data is
       uploaded  to  the scanner at start of the backend if it is
       in ``print media'' mode or if the media mode is changed to
       ``print media''.

       In   media  mode  ``slide'' and ``negative'', scan resolu-
       tions must be selected as multiple of 300dpi. The  scanner
       does  not  scale  the data correctly on other resolutions.
       Some newer models (firmware code R030 and  later)  do  not
       support  adjustment  of  contrast/intensity level and tone
       map. The backend will simulate this by software, but  only
       for  gray and 24 bit color.  For use of the ADF with place
       paper in the ADF and then check  the  box  labeled  ``scan
       from  ADF''.  Press  Change document to load a sheet. Then
       press Scan to start a scan. The use of the preview  window
       is  not  recommended  when  working  with  the  ADF.  Some
       actions in (for example, unload, select media,  calibrate)
       have an immediate effect on the scanner without starting a
       scan.  These options can not be used with scanimage.
