       The  data  types  defined  in  types.h are used in  system
       code.  Some data of these types  are  accessible  to  user
       code.   The  typedef name should be used where appropriate
       since the  binding  to  underlying  types  is  subject  to
       change.   typedef  struct  {  int r[1]; }        *physadr;

       type.   See on intro(2) for information on Large File Sup-

       The form daddr_t is used for disk addresses except  in  an
       i-node  on  disk,  see,  for example, Times are encoded in
       seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1,  1970.   The  major
       and  minor  parts  of  a device code specify kind and unit
       number of a device and are  installation-dependent.   Off-
       sets  are  measured in bytes from the beginning of a file.
       The label_t variables are used to save the processor state
       while another process is running.
