       sane-dll implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) back-
       end that provides access to an arbitrary number  of  other
       SANE  backends. These backends may either be pre-loaded at
       the time the sane-dll library is built or, on systems that
       support  dynamic loading of shared libraries, the backends
       may be loaded at runtime. In the latter case, adding  sup-
       port for a new backend simply involves installing the rel-
       evant library in /usr/local/lib and adding an entry to the
       dll.conf  configuration  file. In other words, no applica-
       tions need to be modified or recompiled to add support for
       new devices.

       This  backend  expects  device  names  of  the form: back-
       end:device where backend is the name of  the  backend  and
       device  is  the  name  of  the device in this backend that
       should be addressed. If the device name does not contain a
       colon (:), then the entire string is treated as the device
       string for the default backend. The default backend is the
       backend  listed last in the configuration file (see below)
       or the first pre-loaded backend (if any).

       dll.conf contains a list of  backend  names  that  may  be
       loaded  dynamically  upon  demand.  Empty  lines and lines
       starting with a hash (#) are ignored.  A sample configura-
       tion  file  is  shown  below:  net # this is a comment pnm
       mustek Backends that are  pre-loaded  when  building  this
       library  do  not  have  to be listed in this configuration
       file. That is, if a backend is pre-loaded, then that back-
       end  will  always  be present, regardless of whether it is
       listed in the configuration file or not.

       The list of pre-loaded backends is determined by the macro
       PRELOADABLE_BACKENDS  in  file  backend/Makefile.in of the
       SANE source code distribution. After changing the value of
       this  macro,  it is necessary to reconfigure, rebuild, and
       reinstall SANE for the change to take effect.

       The SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies  the
       list  of  directories  that  may contain the configuration
       file. The directories are separated by a  colon  (:).   If
       this  variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file is
       searched in two default directories: firstly, the  current
       working  directory  (.) and then in /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If the value of the environment  variable  ends  with  the
       directory  separator  character, then the default directo-
       ries are searched after the explicitly specified  directo-
       ries.  For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to ``/tmp/con-
       fig:'' would result in   directories  tmp/config,  .,  and
       /usr/local/etc/sane.d being searched (in this order).

       The SANE_DEBUG_DLL environment variable controls the debug
       level for the sane-dc25 backend if the  library  was  com-
       piled  with  debugging  support  enabled.  A  value of 128

                                                                1

       requests full debug output;  smaller  levels  reduce  ver-
       bosity.
