       sane-mustek  implements  a  SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Mustek  flatbed  scanners.
       The  following scanners are known to work: MFC-600S 1-pass
       MFC-600CD  1-pass  MFS-6000CX  3-pass  MSF-6000SP   1-pass
       MFS-8000SP   1-pass   MFC-800S  1-pass  MFS-1200SP  1-pass
       MFS-1200SP 1-pass  MFS-1200SP  1-pass  MFS-12000CX  3-pass
       SE-6000SP 1-pass SE-12000SP 1-pass

       sane-mustek  expects  device  names  of  the form: special
       where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds  to  a  SCSI  scanner.  For SCSI scanners, the
       special device name must be a generic  SCSI  device  or  a
       symbolic link to such a device.

       mustek.conf  contains  a  list of options and device names
       that correspond to Mustek scanners.  Empty lines and lines
       starting with a hash (#) are ignored.

       The three options supported are linedistance-fix, lineart-
       fix, and strip-height. There are  two  types  of  options:
       global and positional. Global options apply to all devices
       managed by the backend whereas  positional  options  apply
       just  to  the  most  recently mentioned device. This means
       that the order in which the options appear  is  important.
       linedistance-fix  is positional and works around a problem
       that occurs with some SCSI  controllers.  If  color  scans
       have  horizontal  stripes  and the colors are in black and
       white, then it is likely that your controller suffers from
       this  problem.  Turning  on  this option usually fixes the
       problem.

       lineart-fix is positional and works around a timing  prob-
       lem that seems to exist with certain MFS-12000SP scanners.
       The problem manifests itself in dropped lines  when  scan-
       ning  in  Line Art mode. Turning on this option should fix
       the problem but may slow down scanning.

       strip-height is a global option that  limits  the  maximum
       height  of  the strip scanned with a single SCSI read com-
       mand. The height is specified in inches and may contain  a
       fractional  part  (for  example,  1.5). Setting the strip-
       height to a small value (one inch,  for  example)  reduces
       the  likelihood  of encountering problems with SCSI driver
       timeouts and timeouts with other devices on the same  SCSI
       bus.  Unfortunately,  it also increases scan times.  Thus,
       if the scanner is the only device on the SCSI  bus  it  is
       connected  to and if it is known that the SCSI driver does
       not suffer from premature timeouts, it is  recommended  to
       increase the strip-height or remove the option completely,
       which corresponds to an infinite strip height.

       A sample configuration file is shown below: # limit  strip
       height  of /dev/scanner to 1.5 inches: option strip-height

                                                                1

       The  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies the
       list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
       file.  The  directories  are  separated by a colon (:). If
       this variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file  is
       searched  in two default directories: firstly, the current
       working directory (.) and then  in  /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the
       directory separator character, then the  default  directo-
       ries  are searched after the explicitly specified directo-
       ries. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to  ``/tmp/con-
       fig:''  would  result  in  directories  tmp/config, ., and
       /usr/local/etc/sane.d being searched (in this order).

       SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK environment variable controls the  debug
       level  for  sane-mustek,  if the library was compiled with
       debug  support  enabled.  For  example,  a  value  of  128
       requests  all  debug  output to be printed. Smaller levels
       reduce verbosity.

       Mustek  SCSI  scanners are typically delivered with an ISA
       SCSI adapter. Unfortunately, that adapter is not interrupt
       driven.   It  is  (sometimes) possible to get the supplied
       card to work, but without  the  interrupt  line,  scanning
       will  load  the system, so that it becomes almost unusable
       for other tasks.

       If you already have a working SCSI controller in your sys-
       tem,  you should consider that Mustek scanners do not sup-
       port the SCSI-2 disconnect/reconnect  protocol  and  hence
       tie  up  the  SCSI  bus  while a scan is in progress. This
       means that no other SCSI device on the  same  bus  can  be
       accessed while a scan is in progress.

       Because  the  Mustek-supplied  adapter  is  not  interrupt
       driven and because Mustek  scanners  do  not  support  the
       SCSI-2 disconnect/reconnect protocol, it is recommended to
       install a separate SCSI  controller  for  Mustek  scanners
       (for example, ncr810 based cards).

       For   Mustek   scanners,  it  is  typically  necessary  to

                                                                2

       configure the low-level SCSI driver to disable synchronous
       transfers, tagged command queuing, and target disconnects.

       The ScanExpress models sometimes have  trouble  with  high
       resolution color mode. If you encounter sporadic corrupted
       images (parts duplicated or  shifted  horizontally),  kill
       all  other applications before scanning and (if sufficient
       memory available) disable swapping.

       After a while of no activity, some scanners (not the  SANE
       backend)  turn  off their CCFL lamps. This shutdown is not
       always perfect with the result  that  the  lamp  sometimes
       continues  to  glow dimly at one end. This does not appear
       to be dangerous since as  soon  as  you  use  the  scanner
       again,  the  lamp turns back on to the normal high bright-
       ness. However, the first image scanned after such a  shut-
       down  may have stripes and appear to be over-exposed. When
       this happens, take another scan to get a good image.

       Transparency adapter and automatic document feeder support
       is lacking.

       There  is  a  performance  problem  that makes scanning on
       three-pass scanners slower than necessary. High resolution
       with  ScanExpress  scanners  is  slow  as they have a very
       small internal buffer.
