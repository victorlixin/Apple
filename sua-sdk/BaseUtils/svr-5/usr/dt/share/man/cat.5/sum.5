       This  header  file  is used by the Super User Module (SUM)
       privilege mechanism. It contains the structure definitions
       for the kernel privilege table used to keep track of priv-
       ileges on files on the system.

       These structures are as follows: represents a linked  list
       element  for  a  particular privileged file on the system.
       represents a linked list element for a  file  system  con-
       taining  files that have privilege. The element for a par-
       ticular file system contains a pointer to a linked list of
       SUMftab_t elements, each representing a privileged file on
       that file system.  represents a linked list element for  a
       physical  device  that contains a file system or file sys-
       tems that support  privileges.  Each  element  contains  a
       pointer  to  a  linked list of SUMdtab_t elements. Each of
       these elements represents a file  system  on  that  device
       with privileged files.

       The  only difference between these structures and the cor-
       responding structures LPMftab_t, LPMdtab_t, and  LPMktab_t
       used  in the Least Privilege Module (LPM) privilege mecha-
       nism is that the LPM structures  support  both  fixed  and
       inheritable  privileges,  while  their SUM counterparts do
       not.
