       Hostnames  are  domains, where a domain is a hierarchical,
       dot-separated  list  of  subdomains.   For  example,   the
       machine laiter, in the Lachman subdomain of the COM subdo-
       main of the ARPANET would be represented  as  laiter.Lach-
       man.COM (with no trailing dot).

       Hostnames  are  often  used with network client and server
       programs, which must generally translate the  name  to  an
       address  for use.  The name-to-address translation is gen-
       erally performed by the library routine gethostbyname [see

       Hostnames  are  resolved  by the Internet name resolver in
       the following fashion: If the name consists  of  a  single
       component  (contains no dot), and if the environment vari-
       able HOSTALIASES is set to the name of a file,  that  file
       is  searched  for  an  string matching the input hostname.
       The file should consist of lines made  up  of  two  white-
       space  separated  strings, the first of which is the host-
       name alias, and the second of which is the complete  host-
       name  to  be substituted for that alias.  If a case-sensi-
       tive match is found between the hostname  to  be  resolved
       and the first field of a line in the file, the substituted
       name is looked up with  no  further  processing.   If  the
       input  name  ends with a trailing dot, the trailing dot is
       removed, and the remaining name is looked up with no  fur-
       ther  processing.   If  the input name does not end with a
       trailing dot, it is looked up in the local domain and  its
       parent domains until either a match is found or fewer than
       two components of the local domain remain.   For  example,
       in the domain CHI.Lachman.COM, the name flaime.STG will be
       checked first as flaime.STG.CHI.Lachman.COM  and  then  as
       flaime.STG.Lachman.COM.  flaime.STG.COM will not be tried,
       as there is only one component remaining  from  the  local
       domain.
