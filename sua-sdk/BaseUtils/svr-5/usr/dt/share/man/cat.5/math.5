       This  file  contains  declarations of all the functions in
       the Math Library (described in Section  3M),  as  well  as
       various  functions  in  the  C  Library  (Section 3C) that
       return double, float and long double-precision values.

       It defines the structure and constants used by the  error-
       handling mechanisms, including the following constant used
       as an error-return value: The maximum value of  a  single-
       precision floating-point number.

       The  following mathematical constants are defined for user
       convenience: The base  of  natural  logarithms  (e).   The
       base-2  logarithm  of e.  The base-10 logarithm of e.  The
       natural logarithm of 2.  The natural logarithm of 10.   -n,
       the  ratio  of the circumference of a circle to its diame-
       ter.  -n/2.  -n/4.  1/-n.  2/-n.  2/\/-n.  The positive  square
       root of 2.  The positive square root of 1/2.

       The numerical classification constants are defined in this
       header file: represent the  mutually  exclusive  kinds  of
       possible  floating-point  values.   They expand to integer
       constant expressions with distinct values.

       The following  fma  performance  indicator  constants  are
       defined in this header file: If defined, FP_FAST_FMA indi-
       cates that generally executes about as fast as, or  faster
       than  a  multiply  and  an  add  of  double  operands.  If
       defined, FP_FAST_FMF  indicates  that  generally  executes
       about  as fast as, or faster than a multiply and an add of
       float operands.  If defined, FP_FAST_FMAL  indicates  that
       generally executes about as fast as, or faster than a mul-
       tiply and an add  of  long  double  operands.   Typically,
       these  constants are only defined if the fma functions are
       implemented directly with a hardware multiply-add instruc-
       tion.

       The  following  ilogb constants are defined in this header
       file: Is set to either INT_MIN or -INT_MAX when is  called
       with  its  argument set to zero.  Is set to either INT_MAX
       or INT_MIN when is called with its argument set to NaN.

       The following integer constants used  by  math_errhandling
       are defined in this header file: Expands to 1.  Expands to
       2.

       The following mathematical constants are also  defined  in
       this header file: The maximum value of a non-infinite sin-
       gle-precision floating point number.   A  double  constant
       expression  representing  positive infinity.  A float con-
       stant expression representing positive infinity.   A  long

                                                                1

math(5)                                                   math(5)

       double constant expression representing positive infinity.

       The following constant is only defined  on  machines  that
       support  quiet  NaNs  for the float type: A float constant
       expression representing a quiet NaN.

       stants, see
