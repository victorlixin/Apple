       sane-pint  5  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that  provides  generic  access  to  handheld  and
       flatbed scanners using the PINT device driver.

       PINT is designed to provide an interface to many different
       scanner types. However, this backend has only been  tested
       with flatbed single-pass scanners.

       This  backend  expects  device  names of the form: special
       where special is the path-name for the special device that
       corresponds  to  the scanner. The special device name must
       be a PINT device or a symbolic link to such a device.

       pint.conf contains a list of device names that  correspond
       to  PINT  scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a
       hash (#) are ignored. A sample configuration file is shown
       below: /dev/scanner # this is a comment /dev/ss1

       The  SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies the
       list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
       file.  The  directories  are  separated by a colon (:). If
       this variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file  is
       searched  in two default directories: firstly, the current
       working directory (.) and then  in  /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the
       directory separator character, then the  default  directo-
       ries  are searched after the explicitly specified directo-
       ries. For example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to  ``/tmp/con-
       fig:''  would  result  in  directories  tmp/config,  being
       searched (in this order).

       The  SANE_DEBUG_PINT  environment  variable  controls  the
       debug  level  for this backend if the library was compiled
       with debug support enabled. For example, a  value  of  128
       requests  all  debug output to be printed.  Smaller levels
       reduce verbosity.

       There  are  minor  round  off  errors  when  adjusting the
       ranges, since PINT uses units of 1/1200 of  an  inch,  and
       SANE  normally  uses millimeters. Symptoms of these errors
       are skewed images. Use inches as the  scanning  unit,  and
       the scanner works correctly.

       The  PINT  0.5e interface does not provide a way to deter-
       mine valid ranges for DPI, modes, and scan sizes. The SANE
       backend queries the PINT device, and dynamically discovers

                                                                1

       valid ranges by doing a binary search. This means that the
       driver takes longer to initialize than seems necessary.

       Resetting the scanner does not seem to work. For that rea-
       son, the  driver  sends  a  SCIOCRESTART,  then  uses  any
       remaining  input  until  it  reaches  the  end of the file
       (EOF).

       Not all of the scanners have been identified as flatbed or
       handheld scanners.

       X and Y resolutions are assumed to be the same.

       No  testing  has been done on three-pass or handheld scan-
       ners, or with Automatic Document Feeder support.
