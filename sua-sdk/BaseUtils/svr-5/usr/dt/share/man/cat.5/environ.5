       When a process begins execution, exec routines make avail-
       able an array of strings called the  environment  [see  By
       convention,  these  strings  have the form variable=value,
       for  example,  PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin.   These   environment
       variables  provide  a way to make information about a pro-
       gram's environment available to programs.  The environment
       variables  described below can be used by applications and
       are expected to be set in the target runtime  environment.

       Further  names  may  be  placed  in the environment by the
       export command and name=value arguments in  or  by  It  is
       unwise  to  conflict with certain shell variables that are
       frequently exported by .profile files: MAIL, PS1, PS2, IFS

       The program's  locale.   Locales  consist  of  files  that
       describe  the conventions appropriate to some nationality,
       culture, and language.  The $HOME/.env file  usually  sets
       the  LANG  variable.  This file is set by the Account Man-
       ager and overrides the system defaults. If the  $HOME/.env
       file  is not present on the system, /etc/default/locale is
       used.

       Generally, users determine which  files  are  selected  by
       manipulating  the  environment  variables described below.
       For background, see

       Locales  are  partitioned  into   categories   LC_COLLATE,
       LC_CTYPE,   LC_MESSAGES,   LC_MONETARY,   LC_NUMERIC,  and
       LC_TIME (see  below  for  what  the  categories  control).
       LC_ALL  overrides all these categories.  Each category has
       a corresponding environment variable that the user can set
       to       specify       that       category's       locale:
            LC_CTYPE=fr[ancais]

       When the LC_ALL variable is set, it  overrides  all  other
       LC_*  variables, as well as the LANG setting.  When LC_ALL
       is not set, the LANG environment variable is  searched  if
       the environment variable for a category is unset or empty:
            LANG=fr      LC_COLLATE=de[utsche]

       sets all the categories but LC_COLLATE to French.  If LANG
       is  unset  or empty, the default C locale is used.  speci-
       fies the name of the locale to be used.  This value  over-
       rides  values  for locale categories specified by the LANG

       A colon-separated list of network identifiers.  A  network
       identifier  is  a  character  string  used  by the Network
       Selection component of the system to provide  application-
       specific  default network search paths.  A network identi-
       fier must consist of non-NULL characters and must  have  a
       length  of  at  least  1.  No maximum length is specified.
       Network identifiers are  normally  chosen  by  the  system
       administrator.   A  network  identifier  is also the first
       field in any /etc/netconfig file entry.  NETPATH thus pro-
       vides a link into the /etc/netconfig file and the informa-
       tion about a network contained in  that  network's  entry.
       /etc/netconfig  is maintained by the system administrator.
       The library routines described in access the NETPATH envi-
       ronment variable.

       Contains  a sequence of templates which uses when attempt-
       ing to locate message catalogs.  Each template consists of
       a  pathname  containing  one or more optional substitution
       fields.

                                                                2

environ(5)                                             environ(5)

       For example:      NLSPATH="/system/nlslib/%N.cat"

       specifies that catopen should look for all  message  cata-
       logs  in  the  directory /system/nlslib, where the catalog
       name should be constructed from the name parameter  passed
       to catopen, %N, with the suffix .cat.

       Substitution  fields  consist of a % symbol, followed by a
       single-letter keyword.  The following  keywords  are  cur-
       rently   defined  (where  locale  elements  are  described
       below):

       --------------------------------------------------------
       %N   The value of the name parameter passed to catopen.
       %L   The value of locale.
       %l   The language element from locale.
       %t   The territory element from locale.
       %c   The codeset element from locale.
       %%   A single % character.
       %A   The value of the archive portion of a name@archive
            parameter passed to catopen.

       locale provides the ability to specify the user's require-
       ments for native language, local  customs,  and  character
       set,  as  an  ASCII  string  in  the form language[_terri-
       tory[.codeset]]

       A user who speaks German as it is spoken  in  Austria  and
       has a terminal which operates in ISO 8859/1 codeset, would
       want the setting of the locale to be De_A.88591

       An empty string is substituted if the specified  value  is
       not currently defined.  The separators ``_'' and ``.'' are
       not included in %t and %c substitutions.

       Templates defined in NLSPATH are separated by colons  (:).
       A  leading colon or two adjacent colons (::) is equivalent
       to specifying %N.

       For example:   NLSPATH=":%N.cat:/nlslib/%L/%N.cat"

       indicates to catopen that it should look for the requested
       message     catalog     in     name,     name.cat,     and
       /nlslib/locale/name.cat.

       The %A keyword is provided for compatibility  with  &ever-
       est;  applications  that  use the name@archive form of the
       name argument to catopen.  If @archive is present, then  a
       %A  in NLSPATH is replaced with the archive portion of the
       name passed to catopen.  If @archive is not present,  then
       nothing is substitued for %A in NLSPATH.

       The sequence of directory prefixes that and so on apply in
       searching for a file known by  an  incomplete  path  name.

       When the shell is invoked, it scans  the  environment  for
       this name.  If it is found and rsh is the filename part of
       its value, the shell  becomes  a  restricted  shell.   The
       value  of  this variable should be specified with an abso-
       lute pathname.  The variable is used by  and  among  other
       commands.

   TTEERRMM
       The  kind  of terminal for which output is to be prepared.
       This information is used by commands, such  as  which  may
       exploit special capabilities of that terminal.

   TTZZ
       Time  zone  information.   The contents of the environment
       variable named TZ are used by the functions localtime [see
       and to override the default time zone.

       If  the  first  character  of  TZ  is  a colon (:), as in:
       TZ=:name then name is assumed to be  a  full  or  relative
       path  to  a  tic-compiled timezone description (see If the
       first character of name is  a  slash  (/),  then  name  is
       assumed  to  be a full pathname;  otherwise, the directory
       /usr/lib/locale/TZ/ is searched for a file with  the  sup-
       plied name.

       If  the  first  character of TZ is not a colon (:), TZ has
       the                                                  form:
         stdoffset[dst[offset],[start[/time],end[/time]]]   Three
       or more bytes that are the designation  for  the  standard
       (std)  and  daylight  savings time (dst) time zones.  Only
       std is required, if dst is missing, then daylight  savings
       time  does not apply in this locale.  Upper- and lowercase
       letters are allowed.   Any  characters  except  a  leading
       colon (:), digits, a comma (,), a minus (-), or a plus (+)
       are allowed.  Indicates the value  one  must  add  to  the
       local  time  to arrive at Coordinated Universal Time.  The
       offset has the form:   hh[:mm[:ss]]

       The minutes (mm) and seconds (ss) are optional.  The  hour
       (hh)  is  required  and may be a single digit.  The offset
       following std is required.  If no offset follows dst, day-
       light  savings  time  is  assumed  to be one hour ahead of
       standard time.  One or more digits may be used; the  value
       is  always interpreted as a decimal number.  The hour must
       be between 0 and 24, and the minutes (and seconds) if pre-
       sent  between  0  and  59.   Out of range values may cause
       unpredictable behavior.  If preceded by a ``-'', the  time

                                                                4

       zone  is  east of the Prime Meridian; otherwise it is west
       (which may be indicated by  an  optional  preceding  ``+''
       sign).  Indicates when to change to and back from daylight
       savings time, where start/time describes when  the  change
       from  standard  time  to daylight savings time occurs, and
       end/time describes when the  change  back  happens.   Each
       time  field  describes  when,  in  current local time, the
       change is made.

       The formats of start and end are one of the following: The
       Julian  day n (1 <= n <= 365).  Leap days are not counted.
       That is, in all years, February 28 is day 59 and  March  1
       is  day  60.   It is impossible to refer to the occasional
       February 29.  The zero-based Julian day (0 <= n  <=  365).
       Leap  days  are  counted,  and  it is possible to refer to
       February 29.  Specifies a change to or from the  alternate
       timezone  on day d (default of 0 or Sunday) of week number
       n, where the first day of the year is in week 1.  The  dth
       day,  (0 <= d <= 6) of week n of month m of the year (1 <=
       n <= 5, 1 <= m <= 12), where week 5 means ``the last d-day
       in  month  m'' which may occur in either the fourth or the
       fifth week).  Week 1 is the first week in  which  the  dth
       day occurs.  Day zero is Sunday.

       Implementation-specific  defaults  are  used for start and
       end if these optional fields are not given.

       The time has the same format  as  offset  except  that  no
       leading sign (``-'' or ``+'') is allowed.  The default, if
       time is not given is 02:00:00.
