       sane-umax  implements  a SANE backend that provides access
       to several UMAX-SCSI scanners and some Linotye  Hell  SCSI
       scanners.  Parallel and USB scanners are not supported.

       The   configuration   file   for   sane-umax   resides  in
       /usr/local/etc/sane.d/umax.conf. It is a  list  of  device
       names  that  correspond to UMAX scanners.  Empty lines and
       lines starting with a hash (#) are ignored.  A sample con-
       figuration  file  is  shown below: #scsi Vendor Model Type
       Bus Channel ID  LUN  scsi  UMAX  *  Scanner  *  *  *  *  *
       /dev/scanner  #  this  is  a  comment /dev/sge The special
       device name must be a generic SCSI device  or  a  symbolic
       link to such a device.

       The  SANE_DEBUG_UMAX  environment  variable  controls  the
       debug level for the backend if the  library  was  compiled
       with  debug  support  enabled.  For example a value of 128
       requests all debug output to be printed.   Smaller  levels
       reduce verbosity.  For example: export SANE_DEBUG_UMAX=8

       The SCSI adapters that are shipped with some UMAX scanners
       are  not  supported by most platforms, so you need to pur-
       chase another SCSI adapter that is supported by your plat-
       form.

       UMAX  scanners  block the SCSI bus for a few seconds while
       scanning. It is not necessary to connect  the  scanner  to
       its own SCSI adapter. However if you need a short response
       time for your SCSI hard disk (for example,  if  your  com-
       puter  is  a  file-server), connect the scanner to its own
       SCSI adapter.

       X-resolutions greater than 600dpi  sometimes  cause  prob-
       lems.

       If  you  are  performing  the  first scans, be prepared to
       switch the scanner off.
