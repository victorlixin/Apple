       sane-apple  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner Access Now Easy)
       backend that provides access to Apple flatbed scanners. At
       present,  the  following  scanners are supported from this
       backend: AppleScanner (4 bit, 16 shades of gray)  OneScan-
       ner  (8  bit, 256 shades of gray) ColorOneScanner (24 bit,
       RGB color 3-pass) sane-apple expects device names  of  the
       form:  special where special is the path-name for the spe-
       cial device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner.  For  SCSI
       scanners,  the  special device name must be a generic SCSI
       device or a symbolic link to such a device.

       apple.conf contains a list of  options  and  device  names
       that  correspond  to Apple scanners. Empty lines and lines
       starting with a hash (#) are ignored.

       Options are either global or positional.   Global  options
       apply  to all devices managed by the backend whereas posi-
       tional options apply just to the most  recently  mentioned
       device.  The order in which the options appear affects the
       outcome.

       The SANE_CONFIG_DIR  environment  variable  specifies  the
       list  of  directories  that  may contain the configuration
       file. The directories are separated by  a  colon  (:).  If
       this  variable  is  not  set,  the  configuration  file is
       searched in two default directories: firstly, the  current
       working  directory  (.) and then in /usr/local/etc/sane.d.
       If the value of the environment  variable  ends  with  the
       directory  separator  character, then the default directo-
       ries are searched after the explicitly specified  directo-
       ries.  For  example, setting SANE_CONFIG_DIR to "/tmp/con-
       fig:" would result in directories tmp/config,

       The SANE_DEBUG_APPLE  environment  variable  controls  the
       debug  level  for this backend if the library was compiled
       with debug support enabled. For example, a  value  of  255
       requests  all  debug  output to be printed. Smaller levels
       reduce verbosity.

       There  are  some  GUI  and scanner problems with the sane-
       apple backend.

       The GUI does not always display a parameter as active.

       Some dependencies may be missing. For  example  the  Apple
       Scanners   Programming   Guide   says  nothing  about  the

                                                                1

       threshold parameter. It is assumed that it is  valid  only
       in Line  Art mode.

       Scanner  specific  problems  are due to rounding values in
       order to scan.

       Other problems are due to SCSI  communication,  SCSI  con-
       nects  and disconnects. You may encounter buffer overruns,
       null pointers, memory corruption and SANE API  violations.
       For example, changing the SCSI card from Adaptec 2940UW to
       a dual-channel Symbios 786 chipset causes Gray16 scans  to
       give  a  stream  of  SCSI  error  messages on the console.
       Ultimately it hangs with a message saying the  scanner  is
       not releasing the SCSI bus.

       SCSI  scanners  are  usually  delivered  with  an ISA SCSI
       adapter. This adapter is not interrupt driven and in  many
       cases it will not work with the scanner. It is possible to
       get the supplied card to work, but without  the  interrupt
       line,  scanning  will put so much load on the system, that
       it becomes unusable for other tasks.

       When you try to modify the scan area from the  slice  bar,
       sane-apple  produces  a  core dump. If you select the scan
       area from the preview window, or type the scan area dimen-
       sions, sane-apple works correctly.

       It  is  possible  that sane-apple options panel can exceed
       the dimensions of your screen,  especially  for  the  Col-
       orOneScanner.   If this happens try using smaller fonts in
       the X server, or use virtual screens.

       If you encounter a problem, set the  environment  variable
       SANE_DEBUG_APPLE  to  255 and re-run the exact sequence of
       keystrokes and menu selections to reproduce it.
