       The  signal event structure sigevent is used to select and
       set up completion notification for asynchronous I/O.

       The sigevent structure is used  by  the  asynchronous  I/O
       request  routines aio_read and aio_write to select and set
       up completion notification.  The sigevent structure  is  a
       component  of  the  aiocb  asynchronous  I/O control block
       structure.  This structure is declared in siginfo.h and is
       included  by  signal.h.   Int  contains the following ele-
       ments: union sigval
             int   sival_int;             /* integer value */
             void *sival_ptr;             /* pointer value */

       int             sigev_notify;      /* notification mode */
       union    notinfo      sigev_notifyinfo;    union    sigval
       sigev_value;        /*  signal  value       */  sigev_func
       notifyinfo.nifunc sigev_signo     notifyinfo.nisigno

       If  you do not wish to be notified when using asynchronous
       I/O, set the sigev_notify element to SIGEV_NONE.

       If  notification  via  function   callback   is   desired,
       sigev_notify   should   be   set   to  SIGEV_CALLBACK  and
       sigev_func should be set to the address of the function to
       be  called.   sigev_value should be set to the value to be
       passed to the function called.  Often, it is convenient to
       pass  the address of the asynchronous control block corre-
       sponding to the request in sigev_value.
