       The  ucontext structure defines the context of a thread of
       control within an executing process.

       This structure includes at least  the  following  members:
       ucontext_t    *uc_link   sigset_t      uc_sigmask  stack_t
       uc_stack mcontext_t  uc_mcontext

       uc_link is a pointer to the context that is to be  resumed
       when this context returns.  If uc_link is equal to 0, then
       this context is the main context, and  the  process  exits
       when  this  context  returns.   The  uc_link field is only
       meaningful for contexts created using makecontext.

       uc_sigmask defines the set of  signals  that  are  blocked
       when this context is active [see

       uc_stack defines the stack used by this context [see

       uc_mcontext  contains  the  saved set of machine registers
       and any implementation specific  context  data.   Portable
       applications should not modify or access uc_mcontext.

       The  ucontext structure has been enhanced to handle float-
       ing point context information for Pentium III  processors.
