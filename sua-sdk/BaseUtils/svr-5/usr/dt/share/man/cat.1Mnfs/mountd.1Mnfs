       The mountd command is an RPC server that answers file sys-
       tem mount requests. It reads the  file  /etc/dfs/sharetab,
       described  in to determine which filesystems are available
       for mounting by which machines. It also provides  informa-
       tion  as to what filesystems are mounted by which clients.
       This information can be printed using the command.

   OOppttiioonnss
       With -n, mountd does not check that the clients  are  root
       users.  Though  this  option  makes  things  slightly less
       secure, it does allow older versions (pre-3.0)  of  client
       to work.

       The mountd daemon is automatically invoked in run level 3.

       Only a privileged user can execute this command.
