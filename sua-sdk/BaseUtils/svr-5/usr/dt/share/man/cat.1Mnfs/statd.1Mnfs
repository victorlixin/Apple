       The  statd daemon is automatically invoked in run level 3.
       The crash of a site is only detected  upon  its  recovery.
       When  is restarted, statd will display notices on the sys-
       tem console if any machine which was involved in  file and
       record  locking  before  the  restart,  is currently down.
       These messages can be avoided by removing all  files  from
       the  /etc/sm and /etc/sm.bak directories before restarting
       . A typical message is as follows: rpc.statd: cannot  talk
       to statd at <host> Only a privileged user can execute this
       command.
