       The -specific mount command attaches a named path residing
       on machine server to the filesystem hierarchy at the path-
       name  location mountpoint, which must already exist. mount
       maintains a table of mounted filesystems  in  /etc/mnttab,
       described in

       The    -specific    umount    command    is   located   in
       /usr/lib/fs/nfs/umount and is called by the generic umount
       command.  umount  unmounts  a  filesystem  and removes the
       appropriate entry from /etc/mnttab.

       The following options are available to the mount  command:
       Specifies  the File System Type (FSType). If the -F option
       is omitted, mount will attempt to determine the filesystem
       type  automatically.  Mount the specified filesystem read-
       only.  Specify filesystem specific options in a comma-sep-
       arated  list  of  words  from  the  following list: (NFSv3
       only.) Specifies  how  long  to  cache  access  permission
       entries.  The  default  period is 30 seconds. A value of 0
       turns off caching.  Hold cached  attributes  for  no  more
       than  n seconds after directory update. The default is 60.
       Hold cached attributes for at least n seconds after direc-
       tory  update.  The  default is 30.  Hold cached attributes
       for no more than n seconds after  file  modification.  The
       default is 60.  Hold cached attributes for at least n sec-
       onds after file modification. The default is 3.  Set mini-
       mum and maximum times for regular files and directories to
       n  seconds.  This  option  is   equivalent   to   setting:
       acdirmin=acdirmax=acregmin=acregmax=n  (NFSv3  only.)  All
       writes to the filesystem will be performed asynchronously.
       This  may improve performance but carries with it the risk
       of data loss on server  crashes.   If  the  first  attempt
       fails,  retry as a background process, or, as a foreground
       process. The default isfg.  Create a file with its GID set
       to the effective GID of the calling process. This behavior
       may be overridden on a per-directory basis by setting  the
       set-GID bit of the parent directory; in this case, the GID
       is set to the GID of the parent directory (see  and  Files
       created on filesystems that are not mounted with the grpid
       option will obey BSD semantics; that is, the GID is uncon-
       ditionally  inherited  from  that of the parent directory.
       Allow keyboard interrupts to kill a process that  is  hung
       while waiting for a response on a hard-mounted filesystem.

                                                                1

mount(1Mnfs)                                         mount(1Mnfs)

       Set the maximum number of  asynchronous  I/O  threads  for
       this mount point to n threads. The default is 4.  Suppress
       attribute caching.  The server IP port number. The default
       is  NFS_PORT.   Allow  mounting from pre-SVR4.0 systems or
       other older implementations. This option  should  be  used
       when the  server does not allow a client user to belong to
       more than eight groups. If the pre4.0 option is  not  used
       with  such  a  server,  the mount command will fail on the
       client and the following message will display: nfs  mount:
       server:path server not responding:

       RPC:  Authentication  error;  why = Invalid client creden-
       tial.  Specifies a transport  provider  (netid).   If  not
       specified,  mount  defaults  to  connectionless  transport
       (udp).  Note that tcp is  not  currently  supported  as  a
       transport provider.  Mount a remote filesystem shared as a
       publicly-accessible WebNFS directory.  If a filesystem  is
       mounted  read-only,  remounts  the  filesystem read-write.
       Set the number of  retransmissions to n for  soft  mounts.
       The  default is 5.  The number of times to retry the mount
       operation. The default is 10000.  Set the read buffer size
       to  n  bytes. The default is 8192.  server:path is mounted
       read-write or read-only. The default is rw.   Use  a  more
       secure  protocol  for  transactions.  (NFSv3 only.) Speci-
       fies how long to cache symbolic  link  target  paths.  The
       default  period  is  30  seconds.  A  value of 0 turns off
       caching.  Return an error if the server does not  respond,
       or  continue  the retry request until the server responds.
       The default is hard.  Execution of setuid allowed or  dis-
       allowed.  The  default  is  suid.   Set  the  timeout to n
       tenths of a second. The default is 10.  Specifies the ver-
       sion  of  NFS  (v2  or v3) that should be used. mount will
       only attempt to use the specified version of NFS.   If  no
       version  is  specified,  mount  first  uses  NFSv3, and if
       unsuccessful, retries using NFSv2.  Set the  write  buffer
       size to n bytes. The default is 8192.  The following argu-
       ments are applicable to the  -specific  mount  and  umount
       commands:  Where server is the machine that has the remote
       resource and path is the pathname of  the  resource.   The
       name  of the local directory where the remote resource has
       been mounted.

        Filesystems mounted with  the  bg  option  indicate  that
       mount  is to retry as a background process if the server's
       mount daemon, does not respond. mount retries the  request
       up to the count specified in the retry=n option.

       Once  the filesystem is mounted, each  request made in the
       kernel waits timeo=n tenths of a second for a response. If
       no  response  arrives, the time-out is multiplied by 2 and
       the request is retransmitted. When the number of  retrans-
       missions has reached the number specified in the retrans=n

                                                                2

       option, a filesystem mounted with the soft option  returns
       an  error on the request; one mounted with the hard option
       prints a  warning  message  and  continues  to  retry  the
       request. If an  server is down, a process trying to access
       a filesystem from that server mounted with the hard option
       will hang until the server comes up again.

        Filesystems  that  are mounted rw (read-write) should use
       the hard option. If the server goes down when  a  user  is
       writing  a  file,  the  write will continue when the serve
       comes back up, and the data  being  written  will  not  be
       lost.

       The attribute cache retains file attributes on the client.
       Attributes for a file are assigned a time  to  be  flushed
       (updated).  If the file is modified before the flush time,
       then the flush time is extended by the time since the last
       modification (under the assumption that files that changed
       recently are likely to change soon). There  is  a  minimum
       and maximum flush time extension for regular files and for
       directories.  Setting actimeo=n extends flush  time  by  n
       seconds for both regular files and directories.

       If  mountpoint  has any contents prior to the mount opera-
       tion, the contents remain hidden until the server:path  is
       once  again  unmounted.  If  server:path  is listed in the
       vfstab  file,  the  command  line   can   specify   either
       server:path  or  mountpoint, and mount will consult vfstab
       for  more  information.   If  the  directory  on  which  a
       filesystem  is  to  be  mounted  is  a  symbolic link, the
       filesystem is mounted on the directory to which  the  sym-
       bolic link refers, rather than being mounted on top of the
       symbolic link itself.  Only a privileged user can  execute
       these commands.

       Applications  may  experience unexpected or unreproducible
       errors if they access
        filesystems that have been mounted using the soft  option
       or  the  hard,intr  option  combination. It is recommended
       that you do not specify either soft or intr when  mounting
       filesystems  that  are writable or that contain executable
       files.

       If you are mounting resources on a  slow  machine  from  a
       much  faster  server,  it  is  advised  that  you  use the
       rsize=1024,wsize=1024 mount options. This is because  fast
       servers  can cause data overruns on the network adapter of
       slow client machines. One symptom of this problem has  the
       following  message  being  written  to  the console of the
       client machines: RPC: Timed out Another  symptom  of  this
       problem may be that the client machine appears to be hung,
       with the following message being written to the console of
       the  client  machine:  NFS server hostname not responding,
       still trying When a single file is mounted over , it  can-
       not  be opened with the O_CREAT flag.  See for information
       on O_CREAT.

       The -F nfs option  specified  in  these  examples  is  not
       strictly  required  and  could be omitted.  Here it serves
       merely as a reminder of the filesystem type.  To  mount  a
       remote  filesystem: mount -F nfs serv:/usr/src /usr/src To
       soft mount a remote  filesystem:  mount  -F  nfs  -o  soft
       serv:/usr/src  /usr/src To hard mount a remote filesystem:
       mount -F nfs -o hard serv:/usr/src  /usr/src  To  mount  a
       filesystem  with  rsize set to 1024 bytes: mount -F nfs -o
       rsize=1024 serv:/usr/src /usr/src To  mount  a  filesystem
       and  allow  the  mount command to only be retried 3 times:
       mount -F nfs -o retry=3 serv:/usr/src /usr/src To mount  a
       remote   filesystem   using  mount  -F  nfs  -o  proto=xxx
       serv:/usr/src /usr/src To unmount a remote filesystem with
       server:path umount serv:/usr/src where serv is the name of
       the server and /usr/src is the name of the path.

       To unmount a  remote  filesystem  with  mountpoint  umount
       /usr/src  where  /usr/src is the mountpoint of the mounted
       resource.
