       The  biod  command  starts the asynchronous block I/O dae-
       mons. This command is used on an  client to  buffer  read-
       ahead and write-behind.

UUssaaggee
       The biod daemons are automatically invoked in run level 3.

       biod uses kernel lightweight processes (LWPs)  to  do  the
       asynchronous   I/O. The kernel LWPs are created or deleted
       dynamically, depending on the asynchronous I/O load.   The
       maximum number of LWPs is controlled by the kernel tunable
       NFS_ASYNC_MAX.

       Only a privileged user can start the biod daemons.
