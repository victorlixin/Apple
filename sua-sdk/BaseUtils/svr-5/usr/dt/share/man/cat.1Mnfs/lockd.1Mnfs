       The lockd command processes lock requests that are  either
       sent  locally  by  the  kernel or remotely by another lock
       daemon. lockd forwards lock requests for  remote  data  to
       the  server site's lock daemon through RPC/XDR. lockd then
       requests the status monitor daemon, for  monitor  service.
       The reply to the lock request will not be sent to the ker-
       nel until the status daemon and  the  server  site's  lock
       daemon have replied.

       If  either the status monitor or server site's lock daemon
       is unavailable, the reply to a  lock  request  for  remote
       data is delayed until all daemons become available.

       When  a  server  recovers, it waits for a grace period for
       all client-site lock daemons to submit  reclaim  requests.
       Client-site  lock daemons, on the other hand, are notified
       by the status monitor daemon of the  server  recovery  and
       promptly  resubmit  previously granted lock requests. If a
       lock daemon fails to secure a previously granted  lock  at
       the server site, then it sends SIGLOST to a process.

       The  lockd daemon is automatically invoked in run level 3.

       Only a privileged user can execute this command.

       The following options are available to the lockd  command:
       Start  lockd  using  all  available  transports.   Turn on
       debugging.  Use graceperiod seconds as  the  grace  period
       duration  instead  of the default value (25 seconds).  Use
       hashsize buckets in the hash table  used  to  keep  client
       handles.   Start  lockd  only  using  the UnixWare network
       selection protocol specified  by  proto.   Report  sharing
       conflicts.  Use timeout seconds as the interval instead of
       the default value (25 seconds) to retransmit lock  request
       to  the  remote server.  Start lockd only using the device
       specified by provider.
