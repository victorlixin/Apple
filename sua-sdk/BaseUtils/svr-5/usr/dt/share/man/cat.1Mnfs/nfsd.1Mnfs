       The  nfsd  command  starts  the daemons that handle client
       filesystem requests.

   OOppttiioonnss
       The nfsd command takes the following options: Start nfsd's
       over  all  available  transports.   Start  nfsd's over the
       specified protocol.  Start nfsd's for the transport speci-
       fied by transport.

FFiilleess
       Client  machine  pointer  to an open-but-unlinked file (in
       the same directory as the original file).

UUssaaggee
       The nfsd daemons are automatically invoked in run level 3.

       One  nfsd daemon exists for each networking protocol. Each
       daemon uses kernel threads to service the  requests coming
       from  an  client  over  the transport on which it has been
       invoked. The kernel threads are created and deleted dynam-
       ically,  depending  on  the rate of incoming requests. The
       maximum and minimum number of threads  are  controlled  by
       the kernel tunables NFSD_MAX and NFSD_MIN, respectively.

       Only a privileged user can execute this command.
