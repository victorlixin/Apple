       The  exportfs  command makes a local directory or filename
       available for mounting over the network by  clients.

       All. Export all pathnames listed in /etc/dfs/dfstab, or if
       -u  is  also  specified,  unexport  all  of  the currently
       exported    pathnames.     Ignore    the    options     in
       /etc/dfs/dfstab.    Normally,    exportfs   will   consult
       /etc/dfs/dfstab  for  the  options  associated  with   the
       exported  pathname.   Unexport  the  indicated pathname. A
       pathname is required if -u is not used in conjunction with
       -a.   Verbose.  Print  each directory or filename as it is
       exported or unexported.  Specify a comma-separated list of
       optional  characteristics for the pathname being exported.
       options can be selected from among:  Export  the  pathname
       read-only.  If  not  specified,  the  pathname is exported
       read-write.  Export the pathname read-mostly.  Read-mostly
       means  exported read-only to most machines, but read-write
       to those specified. If  not  specified,  the  pathname  is
       exported  read-write  to  all.  If a request comes from an
       unknown user, use UID as  the  effective  user  ID.   root
       users (UID) are always considered ``unknown'' by the
        server,  unless  they  are  included  in  the root option
       below.  The default value for this option is  -2.  Setting
       the  value  of anon to -1 disables anonymous access.  Give
       root access only to the root users from a specified  host-
       name.   The  default  is  for  no hosts to be granted root
       access.  Give mount access to  each  client  listed.   You
       cannot  export  a  directory that is either a parent- or a
       sub-directory of one that is currently exported and within
       the same filesystem.  It would be invalid, for example, to
       export  both  /var  and  /var/spool  if  both  directories
       resided in the same disk partition.

       exportfs uses information contained in the /etc/dfs/dfstab
       file to export pathname (which must be specified as a full
       pathname). The user with appropriate administrative privi-
       leges  can  run  exportfs at any time to alter the list or
       characteristics of  exported  directories  and  filenames.
       Directories  and  files  that  are  currently exported are
       listed in the file /etc/dfs/sharetab.

       With no options or arguments, exportfs prints out the list
       of directories and filenames currently exported.
