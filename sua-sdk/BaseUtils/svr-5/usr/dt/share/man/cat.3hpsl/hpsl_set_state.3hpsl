       When  the  power  on  operation is requested, the power is
       turned on and, if a device is connected to the socket,  it
       is  configured  by the hot plug controller driver.  If the
       configuration fails for any reason, the  power  is  turned
       off by the hot plug controller driver.

       When  the  power  off  operation is requested, the devices
       connected to the socket must not have any driver bindings.

       The  attention LED is simply turned on or off according to
       the user request.

       The new state information is available in  the  socketCur-
       rentState member of the socketInfo structure.
