       The  HPSL  populates its internal data structures with the
       information about all the suspended  driver  instances  in
       the  system.  It then copies the location of this informa-
       tion in suspDrvInfo.  The HPSL allocates  memory  for  all
       structures in the array.  total number of suspended driver
       instances in the system, which corresponds to  the  number
       of structures that are available through suspDrvInfo.

       The  HPSL  populates  its  internal  data  structures with
       information about all suspended driver  instances  in  the
       system.   /*(L<hpsl_get_suspended_drvlist/*(L> then copies
       the location of this information into the location identi-
       fied by the suspDrvInfo argument.

       The  HPSL  allocates memory for all suspDrvInfo structures
       in the array.  Every new call to  this  function  rebuilds
       the suspended driver instance list and frees up the memory
       that was previously allocated for the  suspDrvInfo  struc-
       ture.
