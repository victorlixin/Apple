       getmet is  an  SNMP  application  that  retrieves  routing
       information  from an entity by traversing the ipRouteDest,
       ipRouteMetric1,   ipRouteMetric2,   ipRouteMetric3,    and
       ipRouteMetric4  variable classes for each subnet found. It
       takes as arguments the address of the SNMP entity, a  com-
       munity  string  to  provide  access  to  that entity, and,
       optionally, a net or subnet address qualifier. Only  those
       portions  of the routing table which match the net or sub-
       net address qualifier are retrieved. For example,  if  one
       were  to  enter:  getmet myagent top-secret 192.244 getmet
       would retrieve all entries beginning with 192.244.   Simi-
       larly,  getmet myagent top-secret 128.139.4 would retrieve
       all entries beginning with 128.139.4. Finally, getmet mya-
       gent top-secret would retrieve the entire routing table.
