       The  snmp command is used to start or stop the Simple Net-
       work Management Protocol (SNMP) software.

       This command should be run in either of the following  two
       ways:  sh  /etc/init.d/snmp start sh /etc/init.d/snmp stop
       SNMP will start automatically at system  startup  time  if
       /etc/init.d/snmp   is   linked  to  /etc/rc2.d/Snsnmp.  By
       default, n is installed as 73.

       SNMP will stop automatically at system  shutdown  time  if
       /etc/init.d/snmp   is   linked  to  /etc/rc1.d/Knsnmp.  By
       default, n is installed as 67.

       See and for further information.  A transport service  for
       SNMP must be initialized before SNMP is started.
