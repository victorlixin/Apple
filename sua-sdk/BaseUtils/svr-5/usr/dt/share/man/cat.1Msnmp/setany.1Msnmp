       The  setany  command does a GET request to get the current
       values of the objects to  be  set,  then  performs  a  SET
       request on the objects.

       The  options  and arguments are: The entity address can be
       either an IP address or entity  name  (if  name-to-address
       resolution is enabled).  The community string used must be
       valid on the given entity. On &gemini;, community  strings
       are  kept in /etc/netmgt/snmpd.comm.  The argument is used
       to specify a file containing  the  and  compiled  list  of
       object  names  and  their  numeric  Object Identifiers, in
       addition to the objects in the standard MIB.  This  allows
       the user to dynamically augment the number of objects that
       can be recognized by the  management  utility.   Specifies
       the number of seconds the command will wait for a response
       from the entity specified by address.  If  not  specified,
       this  defaults  to  20  seconds.  One or more triplets for
       each object to be set, consisting of the object name, fol-
       lowed  by  a dash and a flag, followed by a value.  Object
       names must refer to  a  valid  SNMP  object  or  class  of
       objects.  Object names can be in the form of an identifier
       or the equivalent SNMP dot-notation. Identifiers for &gem-
       ini;  SNMP objects are listed in Equivalent SNMP dot-nota-
       tion for these objects is defined in the  files  /etc/net-
       mgt/nwumpsd.defs,  /etc/netmgt/snmpd.defs,  and  /etc/net-
       mgt/unixwared.defs. (For a  general  explanation  of  SNMP
       dot-notation, see RFC 1213.)

       The  available  flags are: The object is an IP address (in
       dot notation); value is specified in decimal number in  IP
       address   format   (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx).   The  object  is  a
       counter; value is specified as  a  decimal  integer.   The
       object is an object identifier (in dot notation); value is
       specified as a decimal OID (see RFC 1213).  The object  is
       a  gauge;  value  is  specified as a decimal integer.  The
       object is an integer; value  is  specified  as  a  decimal
       integer.   The  object is a null value; value is specified
       as 0.  The object is an octet string; value  is  specified
       as a hexadecimal number.  The object is a string; value is
       specified as a character  string  enclosed  within  double
       quotes.   The  object  is  in clock-ticks (hundredths of a
       second); value is specified as  a  decimal  integer.   The
       range  of allowable values for a particular object depends
       on how the specified object_name is  defined.  The  object
       definitions   in   the   files   /etc/netmgt/nwumpsd.defs,
       /etc/netmgt/snmpd.defs,   and   /etc/netmgt/unixwared.defs

                                                                1

       define  the  allowable  values for SNMP objects as well as
       the type of the object (which tells you what flag  to  use
       when  setting  the  object).   The actions that take place
       during a SET request are that a GET request is issued  for
       the  object. The object name returned from this request is
       used in the SET request.
