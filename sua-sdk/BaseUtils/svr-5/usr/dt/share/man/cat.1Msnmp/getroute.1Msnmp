       The getroute command is an SNMP application that retrieves
       routing information  from  an  entity  by  traversing  the
       ipRouteDest,  ipRouteIfIndex,  ipRouteMetric1, ipRouteNex-
       tHop, ipRouteType, and  ipRouteProto  object  classes  for
       each route found.

       The  arguments  are the entity's address and the community
       string for access to the SNMP entity.

       The entity address can be either an IP address  or  entity
       name (if name-to-address resolution is enabled).

       The  community  string  used  must  be  valid on the given
       entity.  On  &gemini;,  community  strings  are  kept   in
       /etc/netmgt/snmpd.comm.

       The -T option can be used to specify the number of seconds
       the command will wait for a response from the entity spec-
       ified  by  entity_addr. If not specified, this defaults to
       20 seconds.
