       The getnext command is an SNMP application that  retrieves
       one  or  more individual objects from an SNMP entity.  The
       getnext command returns the object and value pair(s)  that
       appear in the MIB database immediately after the object(s)
       specified on the commmand line.

       The arguments are  the  entity's  address,  the  community
       string  for  access  to  the  SNMP  entity, and the object
       name(s).

       The entity address can be either an IP address  or  entity
       name (if name-to-address resolution is enabled).

       The  community  string  used  must  be  valid on the given
       entity.  On  &gemini;,  community  strings  are  kept   in
       /etc/netmgt/snmpd.comm.

       Object names must refer to a valid SNMP object or class of
       objects. Object names can be in the form of an  identifier
       or the equivalent SNMP dot-notation. Identifiers for &gem-
       ini; SNMP objects are listed in Equivalent SNMP  dot-nota-
       tion  for  these objects is defined in the files /etc/net-
       mgt/nwumpsd.defs,  /etc/netmgt/snmpd.defs,  and  /etc/net-
       mgt/unixwared.defs. For a general explanation of SNMP dot-
       notation, see RFC 1213.

       If an object on the command line is a group name, then the
       object  and  value returned is the first object-value pair
       in the group.

       The -f option is used to specify a file containing the and
       compiled  list  of  object  names and their numeric Object
       Identifiers, in addition to the objects  in  the  standard
       MIB.  This allows the user to dynamically augment the num-
       ber of objects that can be recognized  by  the  management
       utility.

       The -T option can be used to specify the number of seconds
       the command will wait for a response from the entity spec-
       ified  by  entity_addr. If not specified, this defaults to
       20 seconds.

       returns the first member of each group specified.  getnext
