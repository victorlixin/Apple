       The mosy compiler reads a description of a managed objects
       module (module.my) and produces a simple ASCII file  (mod-
       ule.defs)  containing  equivalent  definitions. The output
       file is meant to be read as configuration data by  a  net-
       work management program.

       The  default  output file name is derived from the name of
       the input file (for example, if the input  file  is  named
       module.my  the output file will be named module.defs). The
       -o option overrides this behavior with the specified  out-
       put file name; if you specify a dash - with the -o option,
       the standard output is used instead of a file.

       Normally, mosy prints the name of each object, identifier,
       or type as it works. The -s option disables this behavior.

WWaarrnniinnggss
       mosy does not contain a library, so it can't check  IMPORT
       statements for validity.

       mosy   discards  the  enumerations  associated  with  ints
       (although it does perform range checking on them).

       mosy does not perform range checking on  size  constraints
       associated with ints.
