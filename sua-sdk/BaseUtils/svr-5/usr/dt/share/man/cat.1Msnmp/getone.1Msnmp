       The getone command is an SNMP application that retrieves a
       set  of individual objects from an SNMP entity using a GET
       request.

       The arguments are  the  entity's  address,  the  community
       string for access to the SNMP entity, and the fully quali-
       fied object name(s).

       The entity address can be either an IP address  or  entity
       name (if name-to-address resolution is enabled).

       The  community  string  used  must  be  valid on the given
       entity.  On  &gemini;  community  strings  are   kept   in
       /etc/netmgt/snmpd.comm.

       Variable  names must refer to a valid SNMP object or class
       of objects. Variable names can be in the form of an  iden-
       tifier  or  the  equivalent SNMP dot-notation. Identifiers
       for &gemini; SNMP objects are listed  in  Equivalent  SNMP
       dot-notation  for  these  objects  is defined in the files
       /etc/netmgt/nwumpsd.defs,   /etc/netmgt/snmpd.defs,    and
       /etc/netmgt/unixwared.defs.   For a general explanation of
       SNMP dot-notation, see RFC 1213.

       The -f option is used to specify a file containing the and
       compiled  list  of  object  names and their numeric Object
       Identifiers, in addition to the objects  in  the  standard
       MIB.  This allows the user to dynamically augment the num-
       ber of objects that can be recognized  by  the  management
       utility.

       The -T option can be used to specify the number of seconds
       the command will wait for a response from the entity spec-
       ified  by  entity_addr. If not specified, this defaults to
       20 seconds.

       Since the function is a GET, as opposed to a GET-NEXT, the
       object  must be fully qualified for the request to be suc-
       cessful.

       For instance: getone suzzy  public  sysDescr.0  ifNumber.0
       would  return  the  objects sysDescr.0 and ifNumber.0, but
       the call getone suzzy public system would return an  error
       from  the  entity,  since  system is not a fully qualified
       SNMP object.

                                                                1
