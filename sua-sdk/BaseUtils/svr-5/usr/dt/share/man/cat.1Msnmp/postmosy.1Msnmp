       The  post_mosy  program  reads the output generated by and
       produces an ASCII file containing the name and the numeric
       object  identifier of each object present in the mosy out-
       put.  This ASCII file can be read as configuration data by
       network management utilities.

       The -i option sets the name of the mosy file which will be
       used as input.

       The -o option sets the name of the output  file.  If  mod-
       ule.mib  is  set  to  -  or the -o option is omitted alto-
       gether, post_mosy writes to the standard  output.   Before
       running  post_mosy  over  the  file generated by mosy, you
       must either prepend the  object  definitions  of  selected
       nodes  to  the  mosy output, or run the shell script, mib-
       comp.sh. These object definitions  appear  on  the  manual
       page.   The  mosy  and  post_mosy  programs can be invoked
       together by running the shell script mibcomp.sh. This cre-
       ates  the configuration data used by the management utili-
       ties (such as and from multiple input files containing MIB
       definitions in ASN.1 notation.
