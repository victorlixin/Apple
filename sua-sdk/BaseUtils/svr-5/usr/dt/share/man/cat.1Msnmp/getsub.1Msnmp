       getsub is  an  SNMP  application  that  retrieves  routing
       information  from an entity by traversing the ipRouteDest,
       ipRouteIfIndex, ipRouteMetric1,  ipRouteNextHop,  ipRoute-
       Type,  and  ipRouteProto  variable  classes for ach subnet
       found. It takes as  arguments  the  address  of  the  SNMP
       entity,  a  community  string  to  provide  access to that
       entity, and, optionally, a net or  subnet  address  quali-
       fier. Only those portions of the routing table which match
       the net or subnet address  qualifier  are  retrieved.  For
       example,  if  one were to enter: getsub myagent top-secret
       192.244 getsub would retrieve all entries  beginning  with
       192.244.   Similarly,  getsub myagent top-secret 128.139.4
       would  retrieve  all  entries  beginning  with  128.139.4.
       Finally,  getsub  myagent  top-secret  would  retrieve the
       entire routing table.
