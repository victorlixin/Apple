       The  trap_send  command  sends  Simple  Network Management
       (SNMP) trap messages to trap monitoring stations.

       The  arguments  are  the  entity's  address,  a  community
       string, and an integer trap type.

       The  entity  address can be either an IP address or entity
       name (if name-to-address resolution is enabled).

       The community string is used  by  the  network  management
       software  receiving a trap to filter out specfic traps. In
       this case, the community string is not used for  authenti-
       cation purposes. For example, a particular network manage-
       ment station might be interested only in traps  sent  with
       the test1 or test2 community strings, and might ignore all
       of the traps sent with any other community string.

       The trap_type can be any integer;  since  this  is  essen-
       tially  a test program, the trap type is immaterial and is
       open to interpretation by the network management  software
       receiving the trap.

       The  primary purpose of this program is to demonstrate how
       traps are sent using the SNMP library. It can be  used  to
       test  network  management  software for correct configura-
       tion.
