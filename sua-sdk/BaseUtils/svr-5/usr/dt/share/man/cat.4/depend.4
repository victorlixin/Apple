       depend  is  an ASCII file used to specify information con-
       cerning software dependencies for  a  particular  package.
       The file is created by a software developer.

       Each  entry in the depend file describes a single software
       package.  The instance of the package is  described  after
       the  entry  line by giving the package architecture and/or
       version.  The format of each entry and subsequent instance
       definition is: type pkg name

       The fields are: Defines the dependency type.  This must be
       one of the following: Indicates a prerequisite for instal-
       lation,  for  example,  the referenced package or versions
       must be installed.  Implies  that  the  existence  of  the
       indicated package or version is incompatible. See also the
       X tag.  Implies that the existence of the indicated  pack-
       age  or  version is incompatible.  This tag should be used
       instead of the I tag.   Indicates  a  reverse  dependency.
       Instead  of  defining the package's own dependencies, this
       designates that another package depends on this one.  This
       type should be used only when an old package does not have
       a depend file but it relies on the newer package  nonethe-
       less.   Therefore,  the  present  package  should  not  be
       removed if the designated old package is still on the sys-
       tem  since,  if  it  is  removed,  the old package will no
       longer  work.   Indicates  a  superceding  dependency.  It
       should be used when an earlier package has been superceded
       by the current package.  Indicates the  package  abbrevia-
       tion.  Specifies the full package name.
