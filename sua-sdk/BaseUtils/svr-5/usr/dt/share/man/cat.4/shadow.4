       /etc/shadow is an access-restricted ASCII system file that
       contains an entry for each user on the system.  The fields
       within  each  entry are separated by colons; each entry is
       separated  from  the  next  by  a  new-line.   Unlike  the
       /etc/passwd  file,  /etc/shadow does not have general read
       permission.

       Here are the fields in /etc/shadow: The name  by  which  a
       user  identifies  himself  or  herself when logging in.  A
       13-character encrypted  password  for  the  user,  a  lock
       string  to  indicate  the  login  is not accessible, or no
       string to show that there is no password  for  the  login.
       The  number  of days between January 1, 1970, and the date
       that the password was last modified.  The  minimum  number
       of  days  required  between password changes.  The maximum
       number of days the password is valid.  The number of  days
       before password expires that the user is warned.  The num-
       ber of days of inactivity allowed for that user.  An abso-
       lute date specifying when the login may no longer be used.
       A character identifying a password generator.

       The encrypted password consists of  13  characters  chosen
       from a 64-character alphabet (., /, 0-9, A-Z, a-z).

       To  update this file, use the passwd, useradd, usermod, or
       userdel command.
