       Options  for  the login program can be set or changed with
       keywords in /etc/default/login.   The  following  keywords
       are  recognized  by  login.  Define users of the system in
       addition to root whose login access to terminals  will  be
       restricted  by  the CONSOLE keyword.  For reasons of secu-
       rity, it may be desirable to restrict access by privileged
       users such as the system owner.  Users may be specified by
       name, by ID, and by ranges of IDs  The  following  example
       defines  the  user  gemini and users with IDs 1000 through
       1999  as   being   restricted   by   CONSOLE:   USERS=gem-
       ini,1000-1999   Note  that  restricted  access  is  always
       applied to root.  If set, users defined by the USERS  key-
       word  may  only  log in on one of the terminals defined by
       the CONSOLE keyword.  The  following  example  would  only
       allow restricted users to log in on the console (/dev/con-
       sole): CONSOLE=/dev/console Multiple devices and ranges of
       devices  can  be specified, for example: CONSOLE=/dev/con-
       sole,/dev/inet/tcp000-/dev/inet/tcp999,/dev/pts000-/dev/pts255
       This  would  allow  restricted users to log in on the con-
       sole, or to log in using rlogin or telnet.

       If CONSOLE is not in /etc/default/login, or its  entry  is
       commented  out,  users may log in on any terminal.  If the
       user's shell is defined in /etc/passwd and this keyword is
       set  to  YES, the SHELL environment variable is set to the
       user's shell.  If set to  NO,  the  names  of  nonstandard
       shells are not put in the SHELL environment variable.  For
       increased security, the default value of this  keyword  is
       YES.   If set to YES, all users must have a password.  Any
       user without a password is asked  for  one  at  the  first
       opportunity  permitted  by the password aging set for that
       user.  If set to YES, all  users  must  have  a  password.
       Users  without passwords will not be able to log in at all
       (overriding PASSREQ).  This keyword sets the  TZ  variable
       in  the environment of the user.  It must match the format
       of the timezone set in /etc/TIMEZONE.  This  keyword  sets
       the environment variable HZ, the rate of the system clock,
       for the user logging in.  The default is 100.   This  key-
       word  sets  a  default path for an unprivileged user.  The
       default is /usr/bin.  This keyword sets the  default  path
       for  the privileged user logging in.  Another default path
       for the privileged user is in  /etc/default/su,  which  is
       set  for privileged users who did not log in as such.  The
       default is  /sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/etc.   This  keyword
       sets  the maximum file size for a user.  It is in units of
       512-byte blocks.  This keyword is the  default  umask  for
       users.  The default is 077.  This keyword is the number of
       weeks an account may remain idle before its login is  dis-
       abled.   A  user's account will be disabled if their pass-
       word is forcibly changed and the  value  of  IDLEWEEKS  is
       null  or  0.   To  correct  this, set IDLEWEEKS to a value
       greater than 0 or remove  it  from  the  file  altogether.
       This keyword is the length of time, in seconds, that login

                                                                1

       waits for a password after receiving  a  user  name.   The
       default  is  60.   This keyword sets the maximum number of
       login attempts permitted.  The default is 5.  This keyword
       sets  the number of consecutive failed login attempts that
       are permitted before a record is written to the  log  file
       (see The default is 5.  See also the descriptions of LOCK-
       ONLOGFAIL and MAILONLOGFAIL.  When set  to  YES,  lock  an
       account  when  the  number  of  consecutive  failed  login
       attempts  reaches  the  limit  set  by  LOGFAILURES.   The
       default  value  is  NO  which  prevents  the account being
       locked for this reason.  If LOCKONLOGFAIL is set  to  YES,
       this  keyword  defines the mail address(es) of the user(s)
       who should be notified when an account is  locked  because
       of   too   many  failed  login  attempts.   Multiple  mail
       addresses should be specified as a  comma-separated  list.
       If  undefined  or  set  to  null,  mail is sent to root by
       default.  If LOCKONLOGFAIL is set to NO, no mail is  sent.
       This  keyword  sets  the  number of seconds to sleep after
       MAXTRYS or LOGFAILURES failed logins.  The default is  20.
       This  keyword  sets  the number of seconds to sleep before
       printing an error message.  The default is 1.   This  key-
       word  is  the  pathname  of a regular, non-executable file
       containing a site-specific message to  a  user  without  a
       password,  asking  that  user  to  pick  a  password.  The
       default message is Choose one.  This keyword  is  used  to
       delay  the  exit from the login process, for the specified
       number of seconds, so the user logging in has time to read
       messages  before  the screen is cleared.  Its value can be
       set to any number between 0 and 10; the default  value  is
       0.   (If  you  try  to  assign  a  value  greater than the
       default--10--the value will be set to 10.)   This  keyword
       sets  the  highest  level  allowed to log in to the system
       (when the MAC feature is installed).   This  keyword  sets
       the lowest level allowed to log in to the system (when the
       MAC feature is installed).
