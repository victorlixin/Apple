       FsTable  is  a  list of file system types from which users
       can choose to make file systems on a  floppy.  Each  entry
       includes  the  name of the file system (for example, Veri-
       tas) and the attribute (for example, mkvxfscmd)  that  can
       be  found  in  the /etc/device.tab file. The MediaMgr will
       use this attribute to locate the actual  system command to
       make the file system on the floppy.

       The  entry  on  the FsTable list has the following format:
       messageFiles:messageNumber:defaultLabel<tab>attribute
       Users  can  add  more entries to this table, provided they
       also include the corresponding attribute=value pair in the
       /etc/device.tab file.

       For  example,  to make an s5 file system through the Medi-
       aMgr, users need to add the  following  line  to  FsTable:
       dtmedia:401:s5 mkfscmd  To  make the s5 file system, users
       also need to have the following  attribute=value  pair  in
       the   /etc/device.tab   file:  mkfscmd="/sbin/mkfs  -F  s5
