       A  directory  behaves  exactly like an ordinary file, save
       that no user may write into a directory.  The fact that  a
       file is a directory is indicated by a bit in the mode word
       of its i-node entry [see the s5-specific The structure  of
       a directory entry as given in the include file is: #ifndef
       DIRSIZ #define  DIRSIZ  14 #endif struct direct {
            o_ino_t    d_ino;   /* s5 inode type */
            char       d_name[DIRSIZ]; };

       By convention, the first two entries in each directory are
       .  for  the  entry itself and .. for the parent directory.
       The meaning of .. is modified for the  root  directory  of
       the  master file system; there is no parent, so .. has the
       same meaning as . has.
