       The  archive command is used to combine several files into
       one.  Archives are used mainly as libraries to be searched
       by the link editor

       Each archive begins with a unique string identifier called
       an archive magic string.  #define  ARMAG   "!<arch>\n"  /*
       magic string */ #define  SARMAG  8            /* length of
       magic string */

       Following the archive magic string are  the  archive  file
       members.   Each  file  member is preceded by a file member
       header which is of the following format:  #define   ARFMAG
       "`\n"      /* header trailer string */

       struct  ar_hdr                /* file member header */ {
           char     ar_name[16];      /* '/' terminated file mem-
       ber name */
           char    ar_date[12];      /* file member date */
           char    ar_uid[6];        /* file member user  identi-
       fication */
           char    ar_gid[6];        /* file member group identi-
       fication */
           char    ar_mode[8];       /* file member mode  (octal)
       */
           char    ar_size[10];      /* file member size */
           char     ar_fmag[2];       /* header trailer string */
       };

       All information in the file member headers is in printable
       ASCII.   The  numeric information contained in the headers
       is stored as decimal numbers (except for ar_mode which  is
       in octal).  Thus, if the archive contains printable files,
       the archive itself is printable.

       If the file member name fits, the ar_name  field  contains
       the  name  directly,  and is terminated by a slash (/) and
       padded with blanks on the right.   If  the  member's  name
       does  not  fit, ar_name contains a slash (/) followed by a
       decimal representation of the name's offset in the archive
       string table described below.

       The  ar_date field is the modification date of the file at
       the time of its insertion into the archive.  Common format
       archives can be moved from system to system as long as the
       portable archive command ar is used.

       Each archive file member begins on an even byte  boundary;
       a  newline is inserted between files if necessary.  Never-
       theless, the size given reflects the actual  size  of  the
       file exclusive of padding.

                                                                1

ar(4)                                                       ar(4)

       Notice there is no provision for empty areas in an archive
       file.

       Each archive that contains object files [see  includes  an
       archive  symbol  table.   This symbol table is used by the
       link editor ld to determine which archive members must  be
       loaded  during  the link edit process.  The archive symbol
       table (if it exists) is  always  the  first  file  in  the
       archive (but is never listed) and is automatically created
       and/or updated by ar.

       The archive symbol table has a zero length name (that  is,
       ar_name[0]  is  '/'),  ar_name[1]=='  ',  and so on).  All
       ``words'' in this symbol table have four bytes, using  the
       machine-independent  encoding  shown below.  (All machines
       use the encoding described here for the symbol table, even
       if the machine's ``natural'' byte order is different.)
       --------------------------------

                 |    |    |    |     |
                 |    | ---+----+-----+-------

       The  contents of the symbol table are as follows: The num-
       ber of symbols.  Length: 4 bytes.  The array  of  offsets,
       one  per symbol, into the archive file.  Length: 4 bytes *
       ``the  number  of  symbols''.   The  name  string   table.
       Length:  ar_size  - 4 bytes * (``the number of symbols'' +
       1).

       As an example, the following symbol table defines  4  sym-
       bols.   The archive member at file offset 114 defines name
       and object.  The archive member at file offset 426 defines
       function and a second version of name.

       The number of symbols and the array of offsets are managed
       with sgetl and sputl.  The string table  contains  exactly
       as  many  null terminated strings as there are elements in
       the offsets array.  Each offset from the array is  associ-
       ated with the corresponding name from the string table (in
       order).  The names in the string table are all the defined
       global  symbols  found  in  the common object files in the
       archive.  Each offset  is  the  location  of  the  archive
       header for the associated symbol.

       If  some archive member's name is more than 15 bytes long,
       a special archive member contains a table of  file  names,
       each  followed  by  a  slash  and a new-line.  This string
       table member, if  present,  will  precede  all  ``normal''
       archive  members.  The special archive symbol table is not
       a ``normal'' member, and must be first if it exists.   The
       ar_name  entry of the string table's member header holds a
       zero length name ar_name[0]=='/', followed by one trailing
       slash     (ar_name[1]=='/'),     followed     by    blanks
       (ar_name[2]==' ', and so on).   Offsets  into  the  string
       table begin at zero.  Example ar_name values for short and
       long file names appear below.
