       pkginfo  is  an ASCII file that describes the characteris-
       tics of the package along with information that helps con-
       trol the flow of installation.  It is created by the soft-
       ware package developer.

       Each entry in the pkginfo file is a line that  establishes
       the   value   of   a  parameter  in  the  following  form:
       PARAM="value"

       There is no required order in which the parameters must be
       specified  within  the  file.  Each parameter is described
       below.  Only fields marked with an asterisk are mandatory.
       PKG  is  the parameter to which you assign an abbreviation
       for the name of the package being installed.  The abbrevi-
       ation must be a short string (no more than nine characters
       long) and it must conform to file naming rules.  All char-
       acters  in  the  abbreviation must be alphanumeric and the
       first cannot  be  numeric.   install,  new,  and  all  are
       reserved  abbreviations.   Text that specifies the package
       name (maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).   A  comma-
       separated  list  of  alphanumeric tokens that indicate the
       architecture (for example, ARCH=m68k,i386) associated with
       the  package.  The pkgmk(1M) tool can be used to create or
       modify this value when actually building the package.  The
       maximum  length  of a token is 16 characters and it cannot
       include a comma.  Text that specifies the current  version
       associated  with the software package.  The maximum length
       is 256 ASCII characters and the first character cannot  be
       a  left parenthesis.  The pkgmk tool can be used to create
       or modify this value when actually building  the  package.
       A comma-separated list of categories under which a package
       can be displayed.  There are  six  categories:  ``applica-
       tion,''  ``graphics,'' ``system,'' ``utilities,'' ``set,''
       and ``patch.''  If you choose, you can also assign a pack-
       age to one or more categories that you define.  Categories
       are case-insensitive and can contain  only  alphanumerics.
       Each category is limited in length to 16 characters.

       For a Set Installation Package (SIP), this field must have
       the value ``set.''  A SIP is  a  special  purpose  package
       that controls the installation of a set of packages.  Text
       that describes the package (maximum length  of  256  ASCII
       characters).   Used  to identify the vendor that holds the
       software copyright (maximum length of  256  ASCII  charac-
       ters).   Phone number and/or mailing address where further
       information can be received or bugs can be reported (maxi-
       mum  length  of  256  ASCII  characters).   An  electronic
       address where further information is available or bugs can
       be reported (maximum length of 256 ASCII characters).  The
       vendor stock number, if any, that identifies this  product
       (maximum  length  of 256 ASCII characters).  A space-sepa-
       rated list of classes defined for a package.  The order of
       the  list  determines  the  order in which the classes are

                                                                1

       installed.  Classes listed first will be  installed  first
       (on a medium-by-medium basis).  This parameter can be mod-
       ified by the request script.  In  this  way,  the  request
       script  can be used to select which classes in the package
       get installed on the system.   A  list  of  allowable  run
       states for package installation (for example, "S s 1").  A
       list of allowable run  states  for  package  removal  (for
       example,  "S  s  1").  The pathname to a default directory
       where ``relocatable'' files can be installed.  If  BASEDIR
       is    not    specified    and    basedir   in   the   file
       (/var/sadm/install/admin/default) is set to default,  then
       BASEDIR  is  set  to  /  by default.  An administrator can
       override the value of BASEDIR by setting  basedir  in  the
       admin  file.  If set, this parameter is passed as an argu-
       ment to the ulimit command, which establishes the  maximum
       size  of  a  file  during installation.  A list of classes
       defining the order in which they  should  be  put  on  the
       medium.    Used  by  pkgmk(1)  in  creating  the  package.
       Classes not defined in this field are placed on the medium
       using  the standard ordering procedures.  Production stamp
       used to mark the pkgmap(4) file  on  the  output  volumes.
       Provides  a  means  for  distinguishing between production
       copies of a version if more than one is in use at a  time.
       If  PSTAMP  is  not  defined,  the  default  is used.  The
       default consists of the

       system machine name followed by  the  string  "YYMMDDHHmm"
       (year,  month,  date,  hour, minutes).  Indicates that the
       package should be installed interactively only when set to
       any  non-NULL  value.  Used to maintain compatibility with
       dependency checking on  packages  delivered  earlier  than
       System  V Release 4.  Pre-Release 4 dependency checks were
       based on whether or not the name  file  for  the  required
       package  existed  in  the  /usr/options  directory.   This
       directory is not maintained for Release 4 and later  pack-
       ages  because  the depend file is used for checking depen-
       dencies.  However, entries can be created in  this  direc-
       tory  to  maintain  compatibility.  This is done automati-
       cally by pkgmk.  This field is to be assigned the  package
       instance  name  of  the package.  A serial number, if any,
       that uniquely identifies this copy of the package (maximum
       length  of  256 ASCII characters).  Activation key indica-
       tor.  Set to YES  indicates  that  an  activation  key  is
       required  to  install the package.  A list of the products
       to which each package belongs.  The format of  this  vari-
       able is: PRODUCTNAME="<product>[|<product>| . . . ]"

       Developers can define their own installation parameters by
       adding a definition to  this  file.   A  developer-defined
       parameter should begin with a capital letter.

       Restrictions  placed  on a package installation by certain
       variables  in  the  pkginfo  file  can  be  overridden  by
       instructions in the file.  For example, the restriction of
       allowable run states set by the ISTATES  variable  can  be
       overridden  by  having  runlevel=nocheck in the admin file
       being used for installation.  (Default is  default.)   See
       for further information.
