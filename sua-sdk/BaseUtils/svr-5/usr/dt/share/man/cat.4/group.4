       The group file describes each group of users recognized by
       the system.

UUssaaggee
       For each group, the group file contains a  one-line  entry
       of the form: groupname:password:gid:user-list

       where:  is  the name of the group is the group's numerical
       ID within the system; it must be unique is  a  comma-sepa-
       rated list of users allowed in the group

       The group file is an ASCII file.  The fields are separated
       by colons; each group is separated from the next by a new-
       line.

       A  group  entry  beginning  with a + (plus sign), means to
       incorporate an entry or entries from the Network  Informa-
       tion Service (NIS) into the local /etc/group file.  A + on
       a line itself means to insert the entire contents  of  the
       NIS  group file at that point in the local file.  An entry
       of the form +groupname means to insert the NIS  entry  (if
       any)  for  that  group name.  If a +groupname entry has an
       empty password or user-list field, the fields in  the  NIS
       entry will used to fill in the corresponding fields in the
       local entry.  The group ID in the NIS entry will never  be
       used.

       An  entry  of the form -groupname indicates that the group
       is disallowed.  All  subsequent  entries  for  that  group
       name, whether in the NIS group file, or in the local group
       file are ignored.

       If the password field is empty, no password is demanded.

       Because of the encrypted passwords, the group file can and
       does  have  general  read  permission and can be used, for
       example, to map numerical group ID to names.

       During user identification and authentication, the supple-
       mentary group access list is initialized sequentially from
       information in this file.  If a user  is  in  more  groups
       than  the system is configured for, {NGROUPS_MAX}, a warn-
       ing will be given and subsequent group specifications will
       be ignored.

       When  the Network Information Service (NIS) is in use, the
       local /etc/group file is consulted first, then the NIS map
       group.bygid or group.byname on the NIS server.

                                                                1

       Corresponding  NIS  map containing group security informa-
       tion.  The group ID is  the  key  in  the  map.   Same  as
       group.bygid, except key is group name instead of group ID.
