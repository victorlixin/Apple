       The  sched.h  header  defines  the  sched_param structure,
       which contains  the  scheduling  parameters  required  for
       implementation  of  each supported scheduling policy. This
       structure contains at  least  the  following  member:  int
       sched_priority    process execution scheduling priority

       Each  process  is  controlled  by an associated scheduling
       policy and priority.  Associated with  each  policy  is  a
       priority range.  Each policy definition specifies the min-
       imum priority range for that policy.  The priority  ranges
       for  each  policy may overlap the priority ranges of other
       policies.

       Three scheduling policies are defined.  The three standard
       policies are indicated by the values of the following sym-
       bolic constants: First in-first out (FIFO) scheduling pol-
       icy.   Round  robin scheduling policy.  Another scheduling
       policy.

       The values of these constants are distinct.

       The following is declared as a function and  may  also  be
       declared as macros.  int    sched_yield(void);

       Inclusion  of the sched.h header will make visible symbols
       defined in the header time.h.
