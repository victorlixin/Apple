       /etc/dfs/lid_and_priv  is the Distributed Filesystem (DFS)
       security database. It acts as a mechanism that allows net-
       work  administrators  to  control  access  to  RFS and NFS
       resources on a server.

       File  entries  have  the   format   domainname    hostname
       level_name   priv_list where: Indicates the name of an RFS
       client's domain. A dash (-) in the  field  indicates  that
       the  domain is the same as the server's local domain.  The
       domainname  field  is  ignored  by  NFS.   Indicates   the
       client's  machine  name.  Indicates the security label, or
       its alias, assigned to requests from a client. A dash  (-)
       in the level_name field indicates the default behavior.  A
       comma-separated list of privileges that  the  server  will
       accept from the client. If the network administrator wants
       to accept the same privileges assigned to the  process  on
       the  client  side, then the field should contain the entry
       allprivs. See the manual page for a complete list of priv-
       ileges and their meanings.  The special character * can be
       used in a file entry to set  up  new  default  values.  By
       specifying  *  in  the domainname and hostname fields, the
       network administrator indicates that  the  values  in  the
       level_name  and priv_list fields in that same entry are to
       be  used  as  defaults,  overriding   the   system-defined
       defaults.

       The dash special character (-) is a placeholder. It can be
       used in a file entry in  either  or  both  of  the  fields
       level_name and priv_list to indicate that the label and/or
       privileges assigned to the client  are  the  same  as  the
       defaults.

       The  contents of lid_and_priv must be loaded into the ker-
       nel whenever changes are  made  to  the  file.  A  network
       administrator loads the contents of the file into the ker-
       nel by running the command.   When  lidload  in  run,  all
       changes   in  the  database  immediately  affect  all  NFS
       resources. All RFS resources are affected  immediately  as
       well,  with  the exception of those with open files, which
       are affected once the files are closed and re-opened.

       It is possible for the same RFS client to have  more  than
       one  entry  in lid_and_priv, with a different domain indi-
       cated in each entry.  NFS clients  should  have  only  one
       entry  each. If an NFS client has two entries in the file,
       a warning message is printed and NFS acts on the  informa-
       tion in the first entry.

                                                                1
