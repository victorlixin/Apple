       These  files contain mail addresses or aliases, recognized
       by for the local host: Mail addresses (usernames) of local
       users.   Aliases for the local host, in ASCII format. This
       file can be edited to add, update, or  delete  local  mail
       aliases.  The aliasing information from /etc/mail/aliases,
       in binary, dbm format  for  use  by  sendmail.   maintains
       these files.  In addition, the Network Information Service
       (NIS) provides two mail alias maps for use across the net-
       work.

       As  distributed,  sendmail supports the following types of
       addresses: Local usernames: Each local username is  listed
       in  the  local  host's /etc/passwd file.  Local filenames:
       Messages addressed to the absolute pathname of a file  are
       appended  to  that file.  Commands: If the first character
       of the address is a vertical bar (|), sendmail  pipes  the
       message  to the standard input of the command the bar pre-
       cedes.  Include files: The aliases in pathname  are  added
       to  the  aliases for name.  E-mail addresses (RFC 822 for-
       mat): If domain does not contain  any  dots,  then  it  is
       interpreted  as  the name of a host in the current domain.
       Otherwise, the message is passed to  a  ``mailhost''  that
       determines how to get to the specified domain. Domains are
       divided into subdomains separated by dots, with  the  top-
       level domain on the right. Top-level domains include: com-
       mercial organizations educational organizations government
       organizations military organizations

       For  example,  the  full  address  of John Smith could be:
       js@jsmachine.Podunk-U.EDU if he  uses  the  machine  named
       jsmachine at Podunk University.
        addresses:  .  .  . [host!] host!username These are some-
       times mistakenly referred to as ``Usenet'' addresses.
        provides links to numerous sites throughout the world for
       the remote copying of files.

       Other  site-specific  forms  of addressing can be added by
       customizing the sendmail configuration file. See the  man-
       ual  page for details. Standard addresses are recommended.

       sendmail supports the following types  of  aliases:  Local
       aliases:

       /etc/mail/aliases is formatted as a series of lines of the
       form: aliasname:address[, address] aliasname is  the  name
       of the alias or alias group, and address is the address of
       a recipient in the group. Aliases can be nested. That  is,
       an address can be the name of another alias group. Because

                                                                1

aliases(4)                                             aliases(4)

       of the way sendmail performs mapping  from  upper-case  to
       lower-case,  an  address that is the name of another alias
       group must not contain any upper-case letters.

       Lines beginning with white space are treated as  continua-
       tion lines for the preceding alias. Lines beginning with a
       hash sign (#) are comments.  Special aliases:

       An alias of the form: owner- aliasname :  address  directs
       error-messages   resulting   from  mail  to  aliasname  to
       address, instead of back to the person who sent  the  mes-
       sage.

       An  alias  of  the form: aliasname: :include:pathname with
       colons as shown, adds the recipients listed  in  the  file
       pathname  to  the  aliasname  alias. This allows a private
       list to be maintained separately from  the  aliases  file.
       NIS domain aliases:

       Normally,  the  aliases  maps on the master NIS server are
       used for the mail.aliases  NIS  map,  which  can  be  made
       available  to  every  NIS  client.  With  NIS,  the  local
       /etc/mail/aliases file is consulted first, then  the  maps
       on  the  NIS server. Thus, the /etc/mail/aliases* files on
       the various hosts in a network will one day  be  obsolete.
       Domain-wide  aliases  should  ultimately  be resolved into
       usernames on specific hosts. For example, if the following
       were  in  the  domain-wide alias file: jsmith:js@jsmachine
       then any NIS client could just mail to jsmith and not have
       to remember the machine and username for John Smith.  If a
       NIS alias does not resolve to an address with  a  specific
       host,  then  the  name  of  the  NIS domain is used. There
       should be an alias of the domain name for a host  in  this
       case.  For example, the alias: jsmith:root sends mail on a
       NIS client to root@podunk-u if the name of the NIS  domain
       is podunk-u.

       Corresponding   NIS   map   containing  aliases  and  mail
       addresses.  The alias is the key  in  the  map.   Same  as
       mail.aliases, except key is mail address instead of alias.
