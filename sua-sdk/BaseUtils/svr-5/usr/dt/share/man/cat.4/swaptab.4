       The  file  /etc/swaptab  lists  all the swap devices to be
       configured in the system.  When the system is booted, this
       file  will be used for configuring swap devices.  The for-
       mat     of     the      file      is      as      follows:
       device_name    start_offset   size

       device_name   should   be   specified  by  full  pathname,
       start_offset (in blocks) specifies the offset  from  which
       swap  will  start, and size specifies the size (in blocks)
       of the device that can be used for swapping.  A minus sign
       (-)  can  be  used  in  the  size field to denote that the
       entire device can be used for swapping.
