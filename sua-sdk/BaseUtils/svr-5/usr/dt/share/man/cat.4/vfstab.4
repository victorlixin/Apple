       The file /etc/vfstab describes defaults for each file sys-
       tem.   The  information  is  in  the  following structure,
       defined  in  sys/vfstab.h:  struct  vfstab   {        char
       *vfs_special;         char      *vfs_fsckdev;         char
       *vfs_mountp;         char       *vfs_fstype;          char
       *vfs_fsckpass;         char      *vfs_automnt;        char
       *vfs_mntopts;      char   *vfs_macceiling; };

       The fields in the table are space-separated and  show  the
       block  special  or  resource name, the raw device to fsck,
       the default mount directory, the name of the  file  system
       type,  the  number used by fsck to decide whether to check
       the file system automatically,  whether  the  file  system
       should  be  mounted  automatically  by mountall, the mount
       options, and the default file system  level  ceiling.   If
       Enhanced  Security  is  not installed, the field that dis-
       plays the default file system level ceiling is  not  used.
       A ``-'' is used to indicate no entry in a field.

       The  family  of  routines  are  used  to read and write to
       /etc/vfstab.
