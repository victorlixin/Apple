       It  is  sometimes  convenient  to maintain text files with
       non-standard tabs (that is, tabs that are not set at every
       eighth column).  Such files must generally be converted to
       a standard format, frequently by replacing all  tabs  with
       the  appropriate number of spaces, before they can be pro-
       cessed by commands.  A format specification  occurring  in
       the first line of a text file specifies how tabs are to be
       expanded in the remainder of the file.

       A format specification consists of a sequence  of  parame-
       ters separated by blanks and surrounded by the brackets <:
       and :>.  Each parameter consists of a keyletter,  possibly
       followed immediately by a value.  The following parameters
       are recognized: The t parameter specifies the tab settings
       for  the  file.  The value of tabs must be one of the fol-
       lowing: a list of  column  numbers  separated  by  commas,
       indicating  tabs set at the specified columns a - followed
       immediately by an integer n, indicating tabs at  intervals
       of  n columns a - followed by the name of a ``canned'' tab
       specification

       Standard tabs  are  specified  by  t-8,  or  equivalently,
       t1,9,17,25,  and  so  on.  The canned tabs that are recog-
       nized are defined by the command.  The s parameter  speci-
       fies  a  maximum  line size.  The value of size must be an
       integer.  Size checking is performed after tabs have  been
       expanded,  but  before  the  margin  is  prepended.  The m
       parameter specifies a number of spaces to be prepended  to
       each line.  The value of margin must be an integer.  The d
       parameter takes no value.  Its presence indicates that the
       line  containing the format specification is to be deleted
       from the converted file.  The e parameter takes no  value.
       Its  presence indicates that the current format is to pre-
       vail only until another format  specification  is  encoun-
       tered in the file.

       Default  values, which are assumed for parameters not sup-
       plied, are t-8 and m0.  If the s parameter is  not  speci-
       fied, no size checking is performed.  If the first line of
       a file does not contain a format specification, the  above
       defaults  are  assumed for the entire file.  The following
       is an example of a line containing a format specification:
       * <:t5,10,15 s72:> *

       If  a  format specification can be disguised as a comment,
       it is not necessary to code the d parameter.
