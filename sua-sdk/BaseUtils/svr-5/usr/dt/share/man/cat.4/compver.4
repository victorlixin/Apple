       compver is an ASCII file used to specify previous versions
       of the associated package which are upward compatible.  It
       is created by a package developer.

       Each  line of the file specifies a previous version of the
       associated package with which the current version is back-
       ward compatible.

       Since some packages may require installation of a specific
       version of another software package, compatibility  infor-
       mation  is  extremely  crucial.   Consider, for example, a
       package called ``A'' which  requires  version  ``1.0''  of
       application  ``B'' as a prerequisite for installation.  If
       the customer installing ``A'' has a newer version of ``B''
       (1.3),  the  compver  file  for  ``B''  must indicate that
       ``1.3'' is compatible with version ``1.0''  in  order  for
       the customer to install package ``A.''

       The comparison of  the  version  string  disregards  white
       space  and tabs.  It is performed on a word-by-word basis.
       Thus Version    1.3 and Version 1.3  would  be  considered
       the same.
