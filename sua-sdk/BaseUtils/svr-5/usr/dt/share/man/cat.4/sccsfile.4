       An  SCCS  (Source  Code  Control  System) file is an ASCII
       file.  It consists of six logical parts: the checksum, the
       delta  table (contains information about each delta), user
       names (contains login names and/or numerical group IDs  of
       users  who may add deltas), flags (contains definitions of
       internal keywords), comments (contains arbitrary  descrip-
       tive  information  about the file), and the body (contains
       the actual text lines intermixed with control lines).

       Throughout an SCCS file there are lines which  begin  with
       the  ASCII  SOH  (start of heading) character (octal 001).
       This character is hereafter referred  to  as  the  control
       character  and  will be represented graphically as @.  Any
       line described below that is  not  depicted  as  beginning
       with  the  control  character  is prevented from beginning
       with the control character.

       Entries of the form DDDDD represent a five-digit string (a
       number between 00000 and 99999).

       Each  logical  part of an SCCS file is described in detail
       below.

       The checksum is the first line of an SCCS file.  The  form
       of the line is: @hDDDDD

       The  value  of  the checksum is the sum of all characters,
       except those of the first line.  The @h provides  a  magic
       number of (octal) 064001, depending on byte order.

       The  delta  table consists of a variable number of entries
       of one of the following  forms:  @s  DDDDD/DDDDD/DDDDD  @d
       <type>  <SID>   yr/mo/da hr:mi:se  <pgmr>  DDDDD  DDDDD @i
       DDDDD ...  @x DDDDD ...  @g DDDDD ...  @m <MR number>
         . . .  @c <comments> . . .
         . . .  @e

       The  first  line  (@s)  contains  the  number   of   lines
       inserted/deleted/unchanged, respectively.  The second line
       (@d) contains the type of the delta (normal: D or removed:
       R),  the  SCCS  ID of the delta, the date and time of cre-
       ation of the delta, the login name  corresponding  to  the
       real  user  ID  at the time the delta was created, and the
       serial numbers of the delta and its  predecessor,  respec-
       tively.

       The  @i,  @x,  and  @g lines contain the serial numbers of
       deltas  included,  excluded,  and  ignored,  respectively.
       These lines are optional.

       The   @m   lines  (optional)  each  contain  one  MRnumber

                                                                1

       associated with the delta; the @c lines  contain  comments
       associated  with  the  delta.   The @e line ends the delta
       table entry.

   UUsseerr nnaammeess
       The list of login names  and/or  numerical  group  IDs  of
       users  who  may  add deltas to the file, separated by new-
       lines.  The lines  containing  these  login  names  and/or
       numerical group IDs are surrounded by the bracketing lines
       @u and @U.  An empty list allows anyone to make  a  delta.
       Any line starting with a !  prohibits the succeeding group
       or user from making deltas.

   FFllaaggss
       Keywords used internally.  See  for  more  information  on
       their   use.    Each   flag   line   takes  the  form:  @f
       <flag> <optional text>

       The following flags are defined: <type of  program>  <pro-
       gram  name>  <keyword string> <module name> <floor> <ceil-
       ing>   <default-sid>   <lock-releases>   <user    defined>
       <reserved for use in interfaces>

       The t flag defines the replacement for the %Y% identifica-
       tion keyword.  The v flag controls prompting for  MR  num-
       bers in addition to comments; if the optional text is pre-
       sent it defines an MR number  validity  checking  program.
       The  i  flag controls the warning/error aspect of the ``No
       id keywords'' message.  When the i flag  is  not  present,
       this  message  is  only a warning; when the i flag is pre-
       sent, this message causes a fatal error (the file will not
       be ``gotten'', or the delta will not be made).  When the b
       flag is present the -b keyletter may be used  on  the  get
       command  to  cause a branch in the delta tree.  The m flag
       defines the first choice for the replacement text  of  the
       %M%  identification keyword.  The f flag defines the floor
       release; the release below which no deltas may  be  added.
       The  c flag defines the ceiling release; the release above
       which no deltas may be added.   The  d  flag  defines  the
       default  SID  to  be  used when none is specified on a get
       command.  The n flag causes delta to insert a  null  delta
       (a  delta  that applies no changes) in those releases that
       are skipped when a delta is made in  a  new  release  (for
       example,  when delta 5.1 is made after delta 2.7, releases
       3 and 4 are skipped).  The absence of the  n  flag  causes
       skipped  releases  to  be  completely  empty.   The j flag
       causes get to allow concurrent edits of the same base SID.
       The  l  flag  defines  a  list of releases that are locked
       against editing.  The q flag defines the  replacement  for
       the  %n%  identification  keyword.   The z flag is used in
       specialized interface programs.

   CCoommmmeennttss
       Arbitrary text is surrounded by the  bracketing  lines  @t

                                                                2

       and  @T.   The  comments  section typically will contain a
       description of the file's purpose.

   BBooddyy
       The body consists of text lines and control  lines.   Text
       lines  do  not  begin  with the control character, control
       lines do.  There are three kinds of control lines: insert,
       delete,  and  end,  represented  by:  @I DDDDD @D DDDDD @E
       DDDDD

       respectively.  The digit string is the serial number  cor-
       responding to the delta for the control line.
