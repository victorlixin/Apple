       The  file  /etc/profile  contains  shell commands that are
       executed at  login  time  for  any  user  whose  entry  in
       /etc/passwd has a shell specified in the shell field whose
       name ends in sh.

       The /etc/profile file allows the system  administrator  to
       perform services for the entire user community.

       The  default  /etc/profile  performs the following routine
       tasks (among others): set default file creation  mask  set
       locale environment variables set console terminal capabil-
       ities check email and news set environment  variables  for
       an  X/Open-compliant  execution environment;  see ``X/Open
       Execution Environment''

       It is also not unusual for /etc/profile to execute special
       actions for the root login or the su command.

       Computers  running  outside  the  U.S.  Eastern  time zone
       should have the line .  /etc/TIMEZONE  included  early  in
       /etc/profile [see

       If  a  login's entry in the /etc/passwd file has the shell
       /u95/bin/sh in the shell field, then  the  following  com-
       mands are executed from /etc/profile when the user logs in
       to the system: PATH=/u95/bin:$PATH POSIX2=on

       This sets the logged in user's  execution  environment  to
       conform  to  X/Open Interface Definitions, Version 4 Issue
       2.

       The PATH setting causes command searching  to  begin  with
       /u95/bin  so  that  any  commands found there are executed
       rather than other versions found in  standard  directories
       appearing later in the PATH string.  For example, entering
       sh on the command line with PATH  set  as  above  executes
       /u95/bin/sh  rather  than  /usr/bin/sh (/u95/bin/sh is the
       version of the Korn Shell that complies with X/Open Inter-
       face Definitions, Version 4 Issue 2; see

       The setting of the POSIX2 environment variable changes the
       behavior of many standard commands to match  the  behavior
       specified in X/Open Interface Definitions, Version 4 Issue
       2.

       Care  must  be  taken in providing system-wide services in
       /etc/profile.  Personal  .profile  files  are  better  for
       serving all but the most global needs.

       The  file  $HOME/.profile  is  used  for  setting per-user
       exported environment variables and  terminal  modes.   The
       following  example is typical (except for the comments): #
       Make some environment variables global  export  MAIL  PATH
       TERM # Set file creation mask umask 022 # Tell me when new
       mail comes in MAIL=/var/mail/$LOGNAME # Add my bin  direc-
       tory  to  the shell search sequence PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin #
       Set terminal type  TERM=${L0:-u/n/k/n/o/w/n}  while  :  do
            if  [ -f ${TERMINFO:-/usr/share/lib/terminfo}/?/$TERM
       ]       then  break       elif  [  -f  /usr/share/lib/ter-
       minfo/?/$TERM  ]       then  break      else echo "invalid
       term  $TERM"  1>&2       fi        echo   "terminal:   \c"
            read TERM done # Set the erase character to backspace
       stty erase '^H' echoe

                                                                2
