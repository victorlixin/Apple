       These  files,  conventionally called /dev/fd/0, /dev/fd/1,
       /dev/fd/2, and so on, refer to  files  accessible  through
       file descriptors.  If file descriptor n is open, these two
       system   calls   have    the    same    effect:    fd    =
       open("/dev/fd/n",mode); fd = dup(n);

       On  these  files  is  equivalent to open, and the read and
       write bits are ignored and O_TRUNC is failed with  ENOSYS.
       As  with dup, subsequent reads or writes on fd fail unless
       the original file descriptor allows the operations.

       For convenience in referring to standard  input,  standard
       output,  and standard error, an additional set of names is
       provided: /dev/stdin is a synonym for /dev/fd/0, /dev/std-
       out for /dev/fd/1, and /dev/stderr for /dev/fd/2.

       returns  -1 and EBADF if the associated file descriptor is
       not open.  However, if the truncation is specified in  the
       call  to open, then ENOSYS is returned.  If a file is open
       for reading, an attempt to  reopen  it  for  writing  will
       fail;  instead  a  new file descriptor (read-only) is cre-
       ated.

       always returns with success.  returns a  reasonable  value
       for  /dev/fd itself, but when called for files in /dev/fd,
       the attributes for those ``files'' are faked.   Note  also
       that  using  on /dev/fd always lists nf files, where nf is
       the user's current soft limit for open files, and not only
       those the user has opened.

                                                                1
