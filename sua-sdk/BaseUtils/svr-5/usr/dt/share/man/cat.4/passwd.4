       /etc/passwd  is an ASCII file that contains basic informa-
       tion about each user's account.

       For each authorized user, the passwd file contains a  one-
       line  entry, of the form:      login_name : password : uid
       : gid : comment : home_dir : login_shell

       where: is the name specified by the user when logging  in.
       This field contains no uppercase characters, should not be
       more than eight characters long, and should begin  with  a
       non-numeric  character (that is, any alphabetic or special
       character except colon).  contains the character x.   This
       field  remains  only  for compatibility reasons.  Password
       information is contained in the file /etc/shadow  [see  is
       the  user's  numerical  ID for the system, which should be
       unique.  is the numerical ID of the  group  to  which  the
       user  belongs.  is any information you think might be use-
       ful to a user of this file which is not included elsewhere
       in  the  file.   is the pathname of the directory in which
       the user is initially positioned upon logging in.  is  the
       user's initial shell program.  If this field is empty, the
       default shell is /usr/bin/sh.

       Fields are separated by a colon; entries, by  a  new-line.
       Comment  lines  (lines preceded by the # (hash) character)
       are not allowed in the /etc/passwd file.

       /etc/passwd has general read permission  on  all  systems,
       and can be used by routines that map numerical user IDs to
       names.

       The passwd file can also have lines  beginning  with  a  +
       (plus  sign)  which  means to incorporate entries from the
       Network Information Service (NIS).  There are three styles
       of  +  entries  in  the passwd file: by itself, + means to
       insert the entire contents of the  NIS  password  file  at
       that  point;  +name means to insert the entry (if any) for
       name from the NIS service at that point; +@ netgroup means
       to insert the entries for all members of the network group
       netgroup at that point.  If a + name entry has a  non-null
       password,  comment,  home-dir,  or  login-shell field, the
       value of that field overrides what is contained in the NIS
       service.  The uid and gid fields cannot be overridden.

       The  passwd  file  can  also have lines beginning with a -
       (minus sign) which means to disallow entries from the  NIS
       service.   There are two styles of - entries in the passwd
       file: - name means to disallow any subsequent entries  (if
       any)  for  name  (in  this file or in the NIS service); -@

                                                                1

passwd(4)                                               passwd(4)

       netgroup means to disallow any subsequent entries for  all
       members of the network group netgroup.

       When  the Network Information Service (NIS) is in use, the
       local /etc/passwd file is consulted first,  then  the  NIS
       maps passwd.byname or passwd.byuid on the NIS server.

       Here  is  a sample passwd file: root:x:0:10:God:/:/bin/csh
       fred:x:508:10:&   Fredericks:/usr2/fred:/bin/csh    +john:
       +@documentation:no-login: +::::Guest

       In this example, there are specific entries for users root
       and fred, to ensure that they can log  in  even  when  the
       system is running standalone.  The user john will have his
       password entry in the  NIS  service  incorporated  without
       change;  anyone  in  the  netgroup documentation will have
       their password field disabled, and  anyone  else  will  be
       able  to log in with their usual password, shell, and home
       directory, but with a comment field of Guest.

       To avoid inconsistencies with the I&A  security  database,
       NIS  entries  should  always come at the end of the passwd
       file.

       language-specific message file [See LANG on  Corresponding
       NIS map containing password information.  The user name is
       the key in the map.  Same as passwd.byname, except key  is
       user ID instead of user name.
