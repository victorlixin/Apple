       One  of  the  kernel  configuration files, a Sd file is an
       optional file that executes when the system is  shut  down
       to  perform  any  cleanup required for an installed kernel
       module.  Normally, this is a shell script (see

       When the Sd component of a module's Driver Software  Pack-
       age (DSP) is installed, stores the driver's Sd file infor-
       mation in /etc/conf/sd.d/module-name, where module-name is
       the  name  of the module being installed.  Package scripts
       should never access /etc/conf/sd.d  files  directly;  only
       the idinstall command should be used.

       The contents of the /etc/conf/sd.d directory are linked to
       /etc/idsd.d whenever a new configuration of the kernel  is
       first booted.  On the next system shutdown--and all subse-

       upon entering init level 0, 5, or 6 (see
