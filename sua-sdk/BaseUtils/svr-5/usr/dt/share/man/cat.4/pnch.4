       The  PNCH  format is a convenient representation for files
       consisting of card images in an arbitrary code.

       A PNCH file is a simple concatenation of card records.   A
       card  record consists of a single control byte followed by
       a variable number of data bytes.  The control byte  speci-
       fies the number (which must lie in the range 0-80) of data
       bytes that follow.  The data bytes are  8-bit  codes  that
       constitute  the  card  image.   If there are fewer than 80
       data bytes, it is understood that  the  remainder  of  the
       card image consists of trailing blanks.
