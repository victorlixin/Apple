       This  set information file defines disk space requirements
       for the target environment.  It contains information about
       all  of  the packages in the set.  This file describes the
       disk space taken up by installed files as  well  as  extra
       space  needed  for dynamically created files, as described
       in each package's file.

       The generic format of a line in  this  file  is:  pathname
       blocks  inodes

       Definitions  for  each field are as follows: The short, or
       abbreviated, name of a package  in  the  set.   This  name
       describes  which package of the set requires the amount of
       space described by the rest of the data on  this  line  in
       the  setsize  file.   Names a directory in which there are
       objects that will be installed or that will require  addi-
       tional  space.   The  name  may  be  the  mountpoint for a
       filesystem.  Names that do not  begin  with  a  slash  (/)
       indicate  relocatable  directories.  Defines the number of
       512 byte disk blocks  required  for  installation  of  the
       files  and  directory  entries  contained in the pathname.
       (Do not include filesystem-dependent disk usage).  Defines
       the  number of inodes required for the installation of the
       files and directory entries contained in the pathname.

       At installation time, the  set  installation  calls  which
       reduces  the  setsize  file for a set to a file containing
       entries for only the packages that are  selected.   It  is
       this resulting
