       /etc/dfs/dfstab  contains  commands  for sharing resources
       across a network. dfstab gives a network  administrator  a
       uniform  method  of  controlling  the automatic sharing of
       local resources.

       Each line of the dfstab file consists of  a  command.  The
       dfstab file can be read by the shell directly to share all
       resources, or network administrators can prepare their own
       shell scripts to execute particular lines from dfstab.

       The contents of dfstab are executed automatically when the
       system enters run level 3.
