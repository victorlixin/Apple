       One  of  the  kernel configuration files, an Rc file is an
       optional file that executes when the system is  booted  to
       initialize an installed kernel module.  (Normally, this is
       a shell script (see

       When the Rc component of a module's Driver Software  Pack-
       age  (DSP)  is  installed,  stores the module's Rc file in
       /etc/conf/rc.d/module-name, where module-name is the  name
       of  the  module  being  installed.  Package scripts should
       never access /etc/conf/rc.d files directly; the  idinstall
       command should be used instead.

       The contents of the /etc/conf/rc.d directory are linked to
       /etc/idrc.d whenever a new configuration of the kernel  is
       first  booted.   On this initial reboot, and on all subse-
       quent reboots, the module's Rc file is invoked upon enter-
       ing init level 2 (see
