       The  unistd.h  header  file defines the symbolic constants
       and structures not already defined  or  declared  in  some
       other  header  file.   The contents of this file are shown
       below.

       The following  symbolic  constants  are  defined  for  the
       access function (see

       Test  for  read  permission.   Test  for write permission.
       Test for execute (search) permission.  Test for  existence
       of file.  Use effective ids instead of real ids.

       The  constants  F_OK,  R_OK, W_OK and X_OK and the expres-
       sions R_OK|W_OK, R_OK|X_OK  and  R_OK|W_OK|X_OK  all  have
       distinct  values.   EFF_ONLY_OK  can  be  ORed with any of
       these.

       unistd declares the constant null pointer

       The following symbolic constants are defined for the func-
       tion:

       Unlock  a  previously  locked  region.   Lock a region for
       exclusive use.  Test and lock a region for exclusive  use.
       Test a region for other processes locks.

       The  following  symbolic constants are defined for the and
       functions (they have distinct values):

       Set file offset to offset.  Set  file  offset  to  current
       plus offset.  Set file offset to EOF plus offset.

       The  following  symbolic constants are defined (with fixed
       values):

       Integer value indicating version of  the  POSIX  standard.
       Integer  value indicating version of the XPG to which sys-
       tem is compliant.

       The following symbolic constant is defined for the confstr
       function:

       Indicates  whether  to  use  the  default PATH environment
       variable that finds all the standard utilities.

       The following symbolic constants are defined  to  indicate
       that the option is present:

       Implementation  supports  job control.  The functions save
       the effective user and group.  Terminal special characters

                                                                1

       acter.

       The following symbolic constants are defined  for  version
       test  macros:  Defined  to be 1 if the implementation sup-
       ports the fseeko(3S) and ftello(3S) functions.  Defined to
       be  1  if  the implementation supports the aio_read(3aio),
       aio_write(3aio), and lio_listio(3S) functions.  Defined to
       be 1 if the implementation supports the transitional func-
       tions  creat64(2),   fstat64(2),   fstatvfs64(2),   ftrun-
       cate64(3C),    ftw64(3C),   getrlimit64(2),   lockf64(3C),

       readdir64(3C),  stat64(2),  setrlimit64(2),  statvfs64(2),
       truncate64(3C), Defined to be 1 if the implementation sup-
       ports   the   transitional  functions  aio_cancel64(3aio),

       aio_write64(3aio), and lio_listio64(3S).  Defined to be  1
       if  the implementation supports the transitional functions
       fgetpos64(3C),    freopen64(3S),    fsetpos64(3C),    tmp-
       file64(3S), fopen64(3S), fseeko64(3S), and ftello64(3S),
