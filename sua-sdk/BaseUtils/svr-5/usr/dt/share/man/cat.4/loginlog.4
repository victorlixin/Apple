       After  LOGFAILURES unsuccessful login attempts, where LOG-
       FAILURES is 5 if not defined  in  /etc/default/login,  all
       the  attempts  are  logged  in the file /var/adm/loginlog.
       This file contains one record  for  each  failed  attempt.
       Each  record  contains  the login name, tty specification,
       and time.

       This is an ASCII file.  Each entry is separated  from  the
       next by a new-line.  Within each entry, each field is sep-
       arated from the next by a colon.

       By default, loginlog does not  exist,  so  no  logging  is
       done.   To  enable  logging,  the log file must be created
       with read and write permission for owner only.  The  owner
       must be root; the group, sys.
