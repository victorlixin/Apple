       Options  for the console terminal terminfo type can be set
       or changed with keywords in /etc/default/coterm.  The fol-
       lowing  keywords are recognized.  This keyword defines the
       default terminal type for the console terminal.   Applica-
       tions  using  the console terminal in text mode should use
       the value of this keyword in the  TERM  environment  vari-
       able.   If  set  to  the value yes, this keyword indicates
       that the system default locale is one that  needs  support
       for  multibyte characters.  In this case, the command will
       initiate multibyte console mode when it is called, and the
       system will initiate multibyte console mode on reboot.

       If  unset  or  set to any value other than yes, the system
       default locale is one  that  does  not  need  support  for
       multibyte characters.
