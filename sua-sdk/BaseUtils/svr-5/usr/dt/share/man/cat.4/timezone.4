       This file sets and exports the time zone environment vari-
       able TZ.

       This file is executed by to set  the  default  local  time
       zone  on  system startup.  The TZ variable can also be set
       by a user process to override the default time zone.

       The rules for interpreting the contents of the TZ variable
       are given on

       Some applications may expect a TZ string  other  than  the
       default,  and  so  may  exhibit  unexpected  behavior when
       reporting the time.  Setting the TZ variable  before  exe-
       cuting  the  program  to the value expected by the program
       can sometimes correct any such problems.  From the  shell,
       this  can be done for a single execution of a shell script
       or binary as in the following example  (using  the  United
       States  east  coast  time  zone as an example): TZ=EST5EDT
