       The  Data  Center  Feature  Supplement  adds the following
       parameters to the list of parameters that can be displayed
       and changed using the Boot Command Processor (BCP) command
       described on .CM boot 1M .

       LI "CACHE_LINE=number" Set this parameter to  specify  the
       size  of the L1 cache line (in bytes) of whichever proces-
       sor cache has the greatest cache line size.   Its  purpose
       is  to  segregate the bin locks into separate cache lines.
       The default, 128, is taken from cache information provided
       by  the  processor itself.  It may improve advantageous to
       adjust this value if an external cache  of  greater  cache
       line  size  is used, or if a new processor, unknown to the
       kernel, is used.  Set this paramter to specify the  number
       of separate bins from which free pages are allocated.  Its
       purpose is to optimize allocation of pages.   The  minimum
       value  is  32, the default is 128, and is taken from cache
       information provided by the processor itself.  It  may  be
       advantageous  to raise the value if a large external cache
       is used, or if a new processor, unknown to the kernel,  is
       used.   The  proper  formula for computing this should be:
       MAX [cachesize/PAGESIZE/associativity]  (over all caches)

       In  addition,  the  default   value   of   the   parameter
       GEN_MEM_MAX=memsize has changed to 32768 (32GB).
