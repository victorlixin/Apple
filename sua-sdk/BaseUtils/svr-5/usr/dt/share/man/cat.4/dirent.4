       Different  file  system types may have different directory
       entries.  The dirent structure defines a file system inde-
       pendent directory entry, which contains information common
       to directory entries in different file  system  types.   A
       set  of  these  structures is returned by the system call.
       (Also see for descriptions of other routines that use  the
       dirent structure.)

       The dirent structure is defined below.  struct  dirent {
               ino_t            d_ino;
               off_t            d_off;
               unsigned short   d_reclen;
               char             d_name[1]; };

       The d_ino is a number which is unique for each file in the
       file system.  The field d_off is the offset of the  subse-
       quent directory entry in the actual file system directory.
       The field d_name is the beginning of the  character  array
       giving the name of the directory entry.  This name is null
       terminated and may  have  at  most  MAXNAMLEN  characters.
       This  results in file system independent directory entries
       being variable length entities.  The value of d_reclen  is
       the  record  length of this entry.  This length is defined
       to be the number of bytes between the  current  entry  and
       the  next one, so that the next structure will be suitably
       aligned.

       The dirent64 structure defines a file  system  independent
       directory  entry,  which  contains  information  common to
       directory entries in different file system types and  sup-
       ports  large  files.   dirent64  is otherwise identical to
       dirent.

       The dirent64 structure is defined below: struct  dirent {
               ino64_t          d_ino;
               off_t            d_off;
               unsigned short   d_reclen;
               char             d_name[1]; };
