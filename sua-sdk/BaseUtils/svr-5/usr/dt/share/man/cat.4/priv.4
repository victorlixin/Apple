       A  privilege  data  file  entry  has the following format:
       size:cksum:time:privlist:pathname

       Each field in the entry is separated by a colon (:)  char-
       acter.  The size field contains the file size in bytes, as
       returned by stat(2).  The cksum field contains a  checksum
       (see  sum(1)) value for the file.  The time field contains
       the time the file status was last  changed,  expressed  in
       seconds  since the epoch (January 1, 1970), as returned in
       the st_ctime field by stat(2).   These  three  fields  are
       used  to  check  that the file has not been changed in any
       manner since the time the file was  given  privilege.   If
       this  happens, the privileges no longer apply, and must be
       reset using the filepriv(1) command.

       The pathname field contains the absolute pathname  to  the
       file given the privileges in the entry.

       The  privlist  field  contains a list of the privileges on
       the file.  The list is grouped according to privilege  set
       (i.e.,  fixed or inheritable). The fixed privilege set for
       the file is listed first.   Each  set  is  listed  with  a
       prepended  % character, followed by a six letter set iden-
       tification string, fixed for the fixed set, and inher  for
       the  inheritable  set,  and then a comma separated list of
       privilege names. The intro(2) page contains a list of  all
       privilege names.

       The privilege data file is /etc/security/tcb/privs.

       Assume an executable file named /usr/bin/example was given
       a fixed core privilege and inheritable owner  and  auditwr
       privileges.  The  file  has  a  size of 5000 bytes and the
       checksum  value  is  341.  The  entry  for  this  file  in
       /etc/security/tcb/privs       might       look       like:
       5000:341:709323090:%fixed,core%inher,owner,auditwr:/usr/bin/exam-
