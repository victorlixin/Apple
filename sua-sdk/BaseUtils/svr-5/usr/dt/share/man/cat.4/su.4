       Options for the su command [see can be set or changed with
       keywords in /etc/default/su.  The following  keywords  are
       recognized  by su: Log (in filename) successful and unsuc-
       cessful attempts to execute su.  If a user executes su  to
       become  a privileged user on a device other than device, a
       printed message will appear on device to inform the admin-
       istrator  of that fact.  When a user executes su to become
       an unprivileged user, the  user's  path  will  be  set  to
       path_list.   The default is /usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin.  When a
       user executes su to become a privileged user,  the  user's
       path   will   be   set   to  path_list.   The  default  is
       /sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/ccs/bin.     If    this
       parameter exists and is set to No, the su command does not
       prompt  for  a  password  (even  if  one  is  defined  for
       login_name).   The invoking user, however, must still have
       appropriate privilege to execute su successfully.  If this
       parameter does not exist, or is set to anything other than
       No (including  NULL),  su  prompts  for  a  password  when
       invoked  and validates the password (if one is defined for
       login_name).   If  the  Enhanced  Security  Utilities  are
       installed,  PROMPT  is  set  to  No by default; otherwise,
       PROMPT is not set.
