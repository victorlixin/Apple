       The  /etc/default/workstations  file  contains information
       about the number of virtual terminals (VTs)  that  can  be
       open on the system.

       The  content  of the file is a line of the following form:
       /dev/vt dev/kd/kd  num

       By default num is set to the maximum of 15.   This  speci-
       fies that VTs /dev/vt00 through dev/vt14 are available for
       use.  Valid values for num are in the range 1-15.

       System resources are not actually consumed until a  VT  is
       opened,  and the resources are released when it is closed.
       To save system resources you can reduce the number of  VTs
       available.   Do this by editing this file and changing num
       to the number of VTs desired.  The system must be rebooted
       before the new value of num takes effect.
