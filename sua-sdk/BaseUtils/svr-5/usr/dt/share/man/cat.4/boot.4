DDeessccrriippttiioonn
       Parameters  for  the boot program can be set or changed in
       /stand/boot.  Their current values can  be  displayed  and
       changed  using  the  Boot  Command Processor (BCP) command
       described on When you use the BCP during the Initial  Sys-
       tem  Load  (ISL), the changes you make to these parameters
       are permanent.  When you use the BCP during  reboots,  the
       changes you make apply to that boot session only.

       In  the parameters listed below, device can be prefixed to
       any filename to override  the  default  device.   Standard
       values  for  device,  except in the CONSOLE parameter take
       the following forms: specifies the floppy disk, drive num-
       ber  unit  specifies  the  hard  disk,  drive  number unit
       (starting at zero), partition number partition, and  slice
       number slice.  partition can also be specified as an oper-
       ating  system  type  name  (UNIX,  DOS,  (DOS_12,  DOS_16,
       DOS_32,  or  DOS_EXT),  NT,  or OS2).  If partition is not
       defined, it defaults to UNIX.  slice specifies  the  slice
       number  for  the root filesystem, allowing the possibility
       of backup roots.

       All parameters, whether recognized by  boot  or  not,  are
       passed to the kernel.

       The  following  parameters  are recognized by boot and are
       also passed to the kernel for further processing.   Define
       this  parameter  to indicate the alignment requirement, in
       bytes, for FILES  images.   Normally,  this  parameter  is
       specified  by  the  kernel: it should not be changed manu-
       ally.  Define this parameter to indicate whether  boot  is
       to  load  the kernel, then either start booting it immedi-
       ately (or after a defined amount of time),  or  enter  the
       BCP  (an  interactive  boot  session).  YES means the boot
       will begin immediately upon  completion  of  loading.   NO
       means  enter  the BCP immediately upon completion of load-
       ing.  num specifies the minimum time (in seconds) to  wait
       after  the  start  of  loading BOOTPROG to begin the boot.
       AUTOBOOT is set to 5 by default.  Define this parameter to
       indicate  the Bootstrap Loadable Modules to be loaded into
       boot.  BLM files are loaded from STARTDEV, unless filename
       specifies  a  device.   Setting  this parameter causes the
       specified BLM(s) to be immediately  loaded.   Define  this
       parameter  to  name  the  device  BOOTPROG is loaded from.
       Define this parameter to change the  name  of  the  kernel
       file  to boot.  As delivered, the default is unix.  During
       a user-initiated interactive session, the current value of
       BOOTPROG is the default file used when boot times out.

       For  example,  BOOTPROG=myunix directs the boot program to
       load the /stand/myunix file.  The kernel  file  is  loaded
       from  BOOTDEV  unless filename specifies a device.  Define
       this parameter to override the  kernel's  default  console

                                                                1

boot(4)                                                   boot(4)

       device (used by the boot program for kernel messages, ker-
       nel debugger  I/O,  /dev/sysmsg,  and  the  console  login
       prompt).   CONSOLE  defaults to the console-capable device
       configured with the highest order  number  (see  Typically
       this is kd.

       If  CONSOLE is defined, device specifies the device to use
       and minor specifies the minor number for that device.

       If device is a console-capable device configured into  the
       kernel,  the  kernel  will use it for its default console.
       If device is one of the following, boot will  use  it  for
       its  console:  the  standard PC console (at minor 0) minor
       can be 0 through 15.

       iasy supports the serial port device.   The  minor  number
       indicates  the same device variant as it would under unix,
       however, because it is interpreted by boot, there  may  be
       other  restrictions  on its value.  Hence, the only allow-
       able values for the iasy device minor are  0  through  15,
       which specify various degrees of flow and modem control on
       COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4 serial ports.  at minor 0.

       mirrorcon is the  special  console  pseudo-device  driver,
       useful  for  remote  administration  and debugging.  It is
       found in the Advanced  Commands  package.   The  parameter
       string  for mirrorcon is a list of console device specifi-
       cations, each in the form described above and separated by
       plus signs: device(minor[,params])

       All  console  output will be sent to each of the specified
       devices, and any input entered on any of the devices  will
       be  used as console input.  The minor number for mirrorcon
       must always be zero.

       The effect of mirrorcon does not  extend  to  the  console
       login prompt or use of /dev/console in general.  /dev/con-
       sole can only be a single  device.   Whichever  device  is
       first  in  the parameter string for mirrorcon will be used
       for /dev/console.

       The optional parameter string, params, is  passed  to  the
       console  device driver.  Its interpretation is driver-spe-
       cific.  The parameter string  params  is  device-specific.
       The  device  kd does not accept params.  For iasy and mir-
       rorcon, params is used to specify baud  rate,  data  bits,
       and  parity,  in the following syntax: Bbaud|Cdata|Pparity
       baud  can  be  115200,  57600,  38400,  19200,  9600  (the
       default), 4800, 2400, 1200, 600, 300, or 110.

       data  can be any combination of 7, 8, or T.  7 and 8 spec-
       ify the number of data bits (8 is the default).  T  speci-
       fies 2 stop bits (1 is the default).

                                                                2

boot(4)                                                   boot(4)

       parity  defaults  to none, and can be set to O (odd), or E
       (even).

       Note that successful use of higher baud rates (above 9600)
       depends  on the UART hardware in the machine and cannot be
       guaranteed: characters may be lost if flow control is  not
       adhered to by the remote input device (terminal or modem).

       For example, the following definition sets the console  to
       iasy minor 0, the COM1 port using modem control (tests the
       state of the DCD line) and software flow control, the baud
       rate  to  1200,  the data bits to 7 (with 1 stop bit), and
       the parity to odd: CONSOLE=iasy(0,B1200|C7|PO)

       The following definition sets the console to  COM2,  using
       no  flow  control, at 38400 baud, with no parity checking,
       and 1 stop bit: CONSOLE=iasy(5,B38400)

       The following definition sets the console to the  PC  con-
       sole keyboard (the default): CONSOLE=kd(0)

       The  following  definition  uses mirrorcon for two devices
       named kd and  iasy,  redirecting  the  data  to  and  from
       /dev/console  to  the  PC console and keyboard, and to the
       serial port at minor 2.  That is, COM1 with no  flow  con-
       trol and no modem control (/dev/tty00t), at a baud rate of
       19200, with 8 data bits, 2 stop  bits,  and  even  parity:
       console=mirrorcon(0,kd(0)+iasy(2,  B19200|C8T|PE)) Enables
       32-bit  PCI  BIOS  call  support.   Disabled  by  default.
       Instructs  the  operating  system  to enable the processor
       serial number (PSN) feature, present on Pentium  III  sys-
       tems.  If enabled, the PSN can be read by applications via
       calls to the cpuid instruction.  By  default,  &geminiREL;
       disables  the PSN.  Define this parameter to name the aux-
       iliary files to be loaded when BOOTPROG  is  loaded.   The
       memory  used  to  load each file will appear in the MEMORY
       parameter as a single range with use set to name.  If name
       is omitted here, use will be set to filename in the MEMORY
       parameter.

       Auxiliary files are loaded from  BOOTDEV  unless  filename
       specifies  a  device.   Define  this  parameter  to enable
       debugging output for the ISL scripts.  If num is 1,  debug
       output  is  enabled.  All other values are ignored and are
       equivalent to  not  setting  the  parameter  at  all  (the
       default).  Log files are in /tmp/log during the process of
       installing the system.  They are in /isl after the  system
       has  rebooted.  Note that this parameter is effective only
       during ISL, not after the  installation  process  is  com-
       plete.   Define  this  parameter  to name a file to use as
       input to /sbin/init  (default  is  /etc/inittab).   Define
       this  parameter to override memory.  range is specified in
       the form low_address-high_address.  Addresses are in deci-
       mal,  and can be specified in bytes, or suffixed with K to

                                                                3

boot(4)                                                   boot(4)

       indicate kilobytes (1024 bytes), M to indicate  megabytes,
       or  G to indicate gigabytes.  Addresses can not exceed 4G.

       A range that is prefixed with +  is  added  to  the  known
       ranges so far; a range that begins with a - is subtracted.
       Ranges are applied in left-to-right order.  If  the  first
       range  has  neither a + nor a -, all known ranges are dis-
       carded and replaced by the specified range.   In  general,
       memory  that is already in use is never discarded.  Define
       this parameter to load  another  boot  parameter  file  in
       addition  to  /stand/boot.   Setting this parameter causes
       the specified filename to  be  immediately  loaded.   Boot
       parameter  files  are loaded from STARTDEV unless filename
       specifies a device.  If boot is waiting for input from the
       user and TIMEOUT is set, it waits for number seconds, then
       boots the kernel file defined by BOOTPROG.  The default is
       0,  which means to wait forever.  Once any key is pressed,
       boot will wait forever for additional input.

       These parameters are used to pass information to the  ker-
       nel,  such as details of the hardware configuration.  They

       The  following  parameters  are  processed  by  the kernel
       rather than by boot.  Set this parameter  to  specify  the
       size  of the L1 cache line (in bytes) of whichever proces-
       sor cache has the greatest cache line size.   Its  purpose
       is  to  segregate the bin locks into separate cache lines.
       The default, 128, is taken from cache information provided
       by  the  processor itself.  It may improve advantageous to
       adjust this value if an external cache  of  greater  cache
       line  size  is used, or if a new processor, unknown to the
       kernel, is used.  Set this parameter to YES to disable use
       of  internal  and external memory caches on i486 and above
       CPUs.  Set this parameter to YES to disable use of the PGE
       (Page Global Enable) optimization.  Otherwise, PGE will be
       used on all CPUs that  support  it.   You  must  set  this
       parameter  to  YES to enable detection of memory above 4GB
       (either using the BIOS call E820 or, alternatively,  using

                                                                4

boot(4)                                                   boot(4)

       whatever mechanism a custom PSM chooses to use).  Set this
       parameter to specify a maximum value,  in  megabytes,  for
       general  purpose  memory.  The default is 8192 (8GB).  Any
       memory above this value can be used as dedicated memory by
       setting  the DEDICATED_MEMORY parameter.  Set this parame-
       ter to YES to ignore hardware  machine  check  conditions.
       On  some  systems,  external  circuitry  delivers spurious
       machine check  conditions  to  the  CPU.   This  parameter
       allows  such machine checks to be ignored rather than dis-
       abling the system.  Define this parameter to  specify  the
       system  state  to  enter after booting.  This parameter is
       passed to /sbin/init and overrides the system state speci-
       fied  on  the  initdefault  line in the /etc/inittab file.
       The value of sysstate can be 0-6, s, or S.

       This parameter is particularly useful if a problem  causes
       your  system  to  fail before it reaches networking state.
       For example, if you have selected the wrong video  driver,
       the  graphical  login  will not start.  If you interrupt a
       reboot, and define INITSTATE to be s, you can boot to sin-
       gle-user  state,  and  correct  the  problem.  Define this
       parameter to specify devices that should not  be  accessed
       beyond  LUN 0.  The argument c specifies the controller, b
       specifies the bus, t the target, and  l  the  LUN  of  the
       device  causing  problems.   The parentheses are required,
       but any of the arguments can be omitted.  If omitted,  all
       valid values for that argument are matched.

       The  following  example shows that on controller 0, bus 0,
       the device at target 3 should be accessed only at  LUN  0,
       and all devices on controller 1 should be accessed only at
       LUN 0.  LUNSEARCH=(0:0,3),(1)

       The following example limits device searching to LUN 0 for
       all devices: LUNSEARCH=() Set this paramter to specify the
       number of separate bins from which free  pages  are  allo-
       cated.   Its  purpose  is to optimize allocation of pages.
       The minimum value is 32, the default is 128, and is  taken
       from  cache  information provided by the processor itself.
       It may be advantageous to  raise  the  value  if  a  large
       external  cache is used, or if a new processor, unknown to
       the kernel, is used.  The  proper  formula  for  computing
       this  should  be:  MAX  [cachesize/PAGESIZE/associativity]
       (over all caches) Set this parameter to YES to enable SCSI
       command  timeouts  that trigger SCSI device and bus recov-
       ery.  Otherwise, SCSI commands will not time out and  SCSI
       device  and  bus  hangs  can  only  be cleared by a system
       reboot.  Setting this parameter to NO is  useful  when  an
       unreasonable  timeout  value  has been set for a SCSI com-
       mand.  The system can boot without using the timeout  val-
       ues,  and  then the unreasonable timeout value can be cor-
       rected using the command.  Define this parameter to  force
       all  PSMs except name to be ignored.  Under normal circum-
       stances, the kernel tries each  PSM  until  one  succeeds.

                                                                5

boot(4)                                                   boot(4)

       The  fallback PSM is atup.  Specifies an alternative file-
       name for /stand/resmgr.  This parameter should be used  in
       conjunction  with  FILES  to  load an alternative resource
       manager database.   For  example,  FILES=resmgr:resmgr.sav
       RESMGR=resmgr.save  This  parameter  overrides the default
       root filesystem type built into the kernel from the ROOTF-
       STYPE  tunable  parameter.   The  root  filesystem will be
       assumed to be of type fstype instead  (ufs  or  vxfs,  for
       example).   If  fstype is blank, all configured filesystem
       types will be tried until one  succeeds  in  mounting  the
       root filesystem (the default).

       The  following  parameters  permit you to override default
       messages that are stored  in  /stand/bootmsgs.   Of  these
       parameters,   only   BOOTMSG1,   BOOTMSG2,  BOOTMSG3,  and
       BOOTMSG4 are recognized by boot, but all are passed to the
       kernel.   Define  this  parameter  to  change  the message
       issued when an automatic reboot is about  to  occur.   The
       default  message  that  this  parameter,  if defined, will
       override  is  "Automatic  Boot  Procedure."   Define  this
       parameter  to  change  the default boot message to string.
       The default message that this parameter, if defined,  will
       override  is  "Starting  UnixWare...."   This parameter is
       recognized by boot.  Define this parameter to  change  the
       default  boot string, used to indicate the beginning of an
       interactive boot session.  The standard setting  for  this
       message,  as defined in /stand/bootmsgs is: Bootstrap Com-
       mand Processor Ready for boot commands . . . [? for  help]
       This parameter is recognized by boot.  Define this parame-
       ter to change the default string displayed at  the  begin-
       ning  of  the command line.  The default string is [boot].
       This parameter is recognized by boot.  Define this parame-
       ter  to  change  the default string displayed when boot is
       waiting to display more.  The default  string  is  [MORE].
       This parameter is recognized by boot.  Define this parame-
       ter to change the default  copyright  line(s)  to  string.
       This  parameter can be defined multiple times, to accommo-
       date copyright notices that are more than one  line  long.
       The  default  setting  for  this  string,  as  defined  in
       /stand/bootmsgs is: Copyright 1997 SCO, Inc.   All  Rights
       Reserved.\  U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,642\ Define this parameter
       to list the devices attached to the SCSI bus.  string is a
       comma-separated list of SCSI device names.  It defaults to
       the        following:        HBA,DISK,TAPE,PRINTER,PROCES-
       SOR,WORM,CDROM,SCANNER,\ OPTICAL,CHANGER,COMMUNICATION

       The  order  of  devices  in  this list must be maintained.
       Only the first 13 characters of any device name are  used.
       Define  this parameter to change the message issued when a
       user requests a reboot.  If defined, this  parameter  will
       override   the   default   message,   "Press  any  key  to
       reboot...."  Define this parameter to change the last mes-
       sage  issued  before  user  processes  are  started.   The

       default message that  this  parameter,  if  defined,  will
       override is The system is coming up. Please wait..  Define
       this parameter to  change  the  default  product  name  to
       string.   The  string  can  contain  % tokens that will be
       replaced by information available from the system call  as
       shown   in  the  following  list:  SI_ARCHITECTURE  string
       SI_INITTAB_NAME  string  SI_MACHINE  string   (uname   -m)
       SI_HOSTNAME string (uname -n) SI_RELEASE string (uname -r)
       SI_SYSNAME string (uname -s) SI_VERSION string (uname  -v)
       a percent sign

       For example, the following string might be used:
        System V Release %r Version %v for the %a Family

       This  parameter can be defined multiple times, to accommo-
       date product names that are more than one line long.   The
