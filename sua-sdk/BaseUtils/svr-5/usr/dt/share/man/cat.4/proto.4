       When  a  job is submitted to at or batch, (see at (1)) the
       job is constructed as a shell script.   As  part  of  this
       process,  at  reads  a  prototype file, and uses it in the
       shell  script.   The  default  .proto  file   is:   #ident
       "@(#)adm:.proto 1.2" cd $d ulimit $l umask $m $<

       Text from the prototype file is copied to the shell script
       file, except for special variables that  are  replaced  by
       other  text:  is  replaced  by  the  current  directory is
       replaced by the current file size limit (see  ulimit  (2))
       is  replaced  by  the  current  umask  (see  umask (2)) is
       replaced by the time at  which  the  job  should  be  run.
       (Time is expressed as seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00
       Greenwich Mean Time and  is  preceded  by  a  colon.)   is
       replaced  by text read by at from the standard input (that
       is, the commands provided to at to be run in the job)

       When this default .proto file is used, the current  direc-
       tory  is  changed  to the current directory at the time at
       was run, the ulimit is changed to the ulimit at  the  time
       at  was  run, and the umask is changed to the umask at the
       time at was run.

       If the job is submitted in queue queue, at uses  the  file
       /etc/cron.d/.proto.queue  as  the  prototype  file  if  it
       exists, otherwise it will use the file /etc/cron.d/.proto.
