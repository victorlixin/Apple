       The  queuedefs  file  defines  the  characteristics of the
       queues managed by cron (1M).   Each  non-comment  line  in
       this  file  describes  one queue.  The format of each line
       is: queue.[njobj][nicen][nwaitw]

       The fields in this line are: The name of the queue.  a  is
       the  default  queue  for  jobs started by at (1); b is the
       default queue for jobs started by batch (see batch (1)); c
       is the default queue for jobs run from a crontab (1) file.
       The maximum number of jobs that can be run  simultaneously
       in  queue.   If more than njob jobs are ready to run, only
       the first njob jobs will be run, and the  others  will  be
       run  as  jobs  that  are currently running terminate.  The
       default value is 100.  The nice (1) value for all jobs  in
       queue  that  are  not  run  with a user ID of a privileged
       user.  The default value is 2.  The number of  seconds  to
       wait  before  rescheduling a job that was deferred because
       more than njob jobs were running in that job's  queue,  or
       because  more than 25 jobs were running in all the queues.
       The default value is 60.

       Lines beginning with # are comments, and are ignored.

       The  queuedefs  file  supplied  with  System  V is: a.4j1n
       b.2j2n90w

       The first line specifies how jobs are to be handled: Start
       a  maximum  of 4 concurrent jobs per user.  Use a value of
       1.  Do not retry jobs that cannot start because fails.

       The second line specifies how  jobs  are  to  be  handled:
       Start  a  maximum  of  2  concurrent jobs per user.  Use a
       value of 2.  Wait 90 seconds, then try again to start jobs
       that cannot start because fails.

                                                                1
