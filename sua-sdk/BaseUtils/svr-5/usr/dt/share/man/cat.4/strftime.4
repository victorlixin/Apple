       There  can  exist one printable file per locale to specify
       its date and time  formatting  information.   These  files
       must       be       kept       in       the      directory
       /usr/lib/locale/locale/LC_TIME.   The  contents  of  these
       files  are:  optional  abbreviated  month names (in order)
       optional month names (in order) optional abbreviated week-
       day  names  (in  order)  optional weekday names (in order)
       optional default strings that specify formats  for  locale
       time (%X) and locale date (%x) optional default format for
       cftime, if the argument for cftime is a null optional ante
       meridian  string  optional  post  meridian string optional
       default format for date command  output  optional  default
       format  for  local  time  for  12  hour clock (AM/PM form)
       optional separator optional alternate digit and era infor-
       mation for the locale

       For  1-11  above, each string is on a line by itself.  All
       white space is significant.  The order of the  strings  in
       the above list is the same order in which they must appear
       in the file.  If item 12 is present and any  of  1-10  are
       not  specified, item 11 must be present.  The separator is
       a lone % character.

       Alternate digit and era information may  be  omitted.   If
       present, the amount of information is variable, and fields
       are delimited by use of the following keywords.  They  can
       be  specified  in any order.  semicolon separated strings,
       each surrounded by double-quotes.  The first string is the
       alternate symbol for zero, the second is the alternate for
       one, and so on up to a maximum  of  100.   Less  than  100
       alternate  digit  symbols  may be specified.  Lines may be
       continued using the backlash (\) character.  definition of
       the  date format in the alternate era notation.  This is a
       single string surrounded by double-quotes.  definition  of

       semicolon  separated  strings,  each surrounded by double-
       quotes.  Within each string is an era description  segment
       which    has    the    following   format:        dir:off-
       set:start_date:end_date:era_name:era_format a + or - char-
       acter.  + denotes that years closer to the start_date have
       lower numbers  than  those  closer  to  the  end_date.   -
       denotes  that  years  closer to the start_date have higher
       numbers than those closer to the end_date.  the year  num-
       ber  closest  to  the start_date in the era.  the date for
       the start of the era, in the form yyyy/mm/dd,  where  yyyy
       is  the  year,  mm is the month, and dd is the day.  Years
       prior to AD 1 are represented as negative.  the  date  for
       the  end  of  the  era.   This  has  the  same  format  as
       start_date except the two special values -* and +*, denote
       that the end date is the beginning of time, and the end of

                                                                1

       string for formatting the year in the era

       Multiple  era  segments may be specified.  Additional seg-
       ments may be added using the backlash (\) character  as  a
       continuation character for the era.
