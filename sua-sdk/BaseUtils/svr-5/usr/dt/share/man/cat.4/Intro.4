       This section outlines the formats of various files.  The C
       structure declarations for  the  file  formats  are  given
       where  applicable.   Usually,  the header files containing
       these structure declarations can be found in the  directo-
       ries /usr/include or /usr/include/sys.  For inclusion in C
       language programs, however,  the  syntax  #include  <file-
       name.h> or #include <sys/filename.h> should be used.

       Because the UnixWare operating system allows the existence
       of multiple file system types, there are several instances
       of  multiple manual pages with the same name.  These pages
       all display the name of the file system type to which they
       pertain  in  a  suffix to the section number at the top of
       the manual page.

                                                                1
