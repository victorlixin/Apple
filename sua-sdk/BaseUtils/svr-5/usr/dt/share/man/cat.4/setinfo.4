       setinfo  is  an ASCII file that describes the characteris-
       tics of the set along with information that helps  control
       the  flow  of installation.  It is created by the software
       set developer and is  included  in  the  Set  Installation
       Package  (SIP).   A  SIP is a special purpose package that
       controls the installation and removal of a  set  of  pack-
       ages.

       Each  entry in the setinfo file is a line that consists of
       predefined fields.  Each entry corresponds  to  a  package
       belonging  to  the  set  and  must  contain  the following
       <tab>-separated fields: This field contains  the  abbrevi-
       ated  name  of  the  package.   The abbreviation must be a
       short string (no more than nine characters long) and  must
       conform  to  the file naming rules.  All characters in the
       abbreviation must be alphanumeric and the first  character
       cannot be numeric.  install, new, and all are reserved.

       This  abbreviated name must be the same as the one used in
       This field specifies the number of parts this package con-
       sists  of.  This field contains the character 'y' indicat-
       ing that the package is to  be  installed  as  a  default.
       Conversely,  an 'n' indicates that the package will not be
       installed.  The category under which the package  belongs.
       Release   4   defines  four  categories:  ``application,''
       ``graphics,'' ``system'' and ``utilities.''  All  packages
       must  be  assigned  to  one  of  these categories.  If you
       choose, you can also assign a package to  a  category  you
       defined.   Categories are case-insensitive and may contain
       only alphanumerics.  Each category is limited to 16  char-
       acters.   Text  that  specifies  the package name (maximum
       length of 256 ASCII characters).  This field must  be  the
       same as NAME in

       The order of the packages listed in the setinfo file  must
       reflect  any package dependencies (if any) and must repre-
       sent the order in which the packages  will  occur  on  the
       media  (in the case of datastream).  Any package for which
       there exists a dependency must  be  listed  prior  to  the
