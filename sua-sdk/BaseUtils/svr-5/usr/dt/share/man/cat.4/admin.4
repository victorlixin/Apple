       admin  is  a  generic  name for an ASCII file that defines
       default  installation  actions  by  assigning  values   to
       installation  parameters.  For example, it allows adminis-
       trators to define how to proceed when  the  package  being
       installed already exists on the system.

       /var/sadm/install/admin/default  is the default admin file
       delivered with your  system.   The  default  file  is  not
       writable,  so  to  assign values different from this file,
       create a new admin file.  There are no naming restrictions
       for  admin files.  Name the file when installing a package
       with the -a option of If the -a option is  not  used,  the
       default admin file is used.

       Each  entry  in  the admin file is a line that establishes
       the  value  of  a  parameter  in   the   following   form:
       param=value  Eleven  parameters can be defined in an admin
       file.  A file is not required  to  assign  values  to  all
       eleven  parameters.   If  a  value is not assigned, pkgadd
       asks the installer how to proceed.

       The eleven parameters and their possible values are  shown
       below  except  as  noted.   They  may  be specified in any
       order.  Any of these parameters can be assigned the  value
       ask,  which  means  that,  if  the  situation  occurs, the
       installer is notified and asked to supply instructions  at
       that time.  Indicates the base directory where relocatable
       packages are to  be  installed.   The  value  may  contain
       $PKGINST  to  indicate  a  base  directory that is to be a
       function of the package instance.  Defines a list of users
       to  whom  mail  should be sent following installation of a
       package.  If the list is empty or if the parameter is  not
       present  in  the  admin file, the default value of root is
       used.  The ask value cannot be used with  this  parameter.
       Indicates  resolution  if  the run level (system state) is
       not correct for the installation or removal of a  package.
       Options  are:  Do  not check for run level (system state).
       Abort installation if run level (system state) is not met.
       Specifies  what  to do if an installation expects to over-
       write a previously installed file, thus  creating  a  con-
       flict  between  packages.   Options  are: Do not check for
       conflict; files in conflict will  be  overwritten.   Abort
       installation  if conflict is detected.  Override installa-
       tion of conflicting files; they  will  not  be  installed.
       Checks  for  executables  which will have setuid or setgid
       bits enabled after  installation.   Options  are:  Do  not
       check  for  setuid  executables.   Abort  installation  if
       setuid processes are detected.  Override  installation  of
       setuid  processes;  processes  will  be  installed without
       setuid bits enabled.  Determines if  action  scripts  pro-
       vided  by  package  developers  contain  possible security
       impact.  Options are: Ignore  security  impact  of  action
       scripts.   Abort installation if action scripts may have a

                                                                1

       negative security impact.  Checks to see if a  version  of
       the  package is already partially installed on the system.
       Options are: Do not check for a partially installed  pack-
       age.   Abort installation if a partially installed package
       exists.  Controls resolution if other packages  depend  on
       the  one to be installed.  Options are: Do not check pack-
       age dependencies.  Abort installation if package dependen-
       cies  are  not met.  Controls resolution if other packages
       depend on the one to be  removed.   Options  are:  Do  not
       check  package  dependencies.   Abort  removal  if package
       dependencies are not met.   Controls  resolution  if  disk
       space  requirements for package are not met.  Options are:
       Do not check space requirements (installation fails if  it
       runs  out of space).  Abort installation if space require-
       ments are not met.

       The value ask should not be defined in an admin file  that
       will  be  used  for non-interactive installation (since by
       definition, there is no installer interaction).  Doing  so
       causes installation to fail when input is needed.
