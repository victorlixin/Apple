       The  following  data type is defined through typedef: from
       the terminfo database.

       The term.h header provides a declaration for cur_term.  It
       represents  the  current terminal record from the terminfo
       database that the application has selected by calling

       The <term.h> header contains the variable names listed  in
       the Variable column in the tables found in

       The  following  are declared as functions, and may also be
       defined as macros:  int     del_curterm(TERMINAL  *);  int
       putp(const  char  *);  int    restartterm(char *, int, int
       *);     TERMINAL     *set_curterm(TERMINAL     *);     int
       setupterm(char  *,  int,  int  *);  int    tgetent(char *,
       const char  *);  int     tgetflag(char  *);  int     tget-
       num(char   *);  char   *tgetstr(char  *,  char  **):  char
       *tgoto(char *, int, int); int     tigetflag(char  *);  int

       long,   long);   int      tputs(const  char  *,  int,  int
       (*)(int));

       The  <term.h>  header  defines  the  following  data  type
