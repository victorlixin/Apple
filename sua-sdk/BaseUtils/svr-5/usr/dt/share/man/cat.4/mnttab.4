       The  file  /etc/mnttab  contains information about devices
       that have been mounted by the mount command.  The informa-
       tion  is  in  the following structure, defined in sys/mnt-
       tab.h:  struct   mnttab   {        char      *mnt_special;
            char       *mnt_mountp;        char      *mnt_fstype;
            char    *mnt_mntopts;      char    *mnt_time; };

       The fields in the mount table are space-separated and show
       the block special device, the mount point, the file system
       type of the mounted file system, the  mount  options,  and
       the time at which the file system was mounted.
