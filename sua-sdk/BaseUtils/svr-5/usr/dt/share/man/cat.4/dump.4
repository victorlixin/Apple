       The /etc/default/dump file contains keywords recognized by
       the timeout code.  When the system boots, if  there  is  a
       system  dump  in  the  swap device, the system asks if you
       want to save  the  dump.   After  n  seconds,  the  system
       assumes that you do not.  The dump will be written in 1024
       byte  blocks   unless   otherwise   specified   with   the
       TAPE_BLOCK_SIZE  keyword.   specifies  the preferred block
       size, in bytes, for saving the dump to tape.  blksize must
       be  a  multiple  of  512.  If not defined, TAPE_BLOCK_SIZE
       defaults to 1024.  To maintain  compatibility  with  other
       commands  that  access  the  tape  device, only change the
       default value if the tape device does not support  writing
       1024  byte  blocks.   specifies the number of seconds that
       the system should wait before timing out.  If n  is  zero,
       the save the dump question is never asked.  If the line is
       missing from the file or if n is  a  negative  value,  the
       system  waits forever.  Otherwise, the system waits n sec-
       onds.
