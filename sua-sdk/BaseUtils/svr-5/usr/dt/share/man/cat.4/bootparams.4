       The bootparams file contains a list of client entries that
       diskless clients use for booting.

       Corresponding  NIS  map  containing  pathnames  of   files
       clients need during rebooting.

UUssaaggee
       For each diskless client, the entry contains the following
       information: name of client list of keys, server names and
       pathnames

       The  first field contains the name of the diskless client.
       The subsequent field is a list of keys, names of  servers,
       and pathnames.  Fields are delineated with TAB characters.

       If the client entry specifies a + (plus) and  the  Network
       Information  Service  (NIS)  is installed and running, the
       NIS map bootparams on the NIS server will be used  instead
       of /etc/bootparams.
