       holidays contains information that accounting commands use
       to identify prime and  non-prime  computing  hours.   This
       information  is  used to divide user cpu usage and connec-
       tion time into prime and non-prime time.

       All lines in the holidays file that begin with an asterisk
       (*)  are comment lines.  The first non-comment line of the
       holidays file must list the year,  the  beginning  of  the
       prime-time  period,  and the end of the prime-time period.
       Prime time is defined as time a  specified  interval  that
       occurs  every day, except on Saturdays, Sundays, and holi-
       days listed in the holidays file.  For example,  the  fol-
       lowing  line indicates that the file is for 1992, and that
       prime time starts at 8:00AM and ends at 6:00PM.   Time  is
       given in 24-hour clocktime.  1992 0800 1800

       Each  of the remaining non-commented lines lists one holi-
       day.  These lines must begin with the date of the  holiday
       in mm/dd format.  All remaining information on the line is
       ignored, so a description of the  holiday  can  be  given.
       The  following  are  examples  of  holiday lines: 1/1  New
       Year's Day 5/25 Memorial Day

       which is equivalent to 1/1 5/25

       The holidays file should be updated at  the  end  of  each
       year.   If the holidays file specifies a year prior to the
       current year, or the end of the current year is near, then
       the  accounting  commands  that use the holidays file will
       issue a message stating that it needs to be updated.
