       The  ldbmcat program is used to convert a LDBM database to
       the text LDAP  Directory  Interchange  Format  (LDIF).  It
       opens the given id2entry-file and writes the corresponding
       LDIF output to standard output.

       The id2entry-file is located in the directory specified by
       the  directory  entry in the /usr/bin/slapd.conf (see file
       for a particular daemon configuration. For daemon configu-
       rations created by the LDAP Manager, they are located in a
       directory under /var/ldap/databases/id  where  id  is  the
       identifier of a particular daemon.

       See for more details on using this program.

   OOppttiioonnss
       Specifies  that ldbmcat should not print entry IDs when it
       dumps out the database. Note that this is essential if you
       are  going to use the LDIF format produced as input to for
       example, to create a new index file for use with an exist-
       ing database.

       To  make a text backup of your LDBM database and put it in
       a file called ldif, type: /usr/bin/ldbmcat -n id2entry.dbb
       > ldif To create a new index for the mail attribute, type:
       /usr/bin/ldbmcat id2entry.dbb >  ldif  /usr/bin/ldif2index
       -i  ldif -f slapd-config-file mail Note that should not be
       running (at least, not in read-write  mode)  when  you  do
       this, in order to ensure consistency of the database.
