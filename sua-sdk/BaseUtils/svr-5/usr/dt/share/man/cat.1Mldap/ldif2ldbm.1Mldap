       These programs are used to convert a database in text LDIF
       LDAP  Directory  Interchange  Format  (LDIF)  to  an  LDBM
       database suitable for use by Normally, only  ldif2ldbm  is
       invoked  directly  by  the  user. It will invoke the other
       programs as necessary. Occasionally, it may  be  necessary
       to invoke them by hand. For example, to create a new index
       file for an existing database, the ldif2index program  can
       be  invoked. The program is used to do the reverse conver-
       sion.

       See for more details on using these programs.

       The first three options apply to all four programs. The -j
       option  is  only  for  the ldif2ldbm program.  This option
       specifies the location of the LDIF input  file  containing
       the  database  to convert. It is required.  Turn on debug-
       ging as defined by debug-level. Some general operation and
       status  messages are printed for any value of debug-level.
       debug-level is taken as a bit string, with each bit corre-
       sponding  to  a  different  kind of debugging information.
       See <ldap.h> for details.  This option specifies the slapd
       configuration  file. The default is /etc/slapd.conf.  This
       option only applies to the ldif2ldbm program. It specifies
       the level of parallelism to use when doing the conversion.
       ldif2ldbm invokes several other programs during  the  con-
       version process, most notably one invocation of ldif2index
       for each indexed attribute that appears in the LDIF  input
       file.  The  -j   option  tells ldif2ldbm how many of these
       other programs it should run in parallel. This  can  speed
       up  the  conversion,  but beware of starting too many pro-
       cesses in parallel, all competing for  disk,  memory,  and
       CPU  resources.  The  default is 1.  This option specifies
       the  configuration  file  database  for  which  to   build
       indices.  The  first  database listed is ``1'', the second
       ``2'', and so on.  By default, the first LDBM database  in
       the configuration file is used.
