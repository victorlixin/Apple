       The  ldif program is used to convert arbitrary data to the
       LDAP Directory Interchange Format (LDIF) described in ldif
       reads  data  from  standard input, converts it, and writes
       the corresponding LDIF output to standard output. The out-
       put is suitable for use as a line in an file.

       Without the -b option, ldif considers its input a sequence
       of values to be converted,  one  per  line.  With  the  -b
       option,  ldif  considers  its input as a single raw binary
       value to be converted. This can be useful when  converting
       binary data such as a photo or audio attribute.

       See for more details on using this program.

   OOppttiioonnss
       This option specifies that ldif should interpret its input
       as a single binary value  for  conversion.  Otherwise,  it
       interprets  it as a sequence of lines, with each line con-
       taining a single value.
