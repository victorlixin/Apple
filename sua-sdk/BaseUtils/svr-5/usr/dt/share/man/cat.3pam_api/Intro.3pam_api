       The  Pluggable  Authentication Modules (PAM) API forms the
       basis of the  single  sign-on  service  specified  by  the
       X/Open  Single  Sign-On  Service (XSSO) specification pub-
       lished by The Open Group.  It is independent of the mecha-
       nisms used for authentication.  Such authentication mecha-
       nisms are implemented as service modules that  conform  to
       the system programming interface that is documented in the
       manual pages.

       The manual pages in this section (3pam_api)  comprise  the
       functional interface that applications and service modules
       should use to access  the  single  sign-on  service.   The
       functions can be further divided into six groups according
       to the operation that is required: The following functions
       allow  an  application  to  access a service module and to
       communicate with it:
           Start  a  PAM  session
           and obtain a handle to
           access it
           Set data in a module
           Get data from a module
           End a PAM session
       Both applications and service modules can call the follow-
       ing functions to obtain and set the values of  items  that
       are  associated  with  the handle for a PAM session and of
       environment variables that are associated with a user ses-
       sion:
           Set value of a session
           item
           Get value of a session
           item
           Get  the  name  of the
           user and set the value
           of this item.  If nec-
           essary,  the  user  is
           prompted   to   obtain
           this
           Get  a  list  of   PAM
           environment variables
           Set the value of a PAM
           environment variable
           Get the value of a PAM
           environment variable
       Applications or service modules can call the remaining PAM
       framework function to obtain the error message that corre-
       sponds to a PAM error code:
           Return  an  error mes-
           sage string
       An application can call the following functions to authen-
       ticate a user and to set their credentials:

                                                                1

           Verify  a user's iden-
           tity  in  the  primary
           sign-on domain
           Verify  a user's iden-
           tity  in  a  secondary
           sign-on  domain  based
           on information  recov-
           ered  from  a  mapping
           module
           Set the credentials of
           an authenticated user
       An  application  can  call the following function to check
       that a user may use a sign-on service:
           Verify that a user may
           access their account
       An  application  can call the following functions to start
       and end a session for an authenticated user:
           Start a user session
           Terminate a user  ses-
           sion
       An application can call the following function to change a
       user's password (their authentication token):
           Update a user's  pass-
           word
       Applications  can  call  the following functions to obtain
       and update user names and passwords in  secondary  sign-on
       domains  that  are  associated  with a user in the primary
       sign-on domain:
                                                              Get a user  identifier
                                                              for  a secondary sign-
                                                              on domain
                                                              Set a user  identifier
                                                              for  a secondary sign-
                                                              on domain

       Get a user's password for a secondary sign-on domain
                                                              Set a user's  password
                                                              for  a secondary sign-
                                                              on domain
