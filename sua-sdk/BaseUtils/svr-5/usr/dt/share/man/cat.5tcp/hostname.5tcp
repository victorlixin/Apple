       Hostnames  are  domains.  A domain is a hierarchical, dot-
       separated list of subdomains.  For  example,  the  machine
       monet,  in  the Berkeley subdomain of the EDU subdomain of
       the Internet Domain Name System would  be  represented  as
       monet.Berkeley.EDU (with no trailing dot).

       Hostnames  are  often  used with network client and server
       programs, which must generally translate the  name  to  an
       address  for  use.  (This task is usually performed by the
       library routine The default method for resolving hostnames
       by the Internet name resolver is to follow RFC1535's secu-
       rity recommendations. Actions can be taken by the adminis-
       trator  to  override these recommendations and to have the
       resolver  behave  the   same   as   earlier,   non-RFC1535
       resolvers.   The default method (using RFC1535 guidelines)
       follows.

       If the name consists of a single component (that is,  con-
       tains no dot), and if the environment variable HOSTALIASES
       is set to the name of a file, then that file  is  searched
       for  a string matching the input hostname. The file should
       consist of lines made  up  of  two  strings  separated  by
       white-space, the first of which is the hostname alias, and
       the second of which is the complete hostname to be substi-
       tuted for that alias. If a case-insensitive match is found
       between the hostname to be resolved and the first field of
       a line in the file, the substituted name is looked up with
       no further processing.

       If there is at least one dot in the name, then the name is
       first  tried  as-is.   The  number  of  dots to cause this
       action is configurable by setting the threshold using  the
       ndots  option  in  /etc/resolv.conf (the default is 1). If
       the name ends with a dot, the trailing dot is removed, and
       the remaining name is looked up (regardless of the setting
       of the ndots option), without further processing.

       If the input name does not end with a trailing dot, it  is
       looked  up  by searching through a list of domains until a
       match is found.  If  neither  the  search  option  in  the
       /etc/resolv.conf file or the LOCALDOMAIN environment vari-
       able is used, then the search  list  of  domains  contains
       only  the  full  domain specified by the domain option (in
       /etc/resolv.conf) or the domain used in the local hostname
       (see  and  For  example,  if  the  domain option is set to
       CS.Berkeley.EDU then only CS.Berkeley.EDU will be  in  the
       search  list, and this will be the only domain appended to
       the partial hostname. For example, if lithium is the  name
       to  be  resolved,  this would make lithium.CS.Berkeley.EDU
       the only name to be tried using the search list.

       If the search option is used in /etc/resolv.conf,  or  the
       environment  variable LOCALDOMAIN is set by the user, then

                                                                1

hostname(5tcp)                                     hostname(5tcp)

       the search list will include what is set by these methods.
       For    example,    if    the   search   option   contained
       CS.Berkeley.EDU CChem.Berkeley.EDU Berkeley.EDU  then  the
       partial hostname (for example, lithium) will be tried with
       each domain name appended (in the same  order  specified);
       the   resulting   hostnames   that  would  be  tried  are:
       lithium.CS.Berkeley.EDU         lithium.CChem.Berkeley.EDU
       lithium.Berkeley.EDU

       The  environment variable LOCALDOMAIN overrides the search
       and domain options, and if both search and domain  options
       are  present in the resolver configuration file, then only
       the last one listed is used (see

       If the name was not previously tried as-is  (that  is,  it
       fell below the ndots threshold, or did not contain a dot),
       then the name as originally provided is attempted.
