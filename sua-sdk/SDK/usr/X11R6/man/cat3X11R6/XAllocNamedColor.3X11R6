    The XXAAllllooccCCoolloorr function allocates a read-only colormap entry
    corresponding to the closest RGB value supported by the hardware.
    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorr returns the pixel value of the color closest to the specified
    RGB elements supported by the hardware and returns the RGB value actually
    used. The corresponding colormap cell is read-only. In addition,
    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorr returns nonzero if it succeeded or zero if it failed. Multiple
    clients that request the same effective RGB value can be assigned the same
    read-only entry, thus allowing entries to be shared. When the last client
    deallocates a shared cell, it is deallocated. XXAAllllooccCCoolloorr does not use or
    affect the flags in the XXCCoolloorr structure.

    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorr can generate a BadColor error.

    The XXAAllllooccNNaammeeddCCoolloorr function looks up the named color with respect to the
    screen that is associated with the specified colormap. It returns both the
    exact database definition and the closest color supported by the screen.
    The allocated color cell is read-only. The pixel value is returned in
    screen_def_return. If the color name is not in the Host Portable Character
    Encoding, the result is implementation-dependent. Use of uppercase or
    lowercase does not matter. If screen_def_return and exact_def_return point
    to the same structure, the pixel field will be set correctly, but the
    color values are undefined. XXAAllllooccNNaammeeddCCoolloorr returns nonzero if a cell is
    allocated; otherwise, it returns zero.

    XXAAllllooccNNaammeeddCCoolloorr can generate a BadColor error.

    delim %% The XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrCCeellllss function allocates read/write color cells.
    The number of colors must be positive and the number of planes
    nonnegative, or a BadValue error results. If ncolors and nplanes are
    requested, then ncolors pixels and nplane plane masks are returned. No
    mask will have any bits set to 1 in common with any other mask or with any
    of the pixels. By ORing together each pixel with zero or more masks,
    ncolors * %2 sup nplanes% distinct pixels can be produced. All of these
    are allocated writable by the request. For GrayScale or PseudoColor, each
    mask has exactly one bit set to 1. For DirectColor, each has exactly three
    bits set to 1. If contig is True and if all masks are ORed together, a
    single contiguous set of bits set to 1 will be formed for GrayScale or
    PseudoColor and three contiguous sets of bits set to 1 (one within each
    pixel subfield) for DirectColor. The RGB values of the allocated entries
    are undefined. XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrCCeellllss returns nonzero if it succeeded or zero if
    it failed.

    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrCCeellllss can generate BadColor and BadValue errors.

    delim %% The specified ncolors must be positive; and nreds, ngreens, and
    nblues must be nonnegative, or a BadValue error results. If ncolors
    colors, nreds reds, ngreens greens, and nblues blues are requested,
    ncolors pixels are returned; and the masks have nreds, ngreens, and nblues
    bits set to 1, respectively. If contig is True, each mask will have a
    contiguous set of bits set to 1. No mask will have any bits set to 1 in
    common with any other mask or with any of the pixels. For DirectColor,
    each mask will lie within the corresponding pixel subfield. By ORing
    together subsets of masks with each pixel value, ncolors * %2 sup
    (nreds+ngreens+nblues)% distinct pixel values can be produced. All of
    these are allocated by the request. However, in the colormap, there are
    only ncolors * %2 sup nreds% independent red entries, ncolors * %2 sup
    ngreens% independent green entries, and ncolors * %2 sup nblues%
    independent blue entries. This is true even for PseudoColor. When the
    colormap entry of a pixel value is changed (using XXSSttoorreeCCoolloorrss,
    XXSSttoorreeCCoolloorr, or XXSSttoorreeNNaammeeddCCoolloorr), the pixel is decomposed according to
    the masks, and the corresponding independent entries are updated.
    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrPPllaanneess returns nonzero if it succeeded or zero if it failed.

    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrPPllaanneess can generate BadColor and BadValue errors.

    The XXFFrreeeeCCoolloorrss function frees the cells represented by pixels whose
    values are in the pixels array. The planes argument should not have any
    bits set to 1 in common with any of the pixels. The set of all pixels is
    produced by ORing together subsets of the planes argument with the pixels.
    The request frees all of these pixels that were allocated by the client
    (using XXAAllllooccCCoolloorr, XXAAllllooccNNaammeeddCCoolloorr, XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrCCeellllss, and
    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrPPllaanneess). Note that freeing an individual pixel obtained from
    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrPPllaanneess may not actually allow it to be reused until all of its
    related pixels are also freed. Similarly, a read-only entry is not
    actually freed until it has been freed by all clients, and if a client
    allocates the same read-only entry multiple times, it must free the entry
    that many times before the entry is actually freed.

    All specified pixels that are allocated by the client in the colormap are
    freed, even if one or more pixels produce an error. If a specified pixel
    is not a valid index into the colormap, a BadValue error results. If a
    specified pixel is not allocated by the client (that is, is unallocated or
    is only allocated by another client) or if the colormap was created with
    all entries writable (by passing AllocAll to XXCCrreeaatteeCCoolloorrmmaapp), a BadAccess
    error results. If more than one pixel is in error, the one that gets
    reported is arbitrary.

    XXFFrreeeeCCoolloorrss can generate BadAccess, BadColor, and BadValue errors.

    BadAccess
        A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not already
        allocate.

    BadAccess
        A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.

    BadColor
        A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Colormap.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
