    directories
        Specifies the directory path used to look for a font. Setting the path
        to the empty list restores the default path defined for the X server.

    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    list
        Specifies the array of strings you want to free.

    ndirs
        Specifies the number of directories in the path.

    npaths_return
        Returns the number of strings in the font path array.

    The XXSSeettFFoonnttPPaatthh function defines the directory search path for font
    lookup. There is only one search path per X server, not one per client.
    The encoding and interpretation of the strings are implementation-
    dependent, but typically they specify directories or font servers to be
    searched in the order listed. An X server is permitted to cache font
    information internally; for example, it might cache an entire font from a
    file and not check on subsequent opens of that font to see if the
    underlying font file has changed. However, when the font path is changed,
    the X server is guaranteed to flush all cached information about fonts for
    which there currently are no explicit resource IDs allocated. The meaning
    of an error from this request is implementation-dependent.

    XXSSeettFFoonnttPPaatthh can generate a BadValue error.

    The XXGGeettFFoonnttPPaatthh function allocates and returns an array of strings
    containing the search path. The contents of these strings are
    implementation-dependent and are not intended to be interpreted by client
    applications. When it is no longer needed, the data in the font path
    should be freed by using XXFFrreeeeFFoonnttPPaatthh.

    The XXFFrreeeeFFoonnttPPaatthh function frees the data allocated by XXGGeettFFoonnttPPaatthh.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
