    exclusive
        Specifies whether user events should be dispatched exclusively to this
        widget or also to previous widgets in the cascade.

    spring_loaded
        Specifies whether this widget was popped up because the user pressed a
        pointer button.

    w
        Specifies the widget to add to or remove from the modal cascade.

    The XXttAAddddGGrraabb function appends the widget (and associated parameters) to
    the modal cascade and checks that exclusive is True if spring_loaded is
    True. If these are not True, XXttAAddddGGrraabb generates an error.

    The modal cascade is used by XXttDDiissppaattcchhEEvveenntt when it tries to dispatch a
    user event. When at least one modal widget is in the widget cascade,
    XXttDDiissppaattcchhEEvveenntt first determines if the event should be delivered. It
    starts at the most recent cascade entry and follows the cascade up to and
    including the most recent cascade entry added with the exclusive parameter
    True.

    This subset of the modal cascade along with all descendants of these
    widgets comprise the active subset. User events that occur outside the
    widgets in this subset are ignored or remapped. Modal menus with submenus
    generally add a submenu widget to the cascade with exclusive False. Modal
    dialog boxes that need to restrict user input to the most deeply nested
    dialog box add a subdialog widget to the cascade with exclusive True. User
    events that occur within the active subset are delivered to the
    appropriate widget, which is usually a child or further descendant of the
    modal widget.

    Regardless of where on the screen they occur, remap events are always
    delivered to the most recent widget in the active subset of the cascade
    that has spring_loaded True, if any such widget exists.

    The XXttRReemmoovveeGGrraabb function removes widgets from the modal cascade starting
    at the most recent widget up to and including the specified widget. It
    issues an error if the specified widget is not on the modal cascade.
