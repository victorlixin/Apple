    The XXAAllllooccSSttaannddaarrddCCoolloorrmmaapp function allocates and returns a pointer to a
    XXSSttaannddaarrddCCoolloorrmmaapp structure. Note that all fields in the XXSSttaannddaarrddCCoolloorrmmaapp
    structure are initially set to zero. If insufficient memory is available,
    XXAAllllooccSSttaannddaarrddCCoolloorrmmaapp returns NULL. To free the memory allocated to this
    structure, use XXFFrreeee.

    The XXSSeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss function replaces the RGB colormap definition in the
    specified property on the named window. If the property does not already
    exist, XXSSeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss sets the RGB colormap definition in the specified
    property on the named window. The property is stored with a type of
    RGB_COLOR_MAP and a format of 32. Note that it is the caller's
    responsibility to honor the ICCCM restriction that only RGB_DEFAULT_MAP
    contain more than one definition.

    The XXSSeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss function usually is only used by window or session
    managers. To create a standard colormap, follow this procedure:
   1.     Open a new connection to the same server.
   2.     Grab the server.
   3.     See if the property is on the property list of the root window for
          the screen.
   4.     If the desired property is not present:
          *     Create a colormap (unless you are using the default colormap of the
                screen).
          *     Determine the color characteristics of the visual.
          *     Allocate cells in the colormap (or create it with AllocAll).
          *     Call XXSSttoorreeCCoolloorrss to store appropriate color values in the colormap.
          *     Fill in the descriptive members in the XXSSttaannddaarrddCCoolloorrmmaapp structure.
          *     Attach the property to the root window.
          *     Use XXSSeettCClloosseeDDoowwnnMMooddee to make the resource permanent.
   5.     Ungrab the server.

    XXSSeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom, and BadWindow errors.

    The XXGGeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss function returns the RGB colormap definitions stored
    in the specified property on the named window. If the property exists, is
    of type RGB_COLOR_MAP, is of format 32, and is long enough to contain a
    colormap definition, XXGGeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss allocates and fills in space for the
    returned colormaps and returns a nonzero status. If the visualid is not
    present, XXGGeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss assumes the default visual for the screen on
    which the window is located; if the killid is not present, None is
    assumed, which indicates that the resources cannot be released. Otherwise,
    none of the fields are set, and XXGGeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss returns a zero status.
    Note that it is the caller's responsibility to honor the ICCCM restriction
    that only RGB_DEFAULT_MAP contain more than one definition.

    XXGGeettRRGGBBCCoolloorrmmaappss can generate BadAtom and BadWindow errors.

    The XXSSttaannddaarrddCCoolloorrmmaapp structure contains:

    /* Hints */
    #define ReleaseByFreeingColormap ( (XID) 1L)
    /* Values */

    typedef struct {
         Colormap colormap;
         unsigned long red_max;
         unsigned long red_mult;
         unsigned long green_max;
         unsigned long green_mult;
         unsigned long blue_max;
         unsigned long blue_mult;
         unsigned long base_pixel;
         VisualID visualid;
         XID killid;
    } XStandardColormap;

    The colormap member is the colormap created by the XXCCrreeaatteeCCoolloorrmmaapp
    function. The red_max, green_max, and blue_max members give the maximum
    red, green, and blue values, respectively. Each color coefficient ranges
    from zero to its max, inclusive. For example, a common colormap allocation
    is 3/3/2 (3 planes for red, 3 planes for green, and 2 planes for blue).
    This colormap would have red_max = 7, green_max = 7, and blue_max = 3. An
    alternate allocation that uses only 216 colors is red_max = 5, green_max =
    5, and blue_max = 5.

    The red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult members give the scale factors
    used to compose a full pixel value. (See the discussion of the base_pixel
    members for further information.) For a 3/3/2 allocation, red_mult might
    be 32, green_mult might be 4, and blue_mult might be 1. For a 6-colors-
    each allocation, red_mult might be 36, green_mult might be 6, and
    blue_mult might be 1.

    The base_pixel member gives the base pixel value used to compose a full
    pixel value. Usually, the base_pixel is obtained from a call to the
    XXAAllllooccCCoolloorrPPllaanneess function. Given integer red, green, and blue
    coefficients in their appropriate ranges, one then can compute a
    corresponding pixel value by using the following expression:

    (r * red_mult + g * green_mult + b * blue_mult + base_pixel) & 0xFFFFFFFF

    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and
    base_pixel members are defined. The other members are ignored. To compute
    a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:

    (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) & 0xFFFFFFFF

    Negative multipliers can be represented by converting the 2's complement
    representation of the multiplier into an unsigned long and storing the
    result in the appropriate _mult field. The step of masking by 0xFFFFFFFF
    effectively converts the resulting positive multiplier into a negative
    one. The masking step will take place automatically on many machine
    architectures, depending on the size of the integer type used to do the
    computation,

    The visualid member gives the ID number of the visual from which the
    colormap was created. The killid member gives a resource ID that indicates
    whether the cells held by this standard colormap are to be released by
    freeing the colormap ID or by calling the XXKKiillllCClliieenntt function on the
    indicated resource. (Note that this method is necessary for allocating out
    of an existing colormap.)

    The properties containing the XXSSttaannddaarrddCCoolloorrmmaapp information have the type
    RGB_COLOR_MAP.

    BadAlloc
        The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server memory.

    BadAtom
        A value for an Atom argument does not name a defined Atom.

    BadWindow
        A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
