    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    device
        Specifies the device whose control is to be interrogated or modified.

    controlType
        Specifies the type of control to be interrogated or changed.

    control
        Specifies the address of an XDeviceControl structure that contains the
        new values for the Device.

    These requests are provided to manipulate those input devices that support
    device control. A BadMatch error will be generated if the requested device
    does not support any device controls.

    Valid device control types that can be used with these requests include
    the following:

    DEVICE_RESOLUTION
        Queries or changes the resolution of valuators on input devices.

    The XXGGeettDDeevviicceeCCoonnttrrooll request returns a pointer to an XDeviceControl
    structure.

    XXGGeettDDeevviicceeCCoonnttrrooll can generate a BadDevice or BadMatch error.

    The XXCChhaannggeeDDeevviicceeCCoonnttrrooll request modifies the values of one control on the
    specified device. The control is identified by the id field of the
    XDeviceControl structure that is passed with the request.

    XXCChhaannggeeDDeevviicceeCCoonnttrrooll can generate a BadDevice, BadMatch, or BadValue
    error.

    Each control is described by a structure specific to that control. These
    structures are defined in the file XInput.h.

    XDeviceControl is a generic structure that contains two fields that are at
    the beginning of each class of control:

    typedef struct {
            XID class;
            int length;
    } XDeviceControl;

    The XDeviceResolutionState structure defines the information that is
    returned for device resolution for devices with valuators.

    typedef struct {
            XID     control;
            int     length;
            int     num_valuators;
            int     *resolutions;
            int     *min_resolutions;
            int     *max_resolutions;
    } XDeviceResolutionState;

    The XDeviceResolutionControl structure defines the attributes that can be
    controlled for keyboard Devices.

    typedef struct {
            XID     control;
            int     length;
            int     first_valuator;
            int     num_valuators;
            int     *resolutions;
    } XDeviceResolutionControl;

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist
        or has not been opened by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error
        may also occur if some other client has caused the specified device to
        become the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
        XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee or XXCChhaannggeePPooiinntteerrDDeevviiccee requests.

    BadMatch
        This error may occur if an XXGGeettDDeevviicceeCCoonnttrrooll request was made
        specifying a device that has no controls or an XXCChhaannggeeDDeevviicceeCCoonnttrrooll
        request was made with an XDeviceControl structure that contains an
        invalid Device type. It may also occur if an invalid combination of
        mask bits is specified (DvKey but no DvAutoRepeatMode for keyboard
        Devices), or if an invalid KeySym is specified for a string Device.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        XXCChhaannggeeDDeevviicceeCCoonnttrrooll request. Unless a specific range is specified for
        an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is
        accepted. Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate
        this error.
