    XSelectionEvent - SelectionNotify event structure

  SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS

    The structure for SelectionNotify events contains:

    typedef struct {
         int type;                /* SelectionNotify */
         unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
         Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent
    request */
         Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
         Window requestor;
         Atom selection;
         Atom target;
         Atom property;           /* atom or None */
         Time time;
    } XSelectionEvent;

    When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

    The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
    identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
    event to a client application, it sends an XXGGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoosseeEEvveenntt structure
    with the type member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
    pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set
    to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request. The serial
    member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded
    from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
    member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

    The requestor member is set to the window associated with the requestor of
    the selection. The selection member is set to the atom that indicates the
    selection. For example, PRIMARY is used for the primary selection. The
    target member is set to the atom that indicates the converted type. For
    example, PIXMAP is used for a pixmap. The property member is set to the
    atom that indicates which property the result was stored on. If the
    conversion failed, the property member is set to None. The time member is
    set to the time the conversion took place and can be a timestamp or
    CurrentTime.
