    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    window
        Specifies the window whose dont-propagate-list is to be queried or
        modified.

    event_list
        Specifies a pointer to a list of event classes.

    mode
        Specifies the mode. You can pass AddToList , or DeleteFromList.

    count
        Specifies the number of event classes in the list.

    that should not be propagated to ancestors of the event window. This
    request allows extension events to be added to or deleted from that list.
    By default, all events are propagated to ancestor windows. Once modified,
    the list remains modified for the life of the window. Events are not
    removed from the list because the client that added them has terminated.

    Suppression of event propagation is not allowed for all input extension
    events. If a specified event class is one that cannot be suppressed, a
    BadClass error will result. Events that can be suppressed include
    DeviceKeyPress, DeviceKeyRelease, DeviceButtonPress, DeviceButtonRelease,
    DeviceMotionNotify, ProximityIn, and ProximityOut.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist
        or has not been opened by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error
        may also occur if some other client has caused the specified device to
        become the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
        XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee or XXCChhaannggeePPooiinntteerrDDeevviiccee requests.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    BadWindow
        An invalid window id was specified.

    BadClass
        An invalid event class was specified.
