    close_mode
        Specifies the client close-down mode. You can pass DestroyAll,
        RetainPermanent, or RetainTemporary.

    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    resource
        Specifies any resource associated with the client that you want to
        destroy or AllTemporary.

    The XXSSeettCClloosseeDDoowwnnMMooddee defines what will happen to the client's resources
    at connection close. A connection starts in DestroyAll mode. For
    information on what happens to the client's resources when the close_mode
    argument is RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary, see section 2.6.

    XXSSeettCClloosseeDDoowwnnMMooddee can generate a BadValue error.

    The XXKKiillllCClliieenntt function forces a close down of the client that created
    the resource if a valid resource is specified. If the client has already
    terminated in either RetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode, all of the
    client's resources are destroyed. If AllTemporary is specified, the
    resources of all clients that have terminated in RetainTemporary are
    destroyed (see section 2.5). This permits implementation of window manager
    facilities that aid debugging. A client can set its close-down mode to
    RetainTemporary. If the client then crashes, its windows would not be
    destroyed. The programmer can then inspect the application's window tree
    and use the window manager to destroy the zombie windows.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
