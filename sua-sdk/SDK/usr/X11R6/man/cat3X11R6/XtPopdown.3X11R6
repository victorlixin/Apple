    call_data
        Specifies the callback data, which is not used by this procedure.

    client_data
        Specifies a pointer to the XtPopdownID structure.

    popup_shell
        Specifies the widget shell to pop down.

    shell_name
        Specifies the name of the widget shell to pop down.

    w
        Specifies the widget.

    The XXttPPooppddoowwnn function performs the following:

    *     Calls XXttCChheecckkSSuubbccllaassss to ensure popup_shell is a subclass of Shell.
    *     Checks that popup_shell is currently popped_up; otherwise, it
          generates an error.
    *     Unmaps popup_shell's window.
    *     If popup_shell's grab_kind is either XtGrabNonexclusive or
          XtGrabExclusive, it calls XXttRReemmoovveeGGrraabb.
    *     Sets pop-up shell's popped_up field to False.
    *     Calls the callback procedures on the shell's popdown_callback list.

    The XXttCCaallllbbaacckkPPooppddoowwnn function casts the client data parameter to an
    XtPopdownID pointer:

    typedef struct {
         Widget shell_widget;
         Widget enable_widget;
    } XtPopdownIDRec, *XtPopdownID;

    The shell_widget is the pop-up shell to pop down, and the enable_widget is
    the widget that was used to pop it up.

    XXttCCaallllbbaacckkPPooppddoowwnn calls XXttPPooppddoowwnn with the specified shell_widget and then
    calls XXttSSeettSSeennssiittiivvee to resensitize the enable_widget.

    If a shell name is not given, MenuPopdown calls XXttPPooppddoowwnn with the widget
    for which the translation is specified. If a shell_name is specified in
    the translation table, MenuPopdown tries to find the shell by looking up
    the widget tree starting at the parent of the widget in which it is
    invoked. If it finds a shell with the specified name in the pop-up
    children of that parent, it pops down the shell; otherwise, it moves up
    the parent chain as needed. If MenuPopdown gets to the application top-
    level shell widget and cannot find a matching shell, it generates an
    error.
