    If the specified window is mapped, XXRReeppaarreennttWWiinnddooww automatically performs
    an UnmapWindow request on it, removes it from its current position in the
    hierarchy, and inserts it as the child of the specified parent. The window
    is placed in the stacking order on top with respect to sibling windows.

    After reparenting the specified window, XXRReeppaarreennttWWiinnddooww causes the X
    server to generate a ReparentNotify event. The override_redirect member
    returned in this event is set to the window's corresponding attribute.
    Window manager clients usually should ignore this window if this member is
    set to True. Finally, if the specified window was originally mapped, the X
    server automatically performs a MapWindow request on it.

    The X server performs normal exposure processing on formerly obscured
    windows. The X server might not generate Expose events for regions from
    the initial UnmapWindow request that are immediately obscured by the final
    MapWindow request. A BadMatch error results if:
    *     The new parent window is not on the same screen as the old parent
          window.
    *     The new parent window is the specified window or an inferior of the
          specified window.
    *     The new parent is InputOnly, and the window is not.
    *     The specified window has a ParentRelative background, and the new
          parent window is not the same depth as the specified window.

    XXRReeppaarreennttWWiinnddooww can generate BadMatch and BadWindow errors.
