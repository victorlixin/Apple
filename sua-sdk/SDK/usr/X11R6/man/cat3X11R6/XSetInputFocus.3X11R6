    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    focus
        Specifies the window, PointerRoot, or None.

    focus_return
        Returns the focus window, PointerRoot, or None.

    revert_to
        Specifies where the input focus reverts to if the window becomes not
        viewable. You can pass RevertToParent, RevertToPointerRoot, or
        RevertToNone.

    revert_to_return
        Returns the current focus state (RevertToParent, RevertToPointerRoot,
        or RevertToNone).

    time
        Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp or CurrentTime.

    The XXSSeettIInnppuuttFFooccuuss function changes the input focus and the last-focus-
    change time. It has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the
    current last-focus-change time or is later than the current X server time.
    Otherwise, the last-focus-change time is set to the specified time
    (CurrentTime is replaced by the current X server time). XXSSeettIInnppuuttFFooccuuss
    causes the X server to generate FocusIn and FocusOut events.

    Depending on the focus argument, the following occurs:
    *     If focus is None, all keyboard events are discarded until a new
          focus window is set, and the revert_to argument is ignored.
    *     If focus is a window, it becomes the keyboard's focus window. If a
          generated keyboard event would normally be reported to this window
          or one of its inferiors, the event is reported as usual. Otherwise,
          the event is reported relative to the focus window.
    *     If focus is PointerRoot, the focus window is dynamically taken to be
          the root window of whatever screen the pointer is on at each
          keyboard event. In this case, the revert_to argument is ignored.

    The specified focus window must be viewable at the time XXSSeettIInnppuuttFFooccuuss is
    called, or a BadMatch error results. If the focus window later becomes not
    viewable, the X server evaluates the revert_to argument to determine the
    new focus window as follows:

    *     If revert_to is RevertToParent, the focus reverts to the parent (or
          the closest viewable ancestor), and the new revert_to value is taken
          to be RevertToNone.
    *     If revert_to is RevertToPointerRoot or RevertToNone, the focus
          reverts to PointerRoot or None, respectively. When the focus
          reverts, the X server generates FocusIn and FocusOut events, but the
          last-focus-change time is not affected.

    XXSSeettIInnppuuttFFooccuuss can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

    The XXGGeettIInnppuuttFFooccuuss function returns the focus window and the current focus
    state.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    BadWindow
        A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
