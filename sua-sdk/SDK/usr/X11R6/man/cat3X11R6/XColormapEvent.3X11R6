    XColormapEvent - ColormapNotify event structure

  SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS

    The structure for ColormapNotify events contains:

    typedef struct {
         int type;                /* ColormapNotify */
         unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
         Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent
    request */
         Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
         Window window;
         Colormap colormap;       /* colormap or None */
         Bool new;
         int state;               /* ColormapInstalled, ColormapUninstalled */
    } XColormapEvent;

    When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

    The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
    identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
    event to a client application, it sends an XXGGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoosseeEEvveenntt structure
    with the type member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
    pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set
    to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request. The serial
    member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded
    from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
    member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

    The window member is set to the window whose associated colormap is
    changed, installed, or uninstalled. For a colormap that is changed,
    installed, or uninstalled, the colormap member is set to the colormap
    associated with the window. For a colormap that is changed by a call to
    XXFFrreeeeCCoolloorrmmaapp, the colormap member is set to None. The new member is set
    to indicate whether the colormap for the specified window was changed or
    installed or uninstalled and can be True or False. If it is True, the
    colormap was changed. If it is False, the colormap was installed or
    uninstalled. The state member is always set to indicate whether the
    colormap is installed or uninstalled and can be ColormapInstalled or
    ColormapUninstalled.
