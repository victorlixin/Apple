    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    device
        Specifies the device to be used as the X pointer.

    xaxis
        Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X pointer x-axis.

    yaxis
        Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X pointer y-axis.

    The XXCChhaannggeePPooiinntteerrDDeevviiccee request causes the server to use the specified
    device as the X pointer. The device must have been opened by the client
    via XXOOppeennDDeevviiccee or a BadDevice error will result. The device must support
    input class Valuators or a BadMatch error will result. If the
    implementation does not support use of the specified device as the X
    pointer, a BadDevice error will result.

    If the specified device is grabbed by another client, AlreadyGrabbed is
    returned. If the specified device is frozen by a grab on another device,
    GrabFrozen is returned. If the request is successful, Success is returned.

    If the request succeeds, a ChangeDeviceNotify event is sent to all clients
    that have selected that event. A MappingNotify event with request =
    MappingPointer is sent to all clients. The specified device becomes the X
    pointer, and the old X pointer becomes accessible through the input
    extension protocol requests.

    XXCChhaannggeePPooiinntteerrDDeevviiccee can generate a BadDevice or a BadMatch error.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist,
        has not been opened by this client via XOpenInputDevice, or is already
        one of the core X input devices (pointer or keyboard). This error may
        also occur if the server implementation does not support using the
        specified device as the X pointer.

    BadMatch
        This error may occur if an XXCChhaannggeePPooiinntteerrDDeevviiccee request was made
        specifying a device that has less than two valuators, or specifying a
        valuator index beyond the range supported by the device.
