    discard
        Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether XXSSyynncc discards all
        events on the event queue.

    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    mode
        Specifies the mode. You can pass QueuedAlready, QueuedAfterFlush, or
        QueuedAfterReading.

    The XXFFlluusshh function flushes the output buffer. Most client applications
    need not use this function because the output buffer is automatically
    flushed as needed by calls to XXPPeennddiinngg, XXNNeexxttEEvveenntt, and XXWWiinnddoowwEEvveenntt.
    Events generated by the server may be enqueued into the library's event
    queue.

    The XXSSyynncc function flushes the output buffer and then waits until all
    requests have been received and processed by the X server. Any errors
    generated must be handled by the error handler. For each protocol error
    received by Xlib, XXSSyynncc calls the client application's error handling
    routine (see section 11.8.2). Any events generated by the server are
    enqueued into the library's event queue.

    Finally, if you passed False, XXSSyynncc does not discard the events in the
    queue. If you passed True, XXSSyynncc discards all events in the queue,
    including those events that were on the queue before XXSSyynncc was called.
    Client applications seldom need to call XXSSyynncc.

    If mode is QueuedAlready, XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd returns the number of events
    already in the event queue (and never performs a system call). If mode is
    QueuedAfterFlush, XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd returns the number of events already in
    the queue if the number is nonzero. If there are no events in the queue,
    XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd flushes the output buffer, attempts to read more events out
    of the application's connection, and returns the number read. If mode is
    QueuedAfterReading, XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd returns the number of events already in
    the queue if the number is nonzero. If there are no events in the queue,
    XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd attempts to read more events out of the application's
    connection without flushing the output buffer and returns the number read.

    XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd always returns immediately without I/O if there are events
    already in the queue. XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd with mode QueuedAfterFlush is
    identical in behavior to XXPPeennddiinngg. XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd with mode QueuedAlready
    is identical to the XQLength function.

    The XXPPeennddiinngg function returns the number of events that have been received
    from the X server but have not been removed from the event queue. XXPPeennddiinngg
    is identical to XXEEvveennttssQQuueeuueedd with the mode QueuedAfterFlush specified.
