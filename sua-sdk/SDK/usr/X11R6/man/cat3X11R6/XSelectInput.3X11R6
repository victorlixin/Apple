    The XXSSeelleeccttIInnppuutt function requests that the X server report the events
    associated with the specified event mask. Initially, X will not report any
    of these events. Events are reported relative to a window. If a window is
    not interested in a device event, it usually propagates to the closest
    ancestor that is interested, unless the do_not_propagate mask prohibits
    it.

    Setting the event-mask attribute of a window overrides any previous call
    for the same window but not for other clients. Multiple clients can select
    for the same events on the same window with the following restrictions:
    *     Multiple clients can select events on the same window because their
          event masks are disjoint. When the X server generates an event, it
          reports it to all interested clients.
    *     Only one client at a time can select CirculateRequest,
          ConfigureRequest, or MapRequest events, which are associated with
          the event mask SubstructureRedirectMask.
    *     Only one client at a time can select a ResizeRequest event, which is
          associated with the event mask ResizeRedirectMask.
    *     Only one client at a time can select a ButtonPress event, which is
          associated with the event mask ButtonPressMask.

    The server reports the event to all interested clients. XXSSeelleeccttIInnppuutt can
    generate a BadWindow error.
