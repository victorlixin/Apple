    The XXSSeettIICCFFooccuuss function allows a client to notify an input method that
    the focus window attached to the specified input context has received
    keyboard focus. The input method should take action to provide appropriate
    feedback. Complete feedback specification is a matter of user interface
    policy.

    Calling XXSSeettIICCFFooccuuss does not affect the focus window value.

    The XXUUnnsseettIICCFFooccuuss function allows a client to notify an input method that
    the specified input context has lost the keyboard focus and that no more
    input is expected on the focus window attached to that input context. The
    input method should take action to provide appropriate feedback. Complete
    feedback specification is a matter of user interface policy.

    Calling XXUUnnsseettIICCFFooccuuss does not affect the focus window value; the client
    may still receive events from the input method that are directed to the
    focus window.
