    The XXOOppeennDDeevviiccee request makes an input device accessible to a client
    through input extension protocol requests. If successful, it returns a
    pointer to an XXDDeevviiccee structure.

    The XXCClloosseeDDeevviiccee request makes an input device inaccessible to a client
    through input extension protocol requests. Before terminating, and client
    that has opened input devices through the input extension should close
    them via CloseDevice.

    When a client makes an XXCClloosseeDDeevviiccee request, any active grabs that the
    client has on the device are released. Any event selections that the
    client has are deleted, as well as any passive grabs. If the requesting
    client is the last client accessing the device, the server may disable all
    access by X to the device.

    XXOOppeennDDeevviiccee and XXCClloosseeDDeevviiccee can generate a BadDevice error.

    The XDevice structure returned by XXOOppeennDDeevviiccee contains:

    typedef struct {
            XID device_id;
            int num_classes;
            XInputClassInfo *classes;
    } XDevice;

    The classes field is a pointer to an array of XInputClassInfo structures.
    Each element of this array contains an event type base for a class of
    input supported by the specified device. The num_classes field indicates
    the number of elements in the classes array.

    The XInputClassInfo structure contains:

    typedef struct {
            unsigned char input_class;
            unsigned char event_type_base;
    } XInputClassInfo;

    The input_class field identifies one class of input supported by the
    device. Defined types include KeyClass, ButtonClass, ValuatorClass,
    ProximityClass, FeedbackClass, FocusClass, and OtherClass. The
    event_type_base identifies the event type of the first event in that
    class.

    The information contained in the XInputClassInfo structure is used by
    macros to obtain the event classes that clients use in making
    XXSSeelleeccttEExxtteennssiioonnEEvveenntt requests. Currently defined macros include
    DeviceKeyPress, DeviceKeyRelease, DeviceButtonPress, DeviceButtonRelese,
    DeviceMotionNotify, DeviceFocusIn, DeviceFocusOut, ProximityIn,
    ProximityOut, DeviceStateNotify, DeviceMappiingNotify, ChangeDeviceNotify,
    DevicePointerMotionHint, DeviceButton1Motion, DeviceButton2Motion,
    DeviceButton3Motion, DeviceButton4Motion, DeviceButton5Motion,
    DeviceButtonMotion, DeviceOwnerGrabButton, DeviceButtonPressGrab, and
    NoExtensionEvent.

    To obtain the proper event class for a particular device, one of the above
    macros is invoked using the XDevice structure for that device. For
    example,

    DeviceKeyPress (*device, type, eventclass);

    returns the DeviceKeyPress event type and the eventclass for
    DeviceKeyPress events from the specified device.

    This eventclass can then be used in an XXSSeelleeccttEExxtteennssiioonnEEvveenntt request to
    ask the server to send DeviceKeyPress events from this device. When a
    selected event is received via XXNNeexxttEEvveenntt, the type can be used for
    comparison with the type in the event.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist,
        or is the X keyboard or X pointer. This error may also occur if some
        other client has caused the specified device to become the X keyboard
        or X pointer device via the XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee or
