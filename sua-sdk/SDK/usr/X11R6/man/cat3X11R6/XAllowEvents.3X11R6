    The XXAAlllloowwEEvveennttss function releases some queued events if the client has
    caused a device to freeze. It has no effect if the specified time is
    earlier than the last-grab time of the most recent active grab for the
    client or if the specified time is later than the current X server time.

        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
