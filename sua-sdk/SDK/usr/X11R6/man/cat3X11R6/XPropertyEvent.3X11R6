    XPropertyEvent - PropertyNotify event structure

  SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS

    The structure for PropertyNotify events contains:

    typedef struct {
         int type;                /* PropertyNotify */
         unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
         Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent
    request */
         Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
         Window window;
         Atom atom;
         Time time;
         int state;               /* PropertyNewValue or PropertyDelete */
    } XPropertyEvent;

    When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

    The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
    identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
    event to a client application, it sends an XXGGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoosseeEEvveenntt structure
    with the type member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
    pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set
    to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request. The serial
    member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded
    from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
    member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

    The window member is set to the window whose associated property was
    changed. The atom member is set to the property's atom and indicates which
    property was changed or desired. The time member is set to the server time
    when the property was changed. The state member is set to indicate whether
    the property was changed to a new value or deleted and can be
    PropertyNewValue or PropertyDelete. The state member is set to
    PropertyNewValue when a property of the window is changed using
    XXCChhaannggeePPrrooppeerrttyy or XXRRoottaatteeWWiinnddoowwPPrrooppeerrttiieess (even when adding zero-length
    data using XXCChhaannggeePPrrooppeerrttyy) and when replacing all or part of a property
    with identical data using XXCChhaannggeePPrrooppeerrttyy or XXRRoottaatteeWWiinnddoowwPPrrooppeerrttiieess. The
    state member is set to PropertyDelete when a property of the window is
    deleted using XXDDeelleetteePPrrooppeerrttyy or, if the delete argument is True,
    XXGGeettWWiinnddoowwPPrrooppeerrttyy.
