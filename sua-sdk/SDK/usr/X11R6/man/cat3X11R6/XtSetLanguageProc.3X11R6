    app_context
        Specifies the application context in which the language procedure is
        to be used, or NULL.

    proc
        Specifies the language procedure, or NULL.

    client_data
        Specifes addional client data to be passed to the language procedure
        when it is called.

    XXttSSeettLLaanngguuaaggeePPrroocc sets the language procedure that will be called from
    XXttDDiissppllaayyIInniittiiaalliizzee for all subsequent Displays initialized in the
    specified application context. If app_context is NULL, the specified
    language procedure is registered in all application contexts created by
    the calling process, including any future application contexts that may be
    created. If proc is NULL a default language procedure is registered.
    XXttSSeettLLaanngguuaaggeePPrroocc returns the previously registered language procedure. If
    a language procedure has not yet been registered, the return value is
    unspecified but if this return value is used in a subsequent call to
    XXttSSeettLLaanngguuaaggeePPrroocc, it will bcause the default language procedure to be
    registered.

    The default language procdure does the following:
    *     Sets the locale according to the environment. On ANSI C-based
          systems this is done by calling setlocale( LC_ALL, language ). If an
          error is encountered a warning message is issued with XXttWWaarrnniinngg.
    *     Calls XXSSuuppppoorrttssLLooccaallee to verify that the current locale is
          supported. If the locale is not supported, a warning message is
          issued with XXttWWaarrnniinngg and the locale is set to "C".
    *     Calls XXSSeettLLooccaalleeMMooddiiffiieerrss specifying the empty string.
    *     Returns the value of the current locale. On ANSI C-based systems
          this is the return value from a final call to setlocal(LC_ALL,NULL).

    A client wishing to use this mechanism to establish locale can do so by
    calling XXttSSeettLLaanngguuaaggeePPrroocc prior to XtDisplayInitialize.
