    XReparentEvent - ReparentNotify event structure

  SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS

    The structure for ReparentNotify events contains:

    typedef struct {
         int type;                /* ReparentNotify */
         unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
         Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent
    request */
         Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
         Window event;
         Window window;
         Window parent;
         int x, y;
         Bool override_redirect;
    } XReparentEvent;

    When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

    The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
    identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
    event to a client application, it sends an XXGGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoosseeEEvveenntt structure
    with the type member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
    pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set
    to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request. The serial
    member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded
    from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
    member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

    The event member is set either to the reparented window or to the old or
    the new parent, depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify
    was selected. The window member is set to the window that was reparented.
    The parent member is set to the new parent window. The x and y members are
    set to the reparented window's coordinates relative to the new parent
    window's origin and define the upper-left outer corner of the reparented
    window. The override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect
    attribute of the window specified by the window member. Window manager
    clients normally should ignore this window if the override_redirect member
    is True.
