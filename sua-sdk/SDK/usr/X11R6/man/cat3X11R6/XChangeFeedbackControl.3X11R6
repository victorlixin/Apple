    These requests are provided to manipulate those input devices that support
    feedbacks. A BadMatch error will be generated if the requested device does
    not support feedbacks. Whether or not a given device supports feedbacks
    can be determined by examining the information returned by the XXOOppeennDDeevviiccee
    request. For those devices that support feedbacks, XXOOppeennDDeevviiccee will return
    an XInputClassInfo structure with the input_class field equal to the
    constant FeedbackClass (defined in the file XI.h).

    The XXGGeettFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll request returns a pointer to a list of
    XFeedbackState structures. Each item in this list describes one of the
    feedbacks supported by the device. The items are variable length, so each
    contains its length to allow traversal to the next item in the list.

    The feedback classes that are currently defined are: KbdFeedbackClass,
    PtrFeedbackClass, StringFeedbackClass, IntegerFeedbackClass,
    LedFeedbackClass, and BellFeedbackClass. These constants are defined in
    the file XI.h. An input device may support zero or more classes of
    feedback, and may support multiple feedbacks of the same class. Each
    feedback contains a class identifier and an id that is unique within that
    class for that input device. The id is used to identify the feedback when
    making an XXCChhaannggeeFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll request.

    XXGGeettFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll can generate a BadDevice or BadMatch error.

    The XXCChhaannggeeFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll request modifies the values of one feedback on
    the specified device. The feedback is identified by the id field of the
    XFeedbackControl structure that is passed with the request. The fields of
    the feedback that are to be modified are identified by the bits of the
    mask that is passed with the request.

    XXCChhaannggeeFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll can generate a BadDevice, BadMatch, or BadValue
    error.

    Each class of feedback is described by a structure specific to that class.
    These structures are defined in the file XInput.h. XFeedbackState and

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist
        or has not been opened by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error
        may also occur if some other client has caused the specified device to
        become the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
        XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee or XXCChhaannggeePPooiinntteerrDDeevviiccee requests.

    BadMatch
        This error may occur if an XXGGeettFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll request was made
        specifying a device that has no feedbacks, or an
        XXCChhaannggeeFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll request was made with an XFeedbackControl
        structure that contains an invalid feedback type. It may also occur if
        an invalid combination of mask bits is specified (DvKey but no
        DvAutoRepeatMode for keyboard feedbacks), or if an invalid KeySym is
        specified for a string feedback.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        XXCChhaannggeeFFeeeeddbbaacckkCCoonnttrrooll request. Unless a specific range is specified
        for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is
        accepted. Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate
        this error.
