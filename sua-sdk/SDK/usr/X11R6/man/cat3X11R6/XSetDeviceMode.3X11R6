    The XXSSeettDDeevviicceeMMooddee request changes the mode of an input device that is
    capable of reporting either absolute positional information or relative
    motion information. Not all input devices are capable of reporting motion
    data, and not all are capable of changing modes from Absolute to Relative.

    XXSSeettDDeevviicceeMMooddee can generate a BadDevice or BadMode error.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist
        or has not been opened by this client via XOpenInputDevice. This error
        may also occur if some other client has caused the specified device to
        become the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
        XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee or XXCChhaannggeePPooiinntteerrDDeevviiccee requests.

    BadMatch
        This error may occur if an XXSSeettDDeevviicceeMMooddee request is made specifying a
        device that has no valuators and reports no axes of motion.

    BadMode
        An invalid mode was specified. This error will also be returned if the
        specified device is not capable of supporting the XXSSeettDDeevviicceeMMooddee
        request.
