    descendant
        Specifies either the widget in the subtree structure which is to
        receive the keyboard event, or None. Note that it is not an error to
        specify None when no input focus was previously set.

    w
        Specifies the widget for which the keyboard focus is to be set.

    If a future KeyPress or KeyRelease event occurs within the specified
    subtree, XXttSSeettKKeeyybbooaarrddFFooccuuss causes XXttDDiissppaattcchhEEvveenntt to remap and send the
    event to the specified descendant widget.

    When there is no modal cascade, keyboard events can occur within a widget
    W in one of three ways:
    *     W has the X input focus.
    *     W has the keyboard focus of one of its ancestors, and the event
          occurs within the ancestor or one of the ancestor's descendants.
    *     No ancestor of W has a descendant within the keyboard focus, and the
          pointer is within W.

    When there is a modal cascade, a widget W receives keyboard events if an
    ancestor of W is in the active subset of the modal cascade and one or more
    of the previous conditions is True.

    When subtree or one of its descendants acquires the X input focus or the
    pointer moves into the subtree such that keyboard events would now be
    delivered to subtree, a FocusIn event is generated for the descendant if
    FocusNotify events have been selected by the descendant. Similarly, when W
    loses the X input focus or the keyboard focus for one of its ancestors, a
    FocusOut event is generated for descendant if FocusNotify events have been
    selected by the descendant.
