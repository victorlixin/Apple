    border_width_return
        Returns the border width in pixels.

    d
        Specifies the drawable, which can be a window or a pixmap.

    depth_return
        Returns the depth of the drawable (bits per pixel for the object).

    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    root_return
        Returns the root window.

    w
        Specifies the window whose current attributes you want to obtain.
    width_return
    height_return
        Return the drawable's dimensions (width and height).

    window_attributes_return
        Returns the specified window's attributes in the XXWWiinnddoowwAAttttrriibbuutteess
        structure.
    x_return
    y_return
        Return the x and y coordinates that define the location of the
        drawable. For a window, these coordinates specify the upper-left outer
        corner relative to its parent's origin. For pixmaps, these coordinates
        are always zero.

    The XXGGeettWWiinnddoowwAAttttrriibbuutteess function returns the current attributes for the
    specified window to an XXWWiinnddoowwAAttttrriibbuutteess structure.

    XXGGeettWWiinnddoowwAAttttrriibbuutteess can generate BadDrawable and BadWindow errors.

    The XXGGeettGGeeoommeettrryy function returns the root window and the current geometry
    of the drawable. The geometry of the drawable includes the x and y
    coordinates, width and height, border width, and depth. These are
    described in the argument list. It is legal to pass to this function a
    window whose class is InputOnly.

    The XXWWiinnddoowwAAttttrriibbuutteess structure contains:

    typedef struct {
         int x, y;                /* location of window */
         int width, height;       /* width and height of window */
         int border_width;        /* border width of window */
         int depth;               /* depth of window */
         Visual *visual;          /* the associated visual structure */
         Window root;             /* root of screen containing window */
         int class;               /* InputOutput, InputOnly*/
         int bit_gravity;         /* one of the bit gravity values */
         int win_gravity;         /* one of the window gravity values */
         int backing_store;       /* NotUseful, WhenMapped, Always */
         unsigned long backing_planes;/* planes to be preserved if possible */
         unsigned long backing_pixel;/* value to be used when restoring planes
    */
         Bool save_under;         /* boolean, should bits under be saved? */
         Colormap colormap;       /* color map to be associated with window */
         Bool map_installed;      /* boolean, is color map currently
    installed*/
         int map_state;           /* IsUnmapped, IsUnviewable, IsViewable */
         long all_event_masks;    /* set of events all people have interest
    in*/
         long your_event_mask;    /* my event mask */
         long do_not_propagate_mask;/* set of events that should not propagate
    */
         Bool override_redirect;  /* boolean value for override-redirect */
         Screen *screen;          /* back pointer to correct screen */
    } XWindowAttributes;

    The x and y members are set to the upper-left outer corner relative to the
    parent window's origin. The width and height members are set to the inside
    size of the window, not including the border. The border_width member is
    set to the window's border width in pixels. The depth member is set to the
    depth of the window (that is, bits per pixel for the object). The visual
    member is a pointer to the screen's associated Visual structure. The root
    member is set to the root window of the screen containing the window. The
    class member is set to the window's class and can be either InputOutput or
    InputOnly.

    The bit_gravity member is set to the window's bit gravity and can be one
    of the following:

    ForgetGravity        EastGravity

    NorthWestGravity     SouthWestGravity

    NorthGravity         SouthGravity

    NorthEastGravity     SouthEastGravity

    WestGravity          StaticGravity

    The win_gravity member is set to the window's window gravity and can be
    one of the following:

    UnmapGravity         EastGravity

    NorthWestGravity     SouthWestGravity

    NorthGravity         SouthGravity

    NorthEastGravity     SouthEastGravity

    WestGravity          StaticGravity

    For additional information on gravity, see section 3.3.

    The backing_store member is set to indicate how the X server should
    maintain the contents of a window and can be WhenMapped, Always, or
    NotUseful. The backing_planes member is set to indicate (with bits set to
    1) which bit planes of the window hold dynamic data that must be preserved
    in backing_stores and during save_unders. The backing_pixel member is set
    to indicate what values to use for planes not set in backing_planes.

    The save_under member is set to True or False. The colormap member is set
    to the colormap for the specified window and can be a colormap ID or None.
    The map_installed member is set to indicate whether the colormap is
    currently installed and can be True or False. The map_state member is set
    to indicate the state of the window and can be IsUnmapped, IsUnviewable,
    or IsViewable. IsUnviewable is used if the window is mapped but some
    ancestor is unmapped.

    The all_event_masks member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of all event
    masks selected on the window by all clients. The your_event_mask member is
    set to the bitwise inclusive OR of all event masks selected by the
    querying client. The do_not_propagate_mask member is set to the bitwise
    inclusive OR of the set of events that should not propagate.

    The override_redirect member is set to indicate whether this window
    overrides structure control facilities and can be True or False. Window
    manager clients should ignore the window if this member is True.

    The screen member is set to a screen pointer that gives you a back pointer
    to the correct screen. This makes it easier to obtain the screen
    information without having to loop over the root window fields to see
    which field matches.

    BadDrawable
        A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or
        Pixmap.

    BadWindow
        A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
