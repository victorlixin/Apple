    The XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee request causes the server to use the specified
    device as the X keyboard. The device must have been previously opened by
    the requesting client via XXOOppeennDDeevviiccee or a BadDevice error will result.
    The device must support input class Keys, or a BadMatch error will result.
    If the server implementation does not support using the requested device
    as the X keyboard, a BadDevice error will result.

    If the specified device is grabbed by another client, AlreadyGrabbed is
    returned. If the specified device is frozen by a grab on another device,
    GrabFrozen is returned. If the request is successful, Success is returned.

    If the request succeeds, a ChangeDeviceNotify event is sent to all clients
    that have selected that event. A MappingNotify event with request =
    MappingKeyboard is sent to all clients. The specified device becomes the X
    keyboard and the old X keyboard becomes accessible through the input
    extension protocol requests.

    XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee can generate a BadDevice or a BadMatch error.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist,
        has not been opened by this client via XOpenInputDevice, or is already
        one of the core X device (pointer or keyboard). This error may also
        occur if the server implementation does not support using the
        specified device as the X keyboard.

    BadMatch
        This error may occur if an XXCChhaannggeeKKeeyybbooaarrddDDeevviiccee request was made
        specifying a device that has no keys.
