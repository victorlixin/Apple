    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    exposures
        Specifies a Boolean value that indicates if Expose events are to be
        generated.

    w
        Specifies the window.
    width
    height
        Specify the width and height, which are the dimensions of the
        rectangle.
    x
    y
        Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the origin of
        the window and specify the upper-left corner of the rectangle.

    The XXCClleeaarrAArreeaa function paints a rectangular area in the specified window
    according to the specified dimensions with the window's background pixel
    or pixmap. The subwindow-mode effectively is ClipByChildren. If width is
    zero, it is replaced with the current width of the window minus x. If
    height is zero, it is replaced with the current height of the window minus
    y. If the window has a defined background tile, the rectangle clipped by
    any children is filled with this tile. If the window has background None,
    the contents of the window are not changed. In either case, if exposures
    is True, one or more Expose events are generated for regions of the
    rectangle that are either visible or are being retained in a backing
    store. If you specify a window whose class is InputOnly, a BadMatch error
    results.

    XXCClleeaarrAArreeaa can generate BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

    The XXCClleeaarrWWiinnddooww function clears the entire area in the specified window
    and is equivalent to XXCClleeaarrAArreeaa (display, w, 0, 0, 0, 0, False). If the
    window has a defined background tile, the rectangle is tiled with a plane-
    mask of all ones and GXcopy function. If the window has background None,
    the contents of the window are not changed. If you specify a window whose
    class is InputOnly, a BadMatch error results.

    XXCClleeaarrWWiinnddooww can generate BadMatch and BadWindow errors.

    BadMatch
        An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    BadWindow
        A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
