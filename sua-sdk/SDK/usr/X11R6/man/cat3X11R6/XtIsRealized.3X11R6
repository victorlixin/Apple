    If the widget is already realized, XXttRReeaalliizzeeWWiiddggeett simply returns.
    Otherwise, it performs the following:

    *     Binds all action names in the widget's translation table to
          procedures (see Section 10.1.2).
    *     Makes a post-order traversal of the widget tree rooted at the
          specified widget and calls the change_managed procedure of each
          composite widget that has one or more managed children.
    *     Constructs an XXSSeettWWiinnddoowwAAttttrriibbuutteess structure filled in with
          information derived from the Core widget fields and calls the
          realize procedure for the widget, which adds any widget-specific
          attributes and creates the X window.
    *     If the widget is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass,
          XXttRReeaalliizzeeWWiiddggeett returns; otherwise, it continues and performs the
          following:
          *     Descends recursively to each of the widget's managed children and
                calls the realize procedures. Primitive widgets that instantiate
                children are responsible for realizing those children themselves.
          *     Maps all of the managed children windows that have
                mapped_when_managed True. (If a widget is managed but
                mapped_when_managed is False, the widget is allocated visual space
                but is not displayed. Some people seem to like this to indicate
                certain states.)

    If the widget is a top-level shell widget (that is, it has no parent), and
    mapped_when_managed is True, XXttRReeaalliizzeeWWiiddggeett maps the widget window.

    The XXttIIssRReeaalliizzeedd function returns True if the widget has been realized,
    that is, if the widget has a nonzero X window ID.

    Some widget procedures (for example, set_values) might wish to operate
    differently after the widget has been realized.

    The XXttUUnnrreeaalliizzeeWWiiddggeett function destroys the windows of an existing widget
    and all of its children (recursively down the widget tree). To recreate
    the windows at a later time, call XXttRReeaalliizzeeWWiiddggeett again. If the widget was
    managed, it will be unmanaged automatically before its window is freed.
