    XVisibilityNotifyEvent - VisibilityNotify event structure

  SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS

    The structure for VisibilityNotify events contains:

    typedef struct {
         int type;                /* VisibiltyNotify */
         unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
         Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent
    request */
         Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
         Window window;
         int state;
    } XVisibilityEvent;

    When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

    The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
    identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
    event to a client application, it sends an XXGGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoosseeEEvveenntt structure
    with the type member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
    pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set
    to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request. The serial
    member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded
    from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
    member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

    The window member is set to the window whose visibility state changes. The
    state member is set to the state of the window's visibility and can be
    VisibilityUnobscured, VisibilityPartiallyObscured, or
    VisibilityFullyObscured. The X server ignores all of a window's subwindows
    when determining the visibility state of the window and processes
    VisibilityNotify events according to the following:
    *     When the window changes state from partially obscured, fully
          obscured, or not viewable to viewable and completely unobscured, the
          X server generates the event with the state member of the
          XVisibilityEvent structure set to VisibilityUnobscured.
    *     When the window changes state from viewable and completely
          unobscured or not viewable to viewable and partially obscured, the X
          server generates the event with the state member of the
          XVisibilityEvent structure set to VisibilityPartiallyObscured.
    *     When the window changes state from viewable and completely
          unobscured, viewable and partially obscured, or not viewable to
          viewable and fully obscured, the X server generates the event with
          the state member of the XVisibilityEvent structure set to
          VisibilityFullyObscured.
