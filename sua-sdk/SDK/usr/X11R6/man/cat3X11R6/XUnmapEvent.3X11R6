    XUnmapEvent - UnmapNotify event structure

  SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS

    The structure for UnmapNotify events contains:

    typedef struct {
         int type;                /* UnmapNotify */
         unsigned long serial;    /* # of last request processed by server */
         Bool send_event;         /* true if this came from a SendEvent
    request */
         Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
         Window event;
         Window window;
         Bool from_configure;
    } XUnmapEvent;

    When you receive this event, the structure members are set as follows.

    The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
    identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
    event to a client application, it sends an XXGGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoosseeEEvveenntt structure
    with the type member set to GraphicsExpose. The display member is set to a
    pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set
    to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request. The serial
    member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded
    from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
    member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

    The event member is set either to the unmapped window or to its parent,
    depending on whether StructureNotify or SubstructureNotify was selected.
    This is the window used by the X server to report the event. The window
    member is set to the window that was unmapped. The from_configure member
    is set to True if the event was generated as a result of a resizing of the
    window's parent when the window itself had a win_gravity of UnmapGravity.
