    XAnyEvent, XEvent - generic X event structures

  SSTTRRUUCCTTUURREESS

    All the event structures declared in <<XX1111//XXlliibb..hh>> have the following
    common members:

    The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
    identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a GraphicsExpose
    event to a client application, it sends an XXGGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoosseeEEvveenntt structure
    with the type member set to GGrraapphhiiccssEExxppoossee. The display member is set to a
    pointer to the display the event was read on. The send_event member is set
    to True if the event came from a SendEvent protocol request. The serial
    member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but expanded
    from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value. The window
    member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit dispatchers.

    The XXEEvveenntt structure is a union of the individual structures declared for
    each event type:

    typedef union _XEvent { int type; must not be changed XAnyEvent xany;
    XKeyEvent xkey; XButtonEvent xbutton; XMotionEvent xmotion; XCrossingEvent
    xcrossing; XFocusChangeEvent xfocus; XExposeEvent xexpose;
    XGraphicsExposeEvent xgraphicsexpose; XNoExposeEvent xnoexpose;
    XVisibilityEvent xvisibility; XCreateWindowEvent xcreatewindow;
    XDestroyWindowEvent xdestroywindow; XUnmapEvent xunmap; XMapEvent xmap;
    XMapRequestEvent xmaprequest; XReparentEvent xreparent; XConfigureEvent
    xconfigure; XGravityEvent xgravity; XResizeRequestEvent xresizerequest;
    XConfigureRequestEvent xconfigurerequest; XCirculateEvent xcirculate;

    XSelectionClearEvent xselectionclear; XSelectionRequestEvent

    XClientMessageEvent xclient; XMappingEvent xmapping; XErrorEvent xerror;
    XKeymapEvent xkeymap; long pad[24]; } XEvent;
