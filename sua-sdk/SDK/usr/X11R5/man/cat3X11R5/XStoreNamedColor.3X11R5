    color
        Specifies the pixel and RGB values or the color name string (for
        example, red).

    color
        Specifies an array of color definition structures to be stored.

    colormap
        Specifies the colormap.

    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    flags
        Specifies which red, green, and blue components are set.

    ncolors
        Specifies the number of XXCCoolloorr structures in the color definition
        array.

    pixel
        Specifies the entry in the colormap.

    pixel values specified in the pixel members of the XXCCoolloorr structures. You
    specify which color components are to be changed by setting DoRed,
    DoGreen, and/or DoBlue in the flags member of the XXCCoolloorr structures. If
    the colormap is an installed map for its screen, the changes are visible

    allocated writable in the colormap by any client, even if one or more
    pixels generates an error. If a specified pixel is not a valid index into
    the colormap, a BadValue error results. If a specified pixel either is
    unallocated or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess error results. If more
    than one pixel is in error, the one that gets reported is arbitrary.

    value specified in the pixel member of the XXCCoolloorr structure. You specified
    this value in the pixel member of the XXCCoolloorr structure. This pixel value
    must be a read/write cell and a valid index into the colormap. If a
    specified pixel is not a valid index into the colormap, a BadValue error
    results. _XX_SS_tt_oo_rr_ee_CC_oo_ll_oo_rr(3X11R5) also changes the red, green, and/or blue

    respect to the screen associated with the colormap and stores the result
    in the specified colormap. The pixel argument determines the entry in the
    colormap. The flags argument determines which of the red, green, and blue
    components are set. You can set this member to the bitwise inclusive OR of
    the bits DoRed, DoGreen, and DoBlue. If the color name is not in the Host
    Portable Character Encoding the result is implementation dependent. Use of
    uppercase or lowercase does not matter. If the specified pixel is not a
    valid index into the colormap, a BadValue error results. If the specified
    pixel either is unallocated or is allocated read-only, a BadAccess error
    results.

    BadAccess
        A client attempted to free a color map entry that it did not already
        allocate.

    BadAccess
        A client attempted to store into a read-only color map entry.

    BadColor
        A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Colormap.

    BadName
        A font or color of the specified name does not exist.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
