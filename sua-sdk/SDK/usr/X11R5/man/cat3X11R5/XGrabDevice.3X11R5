    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    device
        Specifies the device to be grabbed or released.

    grab_window
        Specifies the id of a window to be associated with the device.

    owner_events
        Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the events from the
        device are to be reported as usual or reported with respect to the
        grab window if selected by the event list.

    event_count
        Specifies the number of elements in the event_list array.

    event_list
        Specifies a pointer to a list of event classes that indicates which
        events the client wishes to receive. These event classes must have
        been obtained specifying the device being grabbed.

    this_device_mode
        Specifies further processing of events from this device. You can pass
        GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

    other_devices_mode
        Specifies further processing of events from other devices. You can
        pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

    time
        Specifies the time. You can pass either a timestamp or CurrentTime.

    generates DeviceFocusIn and DeviceFocusOut events. Further device events
    are reported only to the grabbing client. _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee(3X11R5) overrides
    any active device grab by this client. event_list is a pointer to a list
    of event classes. This list indicates which events the client wishes to
    receive while the grab is active. If owner_events is False , all generated
    device events are reported with respect to grab_window if selected. If
    owner_events is True and if a generated device event would normally be
    reported to this client, it is reported normally; otherwise, the event is
    reported with respect to the grab_window, and is only reported if
    specified in the event_list.

    If the this_device_mode argument is GrabModeAsync , device event
    processing continues as usual. If the device is currently frozen by this
    client, then processing of device events is resumed. If the
    this_device_mode argument is GrabModeSync , the state of the device (as
    seen by client applications) appears to freeze, and the X server generates
    no further device events until the grabbing client issues a releasing

    Actual device changes are not lost while the device is frozen; they are
    simply queued in the server for later processing.

    If other_devices_mode is GrabModeAsync , processing of events from other
    devices is unaffected by activation of the grab. If other_devices_mode is
    GrabModeSync, the state of all devices except the grabbed device (as seen
    by client applications) appears to freeze, and the X server generates no
    further events from those devices until the grabbing client issues a
    releasing _XX_AA_ll_ll_oo_ww_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss(3X11R5) call or until the device grab is
    released. Actual events are not lost while the devices are frozen; they
    are simply queued in the server for later processing.

    If the device is actively grabbed by some other client,

    not viewable, it fails and returns GrabNotViewable. If the device is
    frozen by an active grab of another client, it fails and returns
    GrabFrozen. If the specified time is earlier than the last-device-grab
    time or later than the current X server time, it fails and returns
    GrabInvalidTime. Otherwise, the last-device-grab time is set to the
    specified time (CurrentTime is replaced by the current X server time).

    If a grabbed device is closed by a client while an active grab by that
    client is in effect, the active grab is released. If the device is frozen
    only by an active grab of the requesting client, it is thawed.

    not release the device and any queued events if the specified time is
    earlier than the last-device-grab time or is later than the current X
    server time. It also generates DeviceFocusIn and DeviceFocusOut events.
    The X server automatically performs an UUnnggrraabbDDeevviiccee() request if the event
    window for an active device grab becomes not viewable.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist
        or has not been opened by this client with XXOOppeennIInnppuuttDDeevviiccee(). This
        error may also occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X
        pointer device.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    BadWindow
        A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
