    If the widget is already realized, _XX_tt_RR_ee_aa_ll_ii_zz_ee_WW_ii_dd_gg_ee_tt(3X11R5) simply returns.
    Otherwise, it performs the following:
    *     Binds all action names in the widget's translation table to
          procedures (see Section 10.1.2).
    *     Makes a post-order traversal of the widget tree rooted at the
          specified widget and calls the change_managed procedure of each
          composite widget that has one or more managed children.
    *     Constructs an XXSSeettWWiinnddoowwAAttttrriibbuutteess structure filled in with
          information derived from the Core widget fields and calls the
          realize procedure for the widget, which adds any widget-specific
          attributes and creates the X window.
    *     If the widget is not a subclass of compositeWidgetClass,
          _XX_tt_RR_ee_aa_ll_ii_zz_ee_WW_ii_dd_gg_ee_tt(3X11R5) returns; otherwise, it continues and
          performs the following:
          *     Descends recursively to each of the widget's managed children
                and calls the realize procedures. Primitive widgets that
                instantiate children are responsible for realizing those
                children themselves.
          *     Maps all of the managed children windows that have
                mapped_when_managed True. (If a widget is managed but
                mapped_when_managed is False, the widget is allocated visual
                space but is not displayed. Some people seem to like this to
                indicate certain states.)

    If the widget is a top-level shell widget (that is, it has no parent), and
    mapped_when_managed is True, _XX_tt_RR_ee_aa_ll_ii_zz_ee_WW_ii_dd_gg_ee_tt(3X11R5) maps the widget
    window.

    The _XX_tt_II_ss_RR_ee_aa_ll_ii_zz_ee_dd(3X11R5) function returns True if the widget has been
    realized, that is, if the widget has a nonzero X window ID.

    Some widget procedures (for example, set_values) might tend to operate
    differently after the widget has been realized.

    The _XX_tt_UU_nn_rr_ee_aa_ll_ii_zz_ee_WW_ii_dd_gg_ee_tt(3X11R5) function destroys the windows of an existing
    widget and all of its children (recursively down the widget tree). To
    recreate the windows at a later time, call _XX_tt_RR_ee_aa_ll_ii_zz_ee_WW_ii_dd_gg_ee_tt(3X11R5) again.
    If the widget was managed, it will be unmanaged automatically before its
    window is freed.
