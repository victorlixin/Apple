    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    device
        Specifies the device that is to be grabbed or released

    Key
        Specifies the device Key that is to be grabbed or released or AnyKey.

    modifiers
        Specifies the set of keymasks or AnyModifier. The mask is the bitwise
        inclusive OR of the valid keymask bits. Valid bits are: ShiftMask,
        LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask,
        Mod5Mask.

    modifier_device
        Specifies the device whose modifiers are to be used. If a
        modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard will be used as
        the modifier_device.

    grab_window
        Specifies the grab window.

    owner_events
        Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the device events are
        to be reported as usual or reported with respect to the grab window if
        selected by the event list.

    event_count
        Specifies the number of event classes in the event list.

    event_list
        Specifies which device events are reported to the client.

    this_device_mode
        Specifies further processing of events from this device. You can pass
        GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

    other_devices_mode
        Specifies further processing of events from other devices. You can
        pass GrabModeSync or GrabModeAsync.

    The _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) request establishes a passive grab. In the
    future, the device is actively grabbed (as for _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee(3X11R5), the
    last-device-grab time is set to the time at which the Key was pressed (as
    transmitted in the DeviceKeyPress event), and the DeviceKeyPress event is
    reported if all of the following conditions are true:
    *     The device is not grabbed, and the specified key is logically
          pressed when the specified modifier keys are logically down, and no
          other keys or modifier keys are logically down.
    *     The grab_window is an ancestor (or is) the focus window OR the grab
          window is a descendant of the focus window and contains the device.
    *     The confine_to window (if any) is viewable.
    *     A passive grab on the same key/modifier combination does not exist
          on any ancestor of grab_window.

    The interpretation of the remaining arguments is as for
    _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee(3X11R5). The active grab is terminated automatically when the
    logical state of the device has the specified key released.

    Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by means of the X
    protocol ) might lag the physical state if device event processing is
    frozen.

    If the key is not AnyKey, it must be in the range specified by min_keycode
    and max_keycode as returned by the _XX_LL_ii_ss_tt_II_nn_pp_uu_tt_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_ss(3X11R5) request.
    Otherwise, a BadValue error results.

    This request overrides all previous grabs by the same client on the same
    Key/modifier combinations on the same window. A modifier of AnyModifier is
    equivalent to issuing the grab request for all possible modifier
    combinations (including the combination of no modifiers). It is not
    required that all modifiers specified have currently assigned KeyCodes. A
    key of AnyKey is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible keys.
    Otherwise, it is not required that the specified key currently be assigned
    to a physical Key.

    If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard will be used as
    the modifier_device.

    If some other client has already issued a _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) with the
    same Key/modifier combination on the same window, a BadAccess error
    results. When using AnyModifier or AnyKey , the request fails completely,
    and a BadAccess error results (no grabs are established) if there is a
    conflicting grab for any combination. _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) has no effect
    on an active grab.

    _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) can generate BadAccess, BadClass, BadDevice,
    BadMatch, BadValue, and BadWindow errors. It returns Success on successful
    completion of the request.

    The _XX_UU_nn_gg_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) request releases the passive grab for a key/
    modifier combination on the specified window if it was grabbed by this
    client. A modifier of AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the ungrab
    request for all possible modifier combinations, including the combination
    of no modifiers. A Key of AnyKey is equivalent to issuing the request for
    all possible Keys. _XX_UU_nn_gg_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) has no effect on an active
    grab.

    If a modifier_device of NULL is specified, the X keyboard will be used as
    the modifier_device.

    _XX_UU_nn_gg_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) can generate BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue and
    BadWindow errors.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist
        or has not been opened by this client with XXOOppeennIInnppuuttDDeevviiccee(). This
        error might also occur if the specified device is the X keyboard or X
        pointer device.

    BadMatch
        This error might occur if an _XX_GG_rr_aa_bb_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee_KK_ee_yy(3X11R5) request was made
        specifying a device that has no keys, or a modifier device that has no
        keys.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    BadWindow
        A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
