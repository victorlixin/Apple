    convert_proc
        Specifies the procedure that is to be called whenever someone requests
        the current value of the selection.

    done_proc
        Specifies the procedure that is called after the requestor has
        received the selection or NULL if the owner is not interested in being
        called back.

    lose_selection
        Specifies the procedure that is to be called whenever the widget has
        lost selection ownership or NULL if the owner is not interested in
        being called back.

    selection
        Specifies an atom that describes the type of the selection (for
        example, XA_PRIMARY, XA_SECONDARY, or XA_CLIPBOARD).

    time
        Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the selection ownership
        should commence or is to be relinquished.

    w
        Specifies the widget that wishes to become the owner or to relinquish
        ownership.

    mechanism that a widget believes it owns a selection. It returns True if
    the widget has successfully become the owner and False otherwise. The
    widget might fail to become the owner if some other widget has asserted
    ownership at a time later than this widget. Note that widgets can lose
    selection ownership either because someone else asserted later ownership
    of the selection or because the widget voluntarily gave up ownership of
    the selection. Also note that the lose_selection procedure is not called
    if the widget fails to obtain selection ownership in the first place.

    mechanism that the specified widget is to lose ownership of the selection.
    If the widget does not currently own the selection either because it lost
    the selection or because it never had the selection to begin with,

    is not called even if a request arrives later with a timestamp during the
    period that this widget owned the selection. However, its done procedure
    will be called if a conversion that started before the call to
    _XX_tt_DD_ii_ss_oo_ww_nn_SS_ee_ll_ee_cc_tt_ii_oo_nn(3X11R5) finishes after the call to
