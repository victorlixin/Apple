    The _XX_PP_uu_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) function combines an image in memory with a
    rectangle of the specified drawable. If XYBitmap format is used, the depth
    of the image must be one, or a BadMatch error results. The foreground
    pixel in the GC defines the source for the one bits in the image, and the
    background pixel defines the source for the zero bits. For XYPixmap and
    ZPixmap, the depth of the image must match the depth of the drawable, or a
    BadMatch error results. The section of the image defined by the src_x,
    src_y, width, and height arguments is drawn on the specified part of the
    drawable.

    This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, subwindow-
    mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. It also uses these GC
    mode-dependent components: foreground and background.

    _XX_PP_uu_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) cangenerate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and BadValue
    errors.

    The _XX_GG_ee_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) function returns a pointer to an XXIImmaaggee structure.
    This structure provides you with the contents of the specified rectangle
    of the drawable in the format you specify. If the format argument is
    XYPixmap, the image contains only the bit planes you passed to the
    plane_mask argument. If the plane_mask argument only requests a subset of
    the planes of the display, the depth of the returned image will be the
    number of planes requested. If the format argument is ZPixmap,
    _XX_GG_ee_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) returns as zero the bits in all planes not specified in
    the plane_mask argument. The function performs no range checking on the
    values in plane_mask and ignores extraneous bits.

    _XX_GG_ee_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) returns the depth of the image to the depth member of
    the XXIImmaaggee structure. The depth of the image is as specified when the
    drawable was created, except when getting a subset of the planes in
    XYPixmap format, when the depth is given by the number of bits set to 1 in
    plane_mask.

    If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be wholly contained
    within the pixmap, or a BadMatch error results. If the drawable is a
    window, the window must be viewable, and it must be the case that if there
    were no inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified rectangle of the
    window would be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained within
    the outside edges of the window, or a BadMatch error results. Note that
    the borders of the window can be included and read with this request. If
    the window has backing-store, the backing-store contents are returned for
    regions of the window that are obscured by noninferior windows. If the
    window does not have backing-store, the returned contents of such obscured
    regions are undefined. The returned contents of visible regions of
    inferiors of a different depth than the specified window's depth are also
    undefined. The pointer cursor image is not included in the returned
    contents. If a problem occurs, _XX_GG_ee_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) returns NULL.

    _XX_GG_ee_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) can generate BadDrawable, BadMatch, and BadValue errors.

    The _XX_GG_ee_tt_SS_uu_bb_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) function updates dest_image with the specified
    subimage in the same manner as _XX_GG_ee_tt_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5). If the format argument
    is XYPixmap, the image contains only the bit planes you passed to the
    plane_mask argument. If the format argument is ZPixmap,
    _XX_GG_ee_tt_SS_uu_bb_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) returns as zero the bits in all planes not specified
    in the plane_mask argument. The function performs no range checking on the
    values in plane_mask and ignores extraneous bits. As a convenience,
    _XX_GG_ee_tt_SS_uu_bb_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) returns a pointer to the same XXIImmaaggee structure
    specified by dest_image.

    The depth of the destination XXIImmaaggee structure must be the same as that of
    the drawable. If the specified subimage does not fit at the specified
    location on the destination image, the right and bottom edges are clipped.
    If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be wholly contained
    within the pixmap, or a BadMatch error results. If the drawable is a
    window, the window must be viewable, and it must be the case that if there
    were no inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified rectangle of the
    window would be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained within
    the outside edges of the window, or a BadMatch error results. If the
    window has backing-store, then the backing-store contents are returned for
    regions of the window that are obscured by noninferior windows. If the
    window does not have backing-store, the returned contents of such obscured
    regions are undefined. The returned contents of visible regions of
    inferiors of a different depth than the specified window's depth are also
    undefined. If a problem occurs, _XX_GG_ee_tt_SS_uu_bb_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) returns NULL.

    _XX_GG_ee_tt_SS_uu_bb_II_mm_aa_gg_ee(3X11R5) can generate BadDrawable, BadGC, BadMatch, and
    BadValue errors.

    BadDrawable
        A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or
        Pixmap.

    BadGC
        A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.

    BadMatch
        An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

    BadMatch
        Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but
        fails to match in some other way required by the request.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
