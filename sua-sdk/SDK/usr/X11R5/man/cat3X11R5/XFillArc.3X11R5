    specified rectangle or rectangles as if a four-point FillPolygon protocol
    request were specified for each rectangle:

    [x,y] [x+width,y] [x+width,y+height] [x,y+height]

    Each function uses the x and y coordinates, width and height dimensions,
    and GC you specify.

    _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_RR_ee_cc_tt_aa_nn_gg_ll_ee_ss(3X11R5) fills the rectangles in the order listed in the
    array. For any given rectangle, _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_RR_ee_cc_tt_aa_nn_gg_ll_ee(3X11R5) and

    intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times.

    Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
    subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. They also use
    these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background, tile, stipple,
    tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

    _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_RR_ee_cc_tt_aa_nn_gg_ll_ee(3X11R5) and _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_RR_ee_cc_tt_aa_nn_gg_ll_ee_ss(3X11R5) can generate
    BadDrawable, BadGC, and BadMatch errors.

    XFillPolygon fills the region closed by the specified path. The path is
    closed automatically if the last point in the list does not coincide with
    the first point. XFillPolygon does not draw a pixel of the region more
    than once. CoordModeOrigin treats all coordinates as relative to the
    origin, and CoordModePrevious treats all coordinates after the first as
    relative to the previous point.

    Depending on the specified shape, the following occurs:
    *     If shape is Complex, the path may self-intersect. Note that
          contiguous coincident points in the path are not treated as self-
          intersection.
    *     If shape is Convex, for every pair of points inside the polygon, the
          line segment connecting them does not intersect the path. If known
          by the client, specifying Convex can improve performance. If you
          specify Convex for a path that is not convex, the graphics results
          are undefined.
    *     If shape is Nonconvex, the path does not self-intersect, but the
          shape is not wholly convex. If known by the client, specifying
          Nonconvex instead of Complex may improve performance. If you specify
          Nonconvex for a self-intersecting path, the graphics results are
          undefined.

    The fill-rule of the GC controls the filling behavior of self-intersecting
    polygons.

    This function uses these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
    fill-rule, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask. It
    also uses these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,
    tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

    BadValue errors.

    For each arc, _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_AA_rr_cc(3X11R5) or _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_AA_rr_cc_ss(3X11R5) fills the region
    closed by the infinitely thin path described by the specified arc and,
    depending on the arc-mode specified in the GC, one or two line segments.
    For ArcChord, the single line segment joining the endpoints of the arc is
    used. For ArcPieSlice, the two line segments joining the endpoints of the
    arc with the center point are used. XFillArcs fills the arcs in the order
    listed in the array. For any given arc, _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_AA_rr_cc(3X11R5) and
    _XX_FF_ii_ll_ll_AA_rr_cc_ss(3X11R5) do not draw a pixel more than once. If regions
    intersect, the intersecting pixels are drawn multiple times.

    Both functions use these GC components: function, plane-mask, fill-style,
    arc-mode, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
    They also use these GC mode-dependent components: foreground, background,
    tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, and tile-stipple-y-origin.

    and BadMatch errors.

    BadDrawable
        A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or
        Pixmap.

    BadGC
        A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.

    BadMatch
        An InputOnly window is used as a Drawable.

    BadMatch
        Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but
        fails to match in some other way required by the request.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
