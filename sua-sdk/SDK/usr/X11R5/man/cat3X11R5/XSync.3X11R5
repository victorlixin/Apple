    discard
        Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether _XX_SS_yy_nn_cc(3X11R5)
        discards all events on the event queue.

    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    mode
        Specifies the mode. You can pass QueuedAlready, QueuedAfterFlush, or
        QueuedAfterReading.

    The _XX_FF_ll_uu_ss_hh(3X11R5) function flushes the output buffer. Most client
    applications need not use this function because the output buffer is
    automatically flushed as needed by calls to _XX_PP_ee_nn_dd_ii_nn_gg(3X11R5),
    _XX_NN_ee_xx_tt_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt(3X11R5), and _XX_WW_ii_nn_dd_oo_ww_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt(3X11R5). Events generated by the
    server may be queued into the library's event queue.

    The _XX_SS_yy_nn_cc(3X11R5) function flushes the output buffer and then waits until
    all requests have been received and processed by the X server. Any errors
    generated must be handled by the error handler. For each protocol error
    received by Xlib, _XX_SS_yy_nn_cc(3X11R5) calls the client application's error
    handling routine (see section 11.8.2). Any events generated by the server
    are enqueued into the library's event queue.

    Finally, if you passed False, _XX_SS_yy_nn_cc(3X11R5) does not discard the events in
    the queue. If you passed True, _XX_SS_yy_nn_cc(3X11R5) discards all events in the
    queue, including those events that were on the queue before _XX_SS_yy_nn_cc(3X11R5)
    was called. Client applications seldom need to call _XX_SS_yy_nn_cc(3X11R5).

    If mode is QueuedAlready, _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) returns the number of
    events already in the event queue (and never performs a system call). If
    mode is QueuedAfterFlush, _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) returns the number of
    events already in the queue if the number is nonzero. If there are no
    events in the queue, _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) flushes the output buffer,
    attempts to read more events out of the application's connection, and
    returns the number read. If mode is QueuedAfterReading,
    _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) returns the number of events already in the queue if
    the number is nonzero. If there are no events in the queue,
    _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) attempts to read more events out of the
    application's connection without flushing the output buffer and returns
    the number read.

    _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) always returns immediately without I/O if there are
    events already in the queue. _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) with mode
    QueuedAfterFlush is identical in behavior to _XX_PP_ee_nn_dd_ii_nn_gg(3X11R5).
    _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) with mode QueuedAlready is identical to the
    XXQQLLeennggtthh() function.

    The _XX_PP_ee_nn_dd_ii_nn_gg(3X11R5) function returns the number of events that have been
    received from the X server but have not been removed from the event queue.
    _XX_PP_ee_nn_dd_ii_nn_gg(3X11R5) is identical to _XX_EE_vv_ee_nn_tt_ss_QQ_uu_ee_uu_ee_dd(3X11R5) with the mode
    QueuedAfterFlush specified.
