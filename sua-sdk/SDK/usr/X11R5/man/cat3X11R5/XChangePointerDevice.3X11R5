    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    device
        Specifies the device to be used as the X pointer.

    xaxis
        Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X pointer x-axis.

    yaxis
        Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X pointer y-axis.

    specified device as the X pointer. The device must have been opened by the
    client through _XX_OO_pp_ee_nn_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee(3X11R5) or a BadDevice error will result. The
    device must support input class Valuators or a BadMatch error will result.
    If the implementation does not support use of the specified device as the
    X pointer, a BadDevice error will result.

    If the specified device is grabbed by another client, AlreadyGrabbed is
    returned. If the specified device is frozen by a grab on another device,
    GrabFrozen is returned. If the request is successful, Success is returned.

    If the request succeeds, a ChangeDeviceNotify event is sent to all clients
    that have selected that event. A MappingNotify event with request =
    MappingPointer is sent to all clients. The specified device becomes the X
    pointer, and the old X pointer becomes accessible through the input
    extension protocol requests.

    BadDevice
        An invalid device was specified. The specified device does not exist,
        has not been opened by this client with XXOOppeennIInnppuuttDDeevviiccee(), or is
        already one of the core X input devices (pointer or keyboard). This
        error might also occur if the server implementation does not support
        using the specified device as the X pointer.

    BadMatch
        This error can occur if an _XX_CC_hh_aa_nn_gg_ee_PP_oo_ii_nn_tt_ee_rr_DD_ee_vv_ii_cc_ee(3X11R5) request was
        made specifying a device that has less than two valuators, or
        specifying a valuator index beyond the range supported by the device.
