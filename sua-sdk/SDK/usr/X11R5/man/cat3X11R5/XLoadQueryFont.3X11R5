    The _XX_LL_oo_aa_dd_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) function loads the specified font and returns its
    associated font ID. If the font name is not in the Host Portable Character
    Encoding the result is implementation dependent. Use of uppercase or
    lowercase does not matter. The interpretation of characters ``?'' and
    ``*'' in the name is not defined by the core protocol but is reserved for
    future definition. A structured format for font names is specified in the
    X Consortium standard X Logical Font Description Conventions. If
    _XX_LL_oo_aa_dd_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) was unsuccessful at loading the specified font, a
    BadName error results. Fonts are not associated with a particular screen
    and can be stored as a component of any GC. When the font is no longer
    needed, call _XX_UU_nn_ll_oo_aa_dd_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5).

    _XX_LL_oo_aa_dd_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) can generate BadAlloc and BadName errors.

    The _XX_QQ_uu_ee_rr_yy_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) function returns a pointer to the XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt
    structure, which contains information associated with the font. You can
    query a font or the font stored in a GC. The font ID stored in the
    XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt structure will be the GGCCoonntteexxtt ID, and you need to be careful
    when using this ID in other functions (see _XX_GG_CC_oo_nn_tt_ee_xx_tt_FF_rr_oo_mm_GG_CC(3X11R5)). If
    the font does not exist, _XX_QQ_uu_ee_rr_yy_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) returns NULL. To free this
    data, use _XX_FF_rr_ee_ee_FF_oo_nn_tt_II_nn_ff_oo(3X11R5).

    The _XX_LL_oo_aa_dd_QQ_uu_ee_rr_yy_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) function provides the most common way for
    accessing a font. _XX_LL_oo_aa_dd_QQ_uu_ee_rr_yy_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) both opens (loads) the specified
    font and returns a pointer to the appropriate XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt structure. If
    the font name is not in the Host Portable Character Encoding the result is
    implementation dependent. If the font does not exist,
    _XX_LL_oo_aa_dd_QQ_uu_ee_rr_yy_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) returns NULL.

    The _XX_FF_rr_ee_ee_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) function deletes the association between the font
    resource ID and the specified font and frees the XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt structure.
    The font itself will be freed when no other resource references it. The
    data and the font should not be referenced again.

    _XX_FF_rr_ee_ee_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) can generate a BadFont error.

    Given the atom for that property, the _XX_GG_ee_tt_FF_oo_nn_tt_PP_rr_oo_pp_ee_rr_tt_yy(3X11R5) function
    returns the value of the specified font property. _XX_GG_ee_tt_FF_oo_nn_tt_PP_rr_oo_pp_ee_rr_tt_yy(3X11R5)
    also returns False if the property was not defined or True if it was
    defined. A set of predefined atoms exists for font properties, which can
    be found in <<XX1111//XXaattoomm..hh>>. This set contains the standard properties
    associated with a font. Although it is not guaranteed, it is likely that
    the predefined font properties will be present.

    resource ID and the specified font. The font itself will be freed when no
    other resource references it. The font should not be referenced again.

    _XX_UU_nn_ll_oo_aa_dd_FF_oo_nn_tt(3X11R5) can generate a BadFont error.

    The XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt structure contains all of the information for the font and
    consists of the font-specific information as well as a pointer to an array
    of XXCChhaarrSSttrruucctt structures for the characters contained in the font. The
    XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt, XXFFoonnttPPrroopp, and XXCChhaarrSSttrruucctt structures contain:

         short rbearing;          origin to right edge of raster

         int ascent;              logical extent above baseline for spacing

    X supports single byte/character, two bytes/character matrix, and 16-bit
    character text operations. Note that any of these forms can be used with a
    font, but a single byte/character text request can only specify a single
    byte (that is, the first row of a 2-byte font). You should view 2-byte
    fonts as a two-dimensional matrix of defined characters: byte1 specifies
    the range of defined rows and byte2 defines the range of defined columns
    of the font. Single byte/character fonts have one row defined, and the
    byte2 range specified in the structure defines a range of characters.

    The bounding box of a character is defined by the XXCChhaarrSSttrruucctt of that
    character. When characters are absent from a font, the default_char is
    used. When fonts have all characters of the same size, only the
    information in the XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt min and max bounds are used.

    The members of the XXFFoonnttSSttrruucctt have the following semantics:
    *     The direction member can be either FontLeftToRight or
          FontRightToLeft. It is just a hint as to whether most XXCChhaarrSSttrruucctt
          elements have a positive (FontLeftToRight) or a negative
          (FontRightToLeft) character width metric. The core protocol defines
          no support for vertical text.
    *     If the min_byte1 and max_byte1 members are both zero,
          min_char_or_byte2 specifies the linear character index corresponding
          to the first element of the per_char array, and max_char_or_byte2
          specifies the linear character index of the last element.
    *     If either min_byte1 or max_byte1 are nonzero, both min_char_or_byte2
          and max_char_or_byte2 are less than 256, and the 2-byte character
          index values corresponding to the per_char array element N (counting
          from 0) are:
    *
          where:

          D
              = max_char_or_byte2 - min_char_or_byte2 + 1

          /
              = integer division

          \
              = integer modulus
    *     If the per_char pointer is NULL, all glyphs between the first and
          last character indexes inclusive have the same information, as given
          by both min_bounds and max_bounds.
    *     If all_chars_exist is True, all characters in the per_char array
          have nonzero bounding boxes.
    *     The default_char member specifies the character that will be used
          when an undefined or nonexistent character is printed. The
          default_char is a 16-bit character (not a 2-byte character). For a
          font using 2-byte matrix format, the default_char has byte1 in the
          most-significant byte and byte2 in the least-significant byte. If
          the default_char itself specifies an undefined or nonexistent
          character, no printing is performed for an undefined or nonexistent
          character.
    *     The min_bounds and max_bounds members contain the most extreme
          values of each individual XXCChhaarrSSttrruucctt component over all elements of
          this array (and ignore nonexistent characters). The bounding box of
          the font (the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape obtained by
          superimposing all of the characters at the same origin [x,y]) has
          its upper-left coordinate at:
          [x + min_bounds.lbearing, y - max_bounds.ascent]
    *
          Its width is:
          max_bounds.rbearing - min_bounds.lbearing
    *
          Its height is:
          max_bounds.ascent + max_bounds.descent
    *     The ascent member is the logical extent of the font above the
          baseline that is used for determining line spacing. Specific
          characters may extend beyond this.
    *     The descent member is the logical extent of the font at or below the
          baseline that is used for determining line spacing. Specific
          characters may extend beyond this.
    *     If the baseline is at Y-coordinate y, the logical extent of the font
          is inclusive between the Y-coordinate values (y - font.ascent) and
          (y + font.descent - 1). Typically, the minimum interline spacing
          between rows of text is given by ascent + descent.

    For a character origin at [x,y], the bounding box of a character (that is,
    the smallest rectangle that encloses the character's shape) described in
    terms of XXCChhaarrSSttrruucctt components is a rectangle with its upper-left corner
    at:

    [x + lbearing, y - ascent]

    Its width is:

    rbearing - lbearing

    Its height is:

    ascent + descent

    The origin for the next character is defined to be:

    [x + width, y]

    The lbearing member defines the extent of the left edge of the character
    ink from the origin. The rbearing member defines the extent of the right
    edge of the character ink from the origin. The ascent member defines the
    extent of the top edge of the character ink from the origin. The descent
    member defines the extent of the bottom edge of the character ink from the
    origin. The width member defines the logical width of the character.
