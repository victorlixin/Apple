    attributes
        Specifies the structure from which the values (as specified by the
        value mask) are to be taken. The value mask should have the
        appropriate bits set to indicate which attributes have been set in the
        structure.

    background
        Specifies the background pixel value of the window.

    border
        Specifies the border pixel value of the window.

    border_width
        Specifies the width of the created window's border in pixels.

    class
        Specifies the created window's class. You can pass InputOutput,
        InputOnly, or CopyFromParent. A class of CopyFromParent means the
        class is taken from the parent.

    depth
        Specifies the window's depth. A depth of CopyFromParent means the
        depth is taken from the parent.

    display
        Specifies the connection to the X server.

    parent
        Specifies the parent window.

    valuemask
        Specifies which window attributes are defined in the attributes
        argument. This mask is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid attribute
        mask bits. If valuemask is zero, the attributes are ignored and are
        not referenced.

    visual
        Specifies the visual type. A visual of CopyFromParent means the visual
        type is taken from the parent.

    width

    height
        Specify the width and height, which are the created window's inside
        dimensions and do not include the created window's borders.

    x

    y
        Specify the x and y coordinates, which are the top-left outside corner
        of the window's borders and are relative to the inside of the parent
        window's borders.

    The _XX_CC_rr_ee_aa_tt_ee_WW_ii_nn_dd_oo_ww(3X11R5) function creates an unmapped subwindow for a
    specified parent window, returns the window ID of the created window, and
    causes the X server to generate a CreateNotify event. The created window
    is placed on top in the stacking order with respect to siblings.

    The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Y axis vertical,
    with the origin [0, 0] at the upper left. Coordinates are integral, in
    terms of pixels, and coincide with pixel centers. Each window and pixmap
    has its own coordinate system. For a window, the origin is inside the
    border at the inside upper left.

    The border_width for an InputOnly window must be zero, or a BadMatch error
    results. For class InputOutput , the visual type and depth must be a
    combination supported for the screen, or a BadMatch error results. The
    depth need not be the same as the parent, but the parent must not be a
    window of class InputOnly , or a BadMatch error results. For an InputOnly
    window, the depth must be zero, and the visual must be one supported by
    the screen. If either condition is not met, a BadMatch error results. The
    parent window, however, may have any depth and class. If you specify any
    invalid window attribute for a window, a BadMatch error results.

    The created window is not yet displayed (mapped) on the user's display. To
    display the window, call XMapWindow . The new window initially uses the
    same cursor as its parent. A new cursor can be defined for the new window
    by calling XDefineCursor . The window will not be visible on the screen
    unless it and all of its ancestors are mapped and it is not obscured by
    any of its ancestors.

    subwindow for a specified parent window, returns the window ID of the
    created window, and causes the X server to generate a CreateNotify event.
    The created window is placed on top in the stacking order with respect to
    siblings. Any part of the window that extends outside its parent window is
    clipped. The border_width for an InputOnly window must be zero, or a
    BadMatch error results. XCreateSimpleWindow inherits its depth, class, and
    visual from its parent. All other window attributes, except background and
    border, have their default values.

    BadAlloc
        The server failed to allocate the requested resource or server memory.

    BadColor
        A value for a Colormap argument does not name a defined Colormap.

    BadCursor
        A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor.

    BadMatch
        The values do not exist for an InputOnly window.

    BadMatch
        Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but
        fails to match in some other way required by the request.

    BadPixmap
        A value for a Pixmap argument does not name a defined Pixmap.

    BadValue
        Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the
        request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the
        full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument
        defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

    BadWindow
        A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
