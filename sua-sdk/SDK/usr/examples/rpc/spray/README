    RPC spray version 1.0

    This is my implementation of the RPC spray service.  I hope it works
    as it is meant to work, but I can't guarantee this. All I had was
    the spray.x file and a few pages in Hal Stern's NIS book.  Please
    report any incompatibilities with other spray implementations to
    me.

    RPC spray is UDP-based, and is slightly better for measuring your
    network link's bandwidth than TCP-based tools like tcpspray (IMHO).
