    bind() - bind a name to a socket

    int bind (int s, const struct sockaddr *addr, int addrlen)

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The _bb_ii_nn_dd(2) function assigns an address addr to an unnamed socket s. When
    a socket is created with _ss_oo_cc_kk_ee_tt(2) it exists in a name space (address
    family) but has no name assigned. The _bb_ii_nn_dd(2) function requests that name
    be assigned to the socket.

    The arguments are:

    s
        The socket to be bound.

    addr
        A pointer to a socket address structure. TCP/IP and UDP supports and
        sockets.

    addrlen
        The length of the ssoocckkaaddddrr structure pointed to by addr.

    If the bind is successful, the function returns 0. If there is an error,
    the function returns -1, and sets errno to indicate the error.

    The _bb_ii_nn_dd(2) call will fail if:

    [EACCES]
        The requested address is protected, and the current user has
        inadequate permission to access it. This error cannot occur in the
        Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications implementation, because there are no privileged ports (that
        is, ports 0-1024 are not restricted).

    [EADDRNOTAVAIL]
        The specified address is not available from the local machine.

    [EADDRINUSE]
        The specified address is already in use.

    [EBADF]
        The value of s is not a valid descriptor.

    [EFAULT]
        The addr parameter is not in a valid part of the user address space.

    [EINVAL]
        The socket is already bound to an address, or the call was applied
        against a device that doesn't support sockets.

    [ENOTSOCK]
        The value of s is not a socket.

    The following errors are specific to sockets using the AF_LOCAL protocol
    family (previously known as AF_UNIX), and therefore will not appear on
    Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications:

    [ENOTDIR]
        A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

    [EINVAL]
        The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set.

    [EIO]
        An I/O error occurred while making the directory entry or allocating
        the file serial number.

    [EISDIR]
        An empty pathname was specified.

    [ELOOP]
        Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

    [ENAMETOOLONG]
        A component of a pathname exceeded {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire
        path name exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.

    [ENOENT]
        A prefix component of the path name does not exist.

    [EROFS]
        The name would reside on a read-only file system.
