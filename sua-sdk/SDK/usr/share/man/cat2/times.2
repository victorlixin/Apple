    clock_t times (struct tms *tp)

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The _tt_ii_mm_ee_ss(2) function returns the value of time in CLK_TCK's of a second
    since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated
    Universal Time.

    It also fills in the structure pointed to by tp with time-accounting
    information.

    The tms structure is defined as follows:

    typedef struct {
         clock_t tms_utime;
         clock_t tms_stime;
         clock_t tms_cutime;
         clock_t tms_cstime;
    }

    The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

    tms_utime

        The CPU time charged for the execution of user instructions.

    tms_stime

        The CPU time charged for execution by the system on behalf of the
        process.

    tms_cutime

        The sum of the tms_utime and tms_cutime of the child processes.

    tms_cstime

        The sum of the tms_stime and tms_cstime of the child processes.

    All times are in CLK_TCK's of a second.

    The times of a terminated child process are included in the tms_cutime and
    tms_cstime elements of the parent when one of the _ww_aa_ii_tt(2) functions
    returns the process ID of the terminated child to the parent. If an error
    occurs, _tt_ii_mm_ee_ss(2) returns the value -1 and sets errno to indicate the
    error.

    The return value from _tt_ii_mm_ee_ss(2) can overflow the range of a clock_t object.

  EERRRROORRSS

    The _tt_ii_mm_ee_ss(2) function may fail for these errors:

    [EFAULT]
        The tp argument is an invalid address.
