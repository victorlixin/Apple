    The parameter s is a socket.

    *     If it is of type SOCK_DGRAM, this call specifies the peer with which
          the socket is to be associated; this address is that to which
          datagrams are to be sent, and the only address from which datagrams
          are to be received.
    *     If the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM, this call attempts to make a
          connection to another socket.

    The other socket is specified by addr, which is an address in the
    communications space of the socket. Each communications space interprets
    the addr parameter in its own way. Generally, stream sockets may
    successfully _cc_oo_nn_nn_ee_cc_tt(2) only once; datagram sockets may use _cc_oo_nn_nn_ee_cc_tt(2)
    multiple times to change their association. Datagram sockets may dissolve
    the association by connecting to an invalid address, such as a null
    address.

    If the connection or binding succeeds, 0 is returned. Otherwise a -1 is
    returned, and a more specific error code is stored in errno

    The _cc_oo_nn_nn_ee_cc_tt(2) call fails if:

    [EADDRINUSE]
        The address is already in use.

    [EADDRNOTAVAIL]

        The specified address is not available on this machine.

    [EAFNOSUPPORT]
        Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this
        socket.

    [EALREADY]
        The socket is non-blocking and a previous connection attempt has not
        yet been completed.

    [EBADF]
        S is not a valid descriptor.

    [ECONNREFUSED]
        The attempt to connect was forcefully rejected.

    [EFAULT]
        The addr parameter specifies an area outside the process address
        space.

    [EINPROGRESS]
        The socket is non-blocking and the connection cannot be completed
        immediately. It is possible to _ss_ee_ll_ee_cc_tt(2) for completion by selecting
        the socket for writing.

    [EISCONN]
        The socket is already connected.

    [ENETUNREACH]
        The network isn't reachable from this host.

    [ENOTSOCK]
        S is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.

    [ETIMEDOUT]
        Connection establishment timed out without establishing a connection.

    The following errors are specific to sockets using the AF_LOCAL protocol
    family (previously known as AF_UNIX).

    [EACCES]
        Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.

    [EACCES]
        Write access to the named socket is denied.

    [EINVAL]
        The pathname contains a character with the high-order bit set, or the
        call was applied against a device that doesn't support sockets.

    [ELOOP]
        Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.

    [ENAMETOOLONG]
        A component of a pathname exceeded {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire
        path name exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.

    [ENOENT]
        The named socket does not exist.

    [ENOTDIR]
        A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
