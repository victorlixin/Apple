    The pptthhrreeaadd__rrwwlloocckk__uunnlloocckk(2) function releases a lock held by the calling
    thread on the read-write lock object referenced by the lock argument. If
    the read-write lock object was locked for a write operation, or if only
    one read lock was held on the read-write lock object, the read-write lock
    object is unlocked when the function returns. If more than one read lock
    was held on the read-write lock object, then the lock count on the object
    is decremented and the read-write object continues to be locked for
    reading.

    If threads are blocked on the read-write lock object when it is released,
    then the current scheduling policy determines which thread or threads
    acquire the lock.

    On success, the function returns 0; otherwise, an error code is returned.

    The pptthhrreeaadd__rrwwlloocckk__uunnlloocckk() function can fail for the following reasons:

    [EINVAL]
        The lock argument does not refer to a valid read-write lock object.

    [EPERM]
        The calling thread does not hold a lock on the specified read-write
        lock object.

    This function does not return [EINTR].
