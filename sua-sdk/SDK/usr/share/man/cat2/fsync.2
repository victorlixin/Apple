    The _ff_ss_yy_nn_cc(2) call flushes the buffer for the specified file descriptor
    causes all modified data and attributes of fd to be moved to a permanent
    storage device. It flushes to disk the buffers for the specified file
    descriptor.

    Use _ff_ss_yy_nn_cc(2) in programs that require a file to be in a known state, for
    example, in building a simple transaction facility.
