    The _ss_yy_ss_cc_oo_nn_ff(2) function provides a method for applications to determine
    the current value of a configurable system limit or option variable. The
    name argument specifies the system variable to be queried. Symbolic
    constants for each name value are found in the include file <<uunniissttdd..hh>>.

    The definitive list of symbolic constants is in the include file. As of
