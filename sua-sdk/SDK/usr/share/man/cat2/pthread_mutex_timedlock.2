    The pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__ttiimmeeddlloocckk(2) locks the mutex referenced by the mutex
    argument. If the mutex is already locked, the calling thread is blocked
    until the mutex becomes available, as with the _pp_tt_hh_rr_ee_aa_dd____mm_uu_tt_ee_xx____ll_oo_cc_kk(2)
    function. If the mutex cannot be locked because another thread has the
    mutex locked, the block ends when the system clock reaches the time
    referenced by the abstime argument, or if the time has already passed when
    the call is made.

    On success, the function returns 0; otherwise, an error code is returned.

    The pptthhrreeaadd__mmuutteexx__ttiimmeeddlloocckk() function can fail for the following reasons:

    [EAGAIN]
        The mutex could not be locked because the maximum number of locks on
        the mutex has been reached.

    [EDEADLK]
        The calling thread already owns the mutex.

    [EINVAL]
        The mutex was created with the protocol attribute set to
        PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT and the calling thread's priority is higher than
        the mutex's current priority ceiling.
        The process or thread would have blocked, and the abstime argument
        specifies a value in nanoseconds less than zero or greater than or
        equal to 1000 million.
        The mutex argument does not refer to a valid mutex object.

    [ETIMEDOUT]
        The mutex could not be locked before the specified time passed.

    This function does not return [EINTR].
