    The _ss_ll_ee_ee_pp(2) function suspends execution of the calling process for at
    least seconds of time, or until a signal is delivered to the calling
    process which invokes a signal-catching function or terminates the
    process. System activity or time spent in processing the call may lengthen
    the sleep.
