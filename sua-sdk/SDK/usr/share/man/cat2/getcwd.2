    The _gg_ee_tt_cc_ww_dd(2) function copies the absolute pathname of the current working
    directory into the memory referenced by buf and returns a pointer to buf.
    The size argument is the size, in bytes, of the array referenced by buf.

    This routine has traditionally been used by programs to save the name of a
    working directory for the purpose of returning to it. It is a replacement
    for ggeettwwdd(), which is deprecated for security reasons.

    Upon successful completion, a pointer to the pathname is returned.
    Otherwise a NULL pointer is returned and the global variable errno is set
    to indicate the error.

    If an error occurs, the contents of buf are not changed.

    The _gg_ee_tt_cc_ww_dd(2) function will fail if:

    [EINVAL]
        The size argument is zero.

    [ENOENT]
        A component of the pathname no longer exists.

    [ENOMEM]
        Insufficient memory is available.

    [ERANGE]
        The size argument is greater than zero but smaller than the length of
        the pathname plus 1.
