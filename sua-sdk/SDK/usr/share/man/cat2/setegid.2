    The _ss_ee_tt_uu_ii_dd(2) function sets the real and effective user IDs and the saved
    set-user-ID of the current process to the specified value. The _ss_ee_tt_uu_ii_dd(2)
    function is permitted if the specified ID is equal to the real user ID of
    the process, or if the effective user ID has the appropriate privileges.

    The _ss_ee_tt_gg_ii_dd(2) function sets the real and effective group IDs and the saved
    set-group-ID of the current process to the specified value. The _ss_ee_tt_gg_ii_dd(2)
    function is permitted if the specified ID is equal to the real group ID of
    the process, or if the effective user ID has the appropriate privileges.

    For more details on security and appropriate permissions, see _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y in
    the "Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications Overview" topic of the Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications Help. Future
    releases of Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications may have a different implementation.

    The _ss_ee_tt_ee_uu_ii_dd(2) function _ss_ee_tt_ee_gg_ii_dd(2) sets the effective user ID (group ID)
    of the current process. The effective user ID may be set to the value of
    the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID (see _ee_xx_ee_cc_vv_ee(2)); in this way,
    the effective user ID of a set-user-ID executable may be toggled by
    switching to the real user ID, then re-enabled by reverting to the set-
    user-ID value. Similarly, the effective group ID may be set to the value
    of the real group ID or the saved set-user-ID.

    Upon success, these functions return 0; otherwise -1 is returned.

    If the user is not the superuser, or the uid specified is not the real,
    effective ID, or saved ID, these functions return -1.

    The sseettuuiidd(2) and sseetteeuuiidd(2) functions can fail for the following reasons:

    [EINVAL]
        The value of the uid argument is invalid.

    [EPERM]
        The process does not have appropriate privileges and uid does not
        match the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID.

    The sseetteeggiidd(2) and sseetteeggiidd(2) functions can fail for the following
    reasons:

    [EINVAL]
        The value of the gid argument is invalid.

    [EPERM]
        The process does not have appropriate privileges and gid does not
        match the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID.

    The appropriate privileges are granted to the following users: The SYSTEM
    account, the Administrator account of the principal domain, and the
    Administrator account of the local domain.

    The local Administrator account is restricted to setting the UID to local
    accounts.

    By default, Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications does not execute files with the set-user-ID (setuid)
    or set-group-ID (setgid) mode bit set for security reasons. If an attempt
    is made to execute such a file, the ENOSETUID error is returned. For more
    information and and instructions for enabling execution of files with
    these mode bits set, see _T_h_e_ _s_u_p_e_r_u_s_e_r_ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_ _a_n_d_ _a_p_p_r_o_p_r_i_a_t_e_ _p_r_i_v_i_l_e_g_e_s
