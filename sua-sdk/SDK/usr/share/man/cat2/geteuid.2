    The _gg_ee_tt_uu_ii_dd(2) function returns the real user ID of the calling process.
    The _gg_ee_tt_ee_uu_ii_dd(2) function returns the effective user ID of the calling
    process.

    The real user ID is that of the user who has invoked the program.

    The effective user ID is the user ID of the process, if it has the set-
    user-ID mode set. Since the effective user ID gives the process additional
    permissions during execution, _gg_ee_tt_uu_ii_dd(2) is used to determine the real user
    ID of the calling process.
