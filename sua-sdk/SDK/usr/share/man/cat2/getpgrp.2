    The _gg_ee_tt_pp_gg_rr_pp(2) function returns the process group ID of the current
    process.

    Process groups are used for distribution of signals, and by terminals to
    arbitrate requests for their input: processes that have the same process
    group as the terminal are foreground and may read, while others will block
    with a signal if they attempt to read.
