    If the process has a controlling terminal, the ttccsseettppggrrpp(2) function sets
    the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal device to
    pgrp_id. The terminal device associated with fd must be the controlling
    terminal of the calling process and the controlling terminal must be
    currently associated with the session of the calling process. The value of
    pgrp_id must be the same as the process group ID of a process in the same
    session as the calling process.

    Upon successful completion, ttccsseettppggrrpp(2) returns a value of zero.

    If an error occurs, ttccggeettppggrrpp(2) returns -1 and the global variable errno
    is set to indicate the error, as follows:

    [EBADF]
        The fd argument is not a valid file descriptor.

    [EINVAL]
        An invalid value of pgrp_id was specified.

    [ENOTTY]
        The calling process does not have a controlling terminal, or the file
        represented by fd is not the controlling terminal, or the controlling
        terminal is no longer associated with the session of the calling
        process.

    [EPERM]
        The pgrp_id argument does not match the process group ID of a process
        in the same session as the calling process.
