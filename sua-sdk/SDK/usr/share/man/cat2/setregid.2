    setregid() - set real and effective group ID

    The real and effective group ID's of the current process are set to the
    arguments. Unprivileged users may change the real group ID to the
    effective group ID and vice-versa; only the superuser may make other
    changes.

    Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective group ID forces
    the system to substitute the current ID in place of the -1 parameter.

    The _ss_ee_tt_rr_ee_gg_ii_dd(2) function was intended to allow swapping the real and
    effective group IDs in set-group-ID programs to temporarily relinquish the
    set-group-ID value. This function did not work correctly, and its purpose
    is now better served by the use of the _ss_ee_tt_ee_gg_ii_dd(2) function (see
    _ss_ee_tt_uu_ii_dd(2)).

    When setting the real and effective group IDs to the same value, the
    standard _ss_ee_tt_gg_ii_dd(2) function is preferred.

    Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value
    of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

    The _ss_ee_tt_rr_ee_gg_ii_dd(2) call can return the following errors:

    [EPERM]
        The current process is not the superuser and a change other than
        changing the effective group-id to the real group-id was specified.
