    The pptthhrreeaadd__ccoonndd__iinniitt(2) function initializes the condition variable
    referenced by the cond argument using the attributes specified by the attr
    argument. If attr is NULL, default condition variable attributes are used,
    as though the address of a default condition variable attributes object
    had been passed in attr instead. The macro PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER can be
    used to initialize a statically allocated condition variable with default
    attributes.

    The pptthhrreeaadd__ccoonndd__ddeessttrrooyy(2) function destroys (uninitializes) the
    condition variable referenced by cond. The condition variable must be
    reinitialized using pptthhrreeaadd__ccoonndd__iinniitt() before it can be reused.

    The pptthhrreeaadd__ccoonndd__ddeessttrrooyy() function can fail for the following reasons:

    [EBUSY]
        An attempt was made to destroy the condition variable referenced by
        cond while it was still referenced by another thread. For example, the
        application attempted to destroy a condition variable that was being
        by another thread in a call to _pp_tt_hh_rr_ee_aa_dd____cc_oo_nn_dd____tt_ii_mm_ee_dd_ww_aa_ii_tt(2).

    [EINVAL]
        The cond value is invalid.

    The pptthhrreeaadd__ccoonndd__iinniitt() function can fail for the following reasons:

    [EAGAIN]
        There were insufficient resources (other than memory) to initialize
        the condition variable.

    [EBUSY]
        An attempt was made to reinitialize an existing condition variable.

    [EINVAL]
        The attr argument is invalid.

    [ENOMEM]
        There is not enough memory to initialize the condition variable.

    Neither function returns [EINTR].
