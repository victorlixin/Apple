    The _ss_cc_rr_oo_ll_ll(3) routine scrolls the window up one line. This involves moving
    the lines in the window data structure. As an optimization, if the
    scrolling region of the window is the entire screen, the physical screen
    may be scrolled at the same time.

    For positive n, the _ss_cc_rr_ll(3) and _ww_ss_cc_rr_ll(3) routines scroll the window up n
    lines (line i+n becomes i); otherwise scroll the window down n lines. This
    involves moving the lines in the window character image structure. The
    current cursor position is not changed.

    For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via _ss_cc_rr_oo_ll_ll_oo_kk(3).

    These routines return ERR upon failure, and OK (SVr4 only specifies "an
    integer value other than ERR") upon successful completion.

    Note that _ss_cc_rr_ll(3) and _ss_cc_rr_oo_ll_ll(3) may be macros.

    The SVr4 documentation says that the optimization of physically scrolling
    immediately if the scroll region is the entire screen "is" performed, not
    "may be" performed. This implementation deliberately does not guarantee
    that this will occur, in order to leave open the possibility of smarter
    optimization of multiple scroll actions on the next update.

    Neither the SVr4 documentation specifies whether the current attribute or
    current color-pair of blanks generated by the scroll function is zeroed.
    Under this implementation it is.
