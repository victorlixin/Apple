    The tt__cclloossee(3) function informs the transport provider that the user is
    finished with the transport endpoint specified by fd, and frees any local
    library resources associated with the endpoint. In addition, tt__cclloossee(3)
    closes the file associated with the transport endpoint.

    The function tt__cclloossee(3) should be called from the T_UNBND state (see
    _tt____gg_ee_tt_ss_tt_aa_tt_ee(3)). However, this function does not check state information,
    so it may be called from any state to close a transport endpoint. If this
    occurs, the local library resources associated with the endpoint will be
    freed automatically. In addition, _cc_ll_oo_ss_ee(2) will be issued for that file
    descriptor; if there are no other descriptors in this process or in
    another process which references the communication endpoint, any
    connection that may be associated with that endpoint is broken. The
    connection may be terminated in an orderly or abortive manner.

    A tt__cclloossee(3) issued on a connection endpoint may cause data previously
    sent, or data not yet received, to be lost. It is the responsibility of
    the transport user to ensure that data is received by the remote peer.

    On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following values:

    [TBADF]
        The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.

    [TPROTO]
        This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected
        between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other
        suitable XTI error (t_errno).

    [TSYSERR]
        A system error has occurred during execution of this function.

    Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value
    of -1 is returned and t_errno is set to indicate an error.
