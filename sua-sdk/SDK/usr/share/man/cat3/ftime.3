    The _ff_tt_ii_mm_ee(3) call gets the current date and time and stores them in the
    ttiimmee and mmiilllliittmm members of the ttiimmeebb structure referenced by tp. The time
    is the time since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970. The ttiimmee member contains
    seconds and the mmiilllliittmm member contains milliseconds.

    This implementation also sets the ttiimmeezzoonnee member to the time zone in
    minutes and the ddssttffllaagg member to 1 if Daylight Savings Time can happen in
    the current time zone. However, this behavior is not supported on all
    systems.

    Note that depending upon the granularity of the system clock is a non-
    portable coding practice.
