    The wwccttyyppee(3) function is defined for valid character class names as
    defined in the current locale. The property is a string identifying a
    generic character class for which codeset-specific type information is
    required. The following character class names are defined in all locales -
    "alnum", "alpha", "blank", "cntrl", "digit", "graph", "lower", "print",
    "punct", "space", "upper" and "xdigit".

    Additional character class names defined in the locale definition file
    (category LC_CTYPE) can also be specified.

    The function returns a value of type wctype_t, which can be used as the
    second argument to subsequent calls of _ii_ss_ww_cc_tt_yy_pp_ee(3). The wwccttyyppee(3) function
    determines values of wctype_t according to the rules of the coded
    character set defined by character type information in the program's
    locale (category LC_CTYPE). The values returned by wwccttyyppee(3) are valid
    until a call to _ss_ee_tt_ll_oo_cc_aa_ll_ee(3). that modifies the category LC_CTYPE.

    The arguments are:

    property
        A pointer to string containing a character class name.

    If the wwccttyyppee(3) call is successful it returns an object of type wctype_t
    that can be used in calls to _ii_ss_ww_cc_tt_yy_pp_ee(3). If the given character class
    name is not valid for the current locale (category LC_CTYPE) the wwccttyyppee(3)
    call fails and it returns 0.
