    On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:

    [TBADF]
        The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.

    [TPROTO]
        This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected
        between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other
        suitable XTI error (t_errno).

    [TSTATECHNG]
        The transport provider is undergoing a transient state change.

    [TSYSERR]
        A system error has occurred during execution of this function.

    State is returned upon successful completion. Otherwise, a value of -1 is
    returned and t_errno is set to indicate an error. The current state is one
    of the following:

    T_UNBND
        Unbound.

    T_IDLE
        Idle.

    T_OUTCON
        Outgoing connection pending.

    T_INCON
        Incoming connection pending.

    T_DATAXFER
        Data transfer.

    T_OUTREL
        Outgoing direction orderly release sent.

    T_INREL
        Incoming direction orderly release received. If the provider is
        undergoing a state transition when tt__ggeettssttaattee() is called, the
        function will fail.
