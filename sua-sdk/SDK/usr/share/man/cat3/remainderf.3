REMAINDER(3)	                                        	  REMAINDER(3)

NAME
     remainder, remainderf, remquo, remquof -- minimal residue functions

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double
     remainder(double x, double y);

     float
     remainderf(float x, float y);

     double
     remquo(double x, double y, int *quo);

     float
     remquo(float x, float y, int *quo);

DESCRIPTION
     rreemmaaiinnddeerr(), rreemmaaiinnddeerrff(), remquo(), and remquof() return the remainder r
     := x - n*y where n is the integer nearest the exact value of x/y; more-
     over if |n - x/y| = 1/2 then n is even.  Consequently the remainder is
     computed exactly and |r| <= |y|/2.  But attempting to take the remainder
     when y is 0 or x is ±infinity is an invalid operation that produces a
     NaN.

     The remquo() and remquof() functions also store the last k bits of n in
     the location pointed to by quo, provided that n exists.  The number of
     bits k is platform-specific, but is guaranteed to be at least 3.

STANDARDS
     The rreemmaaiinnddeerr(), rreemmaaiinnddeerrff(), remquo(), and remquof() routines conform
     to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (``ISO C99'').  The remainder is as defined in IEEE
     Std 754-1985.

HISTORY
     The rreemmaaiinnddeerr() and rreemmaaiinnddeerrff() functions appeared in 4.3BSD and
     FreeBSD 2.0, respectively.  The remquo() and remquof() functions were
     added in FreeBSD 5.5.


USAGE NOTES

     The rreemmaaiinnddeerrff function is thread safe.
     The rreemmaaiinnddeerrff function is nnoott async-signal safe.
