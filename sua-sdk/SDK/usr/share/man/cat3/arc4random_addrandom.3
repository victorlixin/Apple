    The aarrcc44rraannddoomm function provides a high quality 32-bit pseudo-random
    number very quickly. The aarrcc44rraannddoomm function seeds itself on a regular
    basis from the kernel strong random number subsystem. On each call, an
    ARC4 generator is used to generate a new result. The aarrcc44rraannddoomm function
    uses the ARC4 cipher key stream generator, which uses 8*8 8-bit S-Boxes.
    The S-Boxes can be in about (2**1700) states.

    The aarrcc44rraannddoomm function fits into a middle ground not covered by other
    subsystems.

    The aarrcc44rraannddoomm__ssttiirr function reads data from //ddeevv//aarraannddoomm and uses it to
    permute the S-Boxes via aarrcc44rraannddoomm__aaddddrraannddoomm.

    There is no need to call aarrcc44rraannddoomm__ssttiirr before using aarrcc44rraannddoomm, since
    aarrcc44rraannddoomm automatically initializes itself.

    An algorithm called RC4 was designed by RSA Data Security, Inc. It was
    considered a trade secret, but not trademarked. Because it was a trade
    secret, it obviously could not be patented. A clone of this was posted
    anonymously to USENET and confirmed to be equivalent by several sources
    who had access to the original cipher. Because of the trade secret
    situation, RSA Data Security, Inc. can do nothing about the release of the
    ARC4 algorithm. Since RC4 used to be a trade secret, the cipher is now
    referred to as ARC4.
