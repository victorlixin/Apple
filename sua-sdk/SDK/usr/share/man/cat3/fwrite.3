    The function _ff_rr_ee_aa_dd(3) reads nmemb objects, each ssiizzee(1) bytes long, from
    the stream pointed to by stream, storing them at the location given by
    ptr.

    The function _ff_ww_rr_ii_tt_ee(3) writes nmemb objects, each size bytes long, to the
    stream pointed to by stream, obtaining them from the location given by
    ptr. The functions _ff_rr_ee_aa_dd(3) and _ff_ww_rr_ii_tt_ee(3) advance the file position
    indicator for the stream by the number of bytes read or written.

    The _ff_rr_ee_aa_dd(3) and _ff_ww_rr_ii_tt_ee(3) functions return the number of objects read or written. If an
    error occurs, or the end-of-file is reached, the return value is a short
    object count (or zero).

    Because the function _ff_rr_ee_aa_dd(3) does not distinguish between end-of-file and
    error, callers must use _ff_ee_oo_ff(3) and _ff_ee_rr_rr_oo_rr(3) to determine which occurred.

    The function _ff_ww_rr_ii_tt_ee(3) returns a value less than nmemb only if a write
    error has occurred.

  EERRRROORRSS

    _ff_rr_ee_aa_dd(3) can set errno to the following values:

    [EBADF]
        Stream is not a valid file or socket descriptor open for reading.

    [EFAULT]
        Ptr points outside the allocated address space.

    [EIO]
        An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

    [EINTR]
        Before any data arrived, a read from a slow device was interrupted by
        the delivery of a signal.

    [EINVAL]
        The pointer associated with stream was negative.

    [EAGAIN]
        The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data were ready to be
        read.

    _ff_ww_rr_ii_tt_ee(3) can set errno to the following values:

    [EBADF]
        Stream is not a valid descriptor open for writing.

    [EPIPE]
        An attempt is made to write to a pipe that is not open for reading by
        any process.

    [EFBIG]
        An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the process's file
        size limit or the maximum file size.

    [EFAULT]
        Part of the data to be written to the file points outside the
        process's allocated address space.

    [EINVAL]
        The pointer associated with stream was negative.

    [ENOSPC]
        There is no free space remaining on the file system containing the
        file.

    [EIO]
        An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file
        system.

    [EAGAIN]
        The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data could be written
        immediately.
