    The _dd_ll_cc_ll_oo_ss_ee(3) call dereferences the handle, closing the object it refers
    to. (The handle is returned by a _dd_ll_oo_pp_ee_nn(3) call, and is used to load a
    shared library object.)

    After a call to _dd_ll_cc_ll_oo_ss_ee(3), the handle is invalid and the object is no
    longer loaded. Any other objects loaded automatically (see _dd_ll_oo_pp_ee_nn(3)) are
    also no longer loaded.

    References to a particular handle should be kept between the _dd_ll_oo_pp_ee_nn(3) and
    _dd_ll_cc_ll_oo_ss_ee(3) calls that use that handle, since the handle may be reused and
    returned by a subsequent call to _dd_ll_oo_pp_ee_nn(3) that refers to a different
    object.

    The _dd_ll_cc_ll_oo_ss_ee(3) call returns 0 if the object is closed, and non-zero if the
    handle was invalid or if the object couldn't be closed. For more
    information about the cause of a non-zero return value, use _dd_ll_ee_rr_rr_oo_rr(3).
