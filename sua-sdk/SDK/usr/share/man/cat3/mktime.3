    The function _mm_kk_tt_ii_mm_ee(3) converts the local time, expressed in the structure
    pointed to by tm into a ttiimmee__tt time value with the same encoding as that
    of the values returned by the _tt_ii_mm_ee(2) function, that is, seconds from the
    Epoch, UTC.

    The original values of the tm_wday and tm_yday components of the structure
    are ignored, and the original values of the other components are not
    restricted to their normal ranges. (A positive or zero value for tm_isdst
    causes _mm_kk_tt_ii_mm_ee(3) to presume initially that summer time (for example,
    Daylight Saving Time) is or is not in effect for the specified time,
    respectively. A negative value for tm_isdst causes the _mm_kk_tt_ii_mm_ee(3) function
    to attempt to divine whether summer time is in effect for the specified
    time.)

    On successful completion, the values of the tm_wday and tm_yday components
    of the structure are set appropriately, and the other components are set
    to represent the specified calendar time, but with their values forced to
    their normal ranges; the final value of tm_mday is not set until tm_mon
    and tm_year are determined. _mm_kk_tt_ii_mm_ee(3) returns the specified calendar time;
    if the calendar time cannot be represented, it returns -1.

    External declarations as well as the ttmm structure definition are in the
    <<ttiimmee...hh>> include file. The ttmm structure includes at least the following
    fields:
    int     tm_sec;       seconds (0 - 60)

    int     tm_min;       minutes (0 - 59)

    int     tm_hour;      hours (0 - 23)

    int     tm_mday;      day of month (1 - 31)

    int     tm_mon;       month of year (0 - 11)

    int     tm_year;      year - 1900

    int     tm_wday;      day of week (Sunday = 0)

    int     tm_yday;      day of year (0 - 365)

    int     tm_isdst;     is summer time in effect?

    The field tm_isdst is non-zero if summer time is in effect.
