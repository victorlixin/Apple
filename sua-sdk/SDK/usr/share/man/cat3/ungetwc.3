    The _uu_nn_gg_ee_tt_ww_cc(3) function pushes the wide-character code wc back onto the
    input stream pointed to by stream. The pushed-backed characters will be
    returned by subsequent reads on the stream (in reverse order). A
    successful intervening call, using the same stream, to one of the file
    positioning functions (_ff_ss_ee_ee_kk(3), _ff_ss_ee_tt_pp_oo_ss(3), or _rr_ee_ww_ii_nn_dd(3)) will discard
    the pushed back characters.

    One character of push-back is guaranteed, but as long as there is
    sufficient memory, an effectively infinite amount of pushback is allowed.

    If a character is successfully pushed-back, the end-of-file indicator for
    the stream is cleared.

    If the value of the argument wc character equals WEOF, the operation will
    fail and the stream will remain unchanged.

    The _uu_nn_gg_ee_tt_ww_cc(3) function returns the character pushed-back after the
    conversion, or WEOF if the operation fails.
