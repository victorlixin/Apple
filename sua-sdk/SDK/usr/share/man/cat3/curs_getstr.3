    The function _gg_ee_tt_ss_tt_rr(3) is equivalent to a series of calls to _gg_ee_tt_cc_hh(3),
    until a newline or carriage return is received (the terminating character
    is not included in the returned string). The resulting value is placed in
    the area pointed to by the character pointer str.

    _ww_gg_ee_tt_nn_ss_tt_rr(3) reads at most n characters, thus preventing a possible
    overflow of the input buffer. Any attempt to enter more characters (other
    than the terminating newline or carriage return) causes a beep. Function
    keys also cause a beep and are ignored.

    The user's erase and kill characters are interpreted. If keypad mode is on
    for the window, KEY_LEFT and KEY_BACKSPACE are both considered equivalent
    to the user's kill character.

    Characters input are echoed only if _ee_cc_hh_oo(3) is currently on. In that case,
    backspace is echoed as deletion of the previous character (typically a
    left motion).

    All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an OK (SVr4 specifies
    only "an integer value other than ERR") upon successful completion.

    These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4. They
    read single-byte characters only. The standard specifies that they return
    ERR on failure, but the single error condition [EOVERFLOW] associated with
    extended-level conformance is not yet returned (the XSI curses support for
    multi-byte characters is not yet present).

    SVr3 and early SVr4 curses implementations did not reject function keys;
    the SVr4.0 documentation claimed that special keys (such as function keys,
    home key, clear key, etc.) are interpreted without giving details. It
    lied. In fact, the `character' value appended to the string by those
    implementations was predictable but not useful (being, in fact, the low-
    order eight bits of the key's KEY_ value).

    The functions ggeettnnssttrr(), mmvvggeettnnssttrr(), and mmvvwwggeettnnssttrr() were present but
    not documented in SVr4.
