    The _ww_cc_ss_ss_ee_pp(3) function locates, in the wide-character string referenced by
    *wstringp the first occurrence of any character in the wide-character
    string wdelim (or the terminating \0 character) and replaces it with a \0.
    The location of the next character after the delimiter character (or NULL,
    if the end of the string was reached) is stored in *wstringp The original
    value of *stringp is returned.

    An "empty" field, i.e. one caused by two adjacent delimiter characters,
    can be detected by comparing the location referenced by the pointer
    returned in *wstringp to \0.

    If *wstringp is initially NULL, _ww_cc_ss_ss_ee_pp(3) returns NULL.

    The following uses _ww_cc_ss_ss_ee_pp(3) to parse a string, containing tokens
    delimited by white space, into an argument vector:

    wchar_t **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;
    for (ap = argv; (*ap = wcssep(&inputstring, L" \t")) != NULL;)
         if (**ap != '\0')
              ++ap;

    The _ww_cc_ss_ss_ee_pp(3) function is intended as a replacement for the _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_kk(3)
    function. While the _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_kk(3) function should be preferred for portability
    reasons (it conforms to ISO> C) it is unable to handle empty fields, i.e.
    detect fields delimited by two adjacent delimiter characters, or to be
    used for more than a single string at a time. The _ww_cc_ss_ss_ee_pp(3) function first
    appeared in 4.4BSD.
