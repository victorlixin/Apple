    The _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_mm_bb_ss(3) function converts the sequence of wide-character codes in
    the array pointed to by pwcs to a sequence of characters that begins in
    the initial shift state and stores these characters in the array pointed
    to by s, stopping if a character would exceed the limit of n total bytes
    or if a null byte is stored. Each wide-character code is converted as if
    by a call to _ww_cc_tt_oo_mm_bb(3), except that the shift state of _ww_cc_tt_oo_mm_bb(3) is not
    affected.

    The behavior of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of the
    current locale.

    No more than n bytes will be modified in the array pointed to by s. If
    copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
    undefined. If s is a null pointer, _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_mm_bb_ss(3) returns the length required
    to convert the entire array regardless of the value of n, but no values
    are stored.

    The _ww_cc_ss_nn_tt_oo_mm_bb_ss(3) function is identical to _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_mm_bb_ss(3), except that only
    the number of characters specified by the m argument are converted.

    If a wide-character code is encountered that does not correspond to a
    valid character (of one or more bytes each), both functions return
    (ssiizzee__tt)-1 and may set errno to indicate the error. Otherwise both
    functions return the number of bytes stored in the character array, not
    including any terminating null byte. The array will not be null-terminated
    if the value returned is n.

    Either function may fail if:

    [EILSEQ]
        A wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.
