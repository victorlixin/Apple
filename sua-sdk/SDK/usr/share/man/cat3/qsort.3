    The _qq_ss_oo_rr_tt(3) function is a modified partition-exchange sort, or quicksort.

    The _qq_ss_oo_rr_tt(3) function sorts an array of nmemb objects, the initial member
    of which is pointed to by base. The size of each object is specified by
    size.

    The contents of the array base are sorted in ascending order according to
    a comparison function pointed to by compar, which requires two arguments
    pointing to the objects being compared.

    The comparison function must return an integer less than, equal to, or
    greater than zero if the first argument is considered to be respectively
    less than, equal to, or greater than the second.

    _QQ_ss_oo_rr_tt(3) is not stable, that is, if two members compare as equal, their
    order in the sorted array is undefined. While _qq_ss_oo_rr_tt(3) does not allocate
    memory, it is implemented using recursion.
