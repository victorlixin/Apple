    The function ggmmttiimmee(3) unction takes as an argument a time value
    representing the time in seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1,
    1970; see _tt_ii_mm_ee(2)). It converts the time value pointed at by clock, and
    returns a pointer to a ssttrruucctt ttmm (described below) which contains the
    broken-out time information for the value without adjusting for time zones
    or other factors such as Daylight Saving Time). It then returns a pointer
    to a ttmm structure (described below).

    All the fields have constant width.

    External declarations as well as the tm structure definition are in the
    <<ttiimmee..hh>> include file. The ttmm structure includes at least the following
    fields:
    int     tm_sec;       seconds (0 - 60)

    int     tm_min;       minutes (0 - 59)

    int     tm_hour;      hours (0 - 23)

    int     tm_mday;      day of month (1 - 31)

    int     tm_mon;       month of year (0 - 11)

    int     tm_year;      year - 1900

    int     tm_wday;      day of week (Sunday = 0)

    int     tm_yday;      day of year (0 - 365)

    int     tm_isdst;     is summer time in effect?

    The field tm_isdst is non-zero if Daylight Saving Time is in effect.

    The reentrant ggmmttiimmee__rr(3) function converts the time in seconds since the
    Epoch pointed to by clock into a broken-down time expressed as Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC) and stores the broken-down time in the structure
    identified by result. On success, the ggmmttiimmee__rr(3) function also returns
    the address of the same structure; otherwise, it returns a null pointer.

    The ggmmttiimmee__rr function is thread safe. The ggmmttiimmee function is not thread
    safe.

    None of these functions are async-signal safe.
