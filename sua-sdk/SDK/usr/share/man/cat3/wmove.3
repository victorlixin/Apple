    These routines move the cursor associated with the window to line yand
    column x. This routine does not move the physical cursor of the terminal
    until _rr_ee_ff_rr_ee_ss_hh(3) is called. The position specified is relative to the
    upper left-hand corner of the window, which is (0,0).

    These routines return ERR upon failure and OK (SVr4 specifies only "an
    integer value other than ERR") upon successful completion.

    These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4. The
    standard specifies that if (y x) is within a multi-column character, the
    cursor is moved to the first column of that character; however, this
    implementation does not yet support the extended-level XSI multi-byte
    characters.
