    The tt__uunnbbiinndd(3) function disables the transport endpoint specified by fd
    which was previously bound by _tt____bb_ii_nn_dd(3). On completion of this call, no
    further data or events destined for this transport endpoint will be
    accepted by the transport provider. An endpoint which is disabled by using
    tt__uunnbbiinndd(3) can be enabled by a subsequent call to _tt____bb_ii_nn_dd(3).

    On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:

    [TBADF]
        The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.

    [TLOOK]
        An asynchronous event has occurred on this transport endpoint.

    [TOUTSTATE]
        The communications endpoint referenced by fd is not in one of the
        states in which a call to this function is valid.

    [TPROTO]
        This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected
        between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other
        suitable XTI error (t_errno).

    [TSYSERR]
        A system error has occurred during execution of this function.
