    The _rr_ee_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3) function changes the size of the object pointed to by ptr
    to the size specified by size. The contents of the object are unchanged up
    to the lesser of the new and old sizes. If the new size is larger, the
    value of the newly allocated portion of the object is indeterminate. If
    ptr is a null pointer, the _rr_ee_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3) function behaves like the _mm_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3)
    function for the specified size. Otherwise, if ptr does not match a
    pointer earlier returned by the _cc_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3), _mm_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3), or _rr_ee_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3)
    function, or if the space has been deallocated by a call to the ffrreeee(3) or
    _rr_ee_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3) function, unpredictable and usually detrimental behavior will
    occur. If the space cannot be allocated, the object pointed to by ptr is
    unchanged. If size is zero and ptr is not a null pointer, the object it
    points to is freed.

    The _rr_ee_aa_ll_ll_oo_cc(3) function returns either a null pointer or a pointer to the
    possibly moved allocated space.
