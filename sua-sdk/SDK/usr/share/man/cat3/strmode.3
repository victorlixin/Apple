    The _ss_tt_rr_mm_oo_dd_ee(3) function converts a file mode (the type and permission
    information associated with a file, see _ss_tt_aa_tt(2)) into a symbolic string
    which is stored in the location referenced by bp. This stored string is
    eleven characters in length plus a trailing NULL.

    The first character is the file type, and will be one of the following:
    -     regular file

    b     block special

    c     character special

    d     directory

    l     symbolic link

    p     fifo

    s     socket

    ?     unknown type

    The next nine characters encode three sets of permissions, in three
    characters each. The first three characters are the permissions for the
    owner of the file, the second three for the group the file belongs to, and
    the third for the "other", or default, set of users.

    Permission checking is done as specifically as possible. If read
    permission is denied to the owner of a file in the first set of
    permissions, the owner of the file will not be able to read the file. This
    is true even if the owner is in the file's group and the group permissions
    allow reading or the "other" permissions allow reading.

    If the first character of the three character set is an "r", the file is
    readable for that set of users; if a dash "-", it is not readable.

    If the second character of the three character set is a "w", the file is
    writable for that set of users; if a dash "-", it is not writable.

    The third character is the first of the following characters that apply:

    S
        If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is not
        executable or the directory is not searchable by the owner, and the
        set-user-id bit is set.

    S
        If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is not
        executable or the directory is not searchable by the group, and the
        set-group-id bit is set.

    T
        If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is not
        executable or the directory is not searchable by others.

    s
        If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is
        executable or the directory searchable by the owner, and the set-user-
        id bit is set.

    s
        If the character is part of the group permissions and the file is
        executable or the directory searchable by the group, and the set-
        group-id bit is set.

    t
        If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is
        executable or the directory searchable by others.

    x
        The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

    -
        None of the above apply.

    The last character is a plus sign "+" if any there are any alternate or
    additional access control methods associated with the file, otherwise it
    will be a space.
