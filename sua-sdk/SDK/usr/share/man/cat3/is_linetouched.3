    The _tt_oo_uu_cc_hh_ww_ii_nn(3) and _tt_oo_uu_cc_hh_ll_ii_nn_ee(3) routines throw away all optimization
    information about which parts of the window have been touched, by
    pretending that the entire window has been drawn on. This is sometimes
    necessary when using overlapping windows, since a change to one window
    affects the other window, but the records of which lines have been changed
    in the other window do not reflect the change. The routine _tt_oo_uu_cc_hh_ll_ii_nn_ee(3)
    only pretends that count lines have been changed, beginning with line
    start.

    The _uu_nn_tt_oo_uu_cc_hh_ww_ii_nn(3) routine marks all lines in the window as unchanged since
    the last call to _ww_rr_ee_ff_rr_ee_ss_hh(3).

    The _ww_tt_oo_uu_cc_hh_ll_nn(3) routine makes n lines in the window, starting at line y,
    look as if they have been changed (changed or have not been changed
    (changed since the last call to _ww_rr_ee_ff_rr_ee_ss_hh(3).

    specified line/window was modified since the last call to _ww_rr_ee_ff_rr_ee_ss_hh(3);
    otherwise they return FALSE. In addition, _ii_ss____ll_ii_nn_ee_tt_oo_uu_cc_hh_ee_dd(3) returns ERR if

    The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.

    Some historic curses implementations had, as an undocumented feature, the
    ability to do the equivalent of clearok(..., 1) by saying touchwin(stdscr)
    or clear(stdscr). This will not work under nnccuurrsseess
