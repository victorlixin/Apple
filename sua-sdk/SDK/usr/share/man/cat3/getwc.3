    The _ff_gg_ee_tt_ww_cc(3) function obtains the next input wide-character code (if
    present) from the stream pointed at by stream, or the next wide-character
    code pushed back on the stream through _uu_nn_gg_ee_tt_ww_cc(3).

    The _gg_ee_tt_ww_cc(3) function acts essentially identically to _ff_gg_ee_tt_ww_cc(3), but is a
    macro that expands in-line.

    The _gg_ee_tt_ww_cc_hh_aa_rr(3) function is equivalent to:

    getwc(stdin)

    Once end-of-file is reached, the end-of-file condition is remembered, even
    on a terminal, and all subsequent attempts to read will return WEOF until
    the condition is cleared with _cc_ll_ee_aa_rr_ee_rr_rr(3).

    If successful, these routines return the next requested object from the
    stream. If the stream is at end-of-file or a read error occurs, the
    routines return WEOF. Since WEOF is a valid wint_t value, you must use
    _ff_ee_oo_ff(3) and _ff_ee_rr_rr_oo_rr(3) to distinguish between end-of-file and error. If an
    error occurs, the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

  EERRRROORRSS

    These functions can set errno to the following values:

    [EBADF]
        Stream is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.

    [EIO]
        An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

    [EINTR]
        A read from a slow device was interrupted before any data arrived by
        the delivery of a signal.

    [EINVAL]
        The pointer associated with stream was negative.

    [EAGAIN]
        The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data were ready to be
        read.

    [EILSEQ]
        The data obtained from the input stream does not form a valid
        character.
