    The function _pp_oo_ss_tt____mm_ee_nn_uu(3) displays a menu to its associated subwindow. To
    trigger physical display of the subwindow, use _rr_ee_ff_rr_ee_ss_hh(3) or some
    equivalent ccuurrsseess routine (the implicit _dd_oo_uu_pp_dd_aa_tt_ee(3) triggered by an ccuurrsseess
    input request will do).

    The function _uu_nn_pp_oo_ss_tt____mm_ee_nn_uu(3) erases menu from its associated subwindow.
