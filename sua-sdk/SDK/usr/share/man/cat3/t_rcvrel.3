    This function is used to receive an orderly release indication for the
    incoming direction of data transfer.

    fd             x               /

    The argument fd identifies the local transport endpoint where the
    connection exists. After receipt of this indication, the user may not
    attempt to receive more data through _tt____rr_cc_vv(3) or tt__rrccvvvv(3). Such an
    attempt will fail with t_error set to [TOUTSTATE]. However, the user may
    continue to send data over the connection if _tt____ss_nn_dd_rr_ee_ll(3) has not been
    called by the user. This function is an optional service of the transport
    provider, and is only supported if the transport provider returned service
    type T_COTS_ORD on _tt____oo_pp_ee_nn(3) or _tt____gg_ee_tt_ii_nn_ff_oo(3). Any user data that may be
    associated with the orderly release indication is discarded when
    tt__rrccvvrreell(3) is called.

    On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:

    [TBADF]
        The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.

    [TLOOK]
        An asynchronous event has occurred on this transport endpoint and
        requires immediate attention.

    [TNOREL]
        No orderly release indication currently exists on the specified
        transport endpoint.

    [TNOTSUPPORT]
        This function is not supported by the underlying transport provider.

    [TOUTSTATE]
        The communications endpoint referenced by fd is not in one of the
        states in which a call to this function is valid.

    [TPROTO]
        This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected
        between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other
        suitable XTI error (t_errno).

    [TSYSERR]
        A system error has occurred during execution of this function.

    Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value
