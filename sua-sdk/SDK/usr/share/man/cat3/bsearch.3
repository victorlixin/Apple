    The _bb_ss_ee_aa_rr_cc_hh(3) function searches an array of nmemb objects, for a member
    that matches the object pointed to by key. Base points to the initial
    member of the array, and the size of each member of the array is specified
    by size.

    The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order according to
    the comparison function referenced by compar. (See _qq_ss_oo_rr_tt(3)). The compar
    routine is expected to have two arguments which point to the key object
    and to an array member, in that order, and should return an integer less
    than, equal to, or greater than zero if the key object is found,
    respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the array
    member.

    The _bb_ss_ee_aa_rr_cc_hh(3) function returns a pointer to a matching member of the
    array, or NULL if no match is found. If two members compare as equal,
    which member is matched is unspecified.
