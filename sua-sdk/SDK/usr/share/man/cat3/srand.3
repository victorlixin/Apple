    The rraanndd(3) function computes a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the
    range of 0 to {RAND_MAX} (as defined in the header file <<ssttddlliibb..hh>>).

    The ssrraanndd(3) function sets its argument as the seed for a new sequence of
    pseudo-random numbers to be returned by rraanndd(3). These sequences are
    repeatable by calling ssrraanndd(3) with the same seed value.

    The reentrant rraanndd__rr(3) function computes a sequence of pseudo-random
    integers in the range of 0 to {RAND_MAX}. If rraanndd__rr(3) is called with the
    same initial value for the object identified by the seed argument and that
    object is not modified between successive returns and calls to rraanndd__rr(3),
    the same sequence is generated.

    If no seed value is provided, the functions are automatically seeded with
    a value of 1.

    To seed the random number generator with the time (a popular source), you
    can use:

    srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));

    The following functions are thread safe: rraanndd__rr,, ssrraanndd. The rraanndd function
    is not thread safe.

    None of these functions are async-signal safe.
