    The ffnnmmaattcchh(3) and wwccss__ffnnmmaattcchh(3) functions are identical, except that
    wwccss__ffnnmmaattcchh(3) accepts wide characters in the pattern and string
    arguments.

    The ffnnmmaattcchh(3) and wwccss__ffnnmmaattcchh(3) functions match patterns according to
    the rules used by the shell. They check the string specified by the string
    argument to see if it matches the pattern specified by the pattern
    argument.

    The flags argument modifies the interpretation of pattern and string. The
    value of flags is the bitwise inclusive OR of any of the following
    constants, which are defined in the include file <<ffnnmmaattcchh..hh>>.

    FNM_NOESCAPE
        Normally, every occurrence of a backslash (\ followed by a character
        in pattern is replaced by that character. This is done to negate any
        special meaning for the character. If the FNM_NOESCAPE flag is set, a
        backslash character is treated as an ordinary character.

    FNM_PATHNAME
        Slash characters in string must be explicitly matched by slashes in
        pattern. If this flag is not set, then slashes are treated as regular
        characters.

    FNM_PERIOD
        Leading periods in strings match periods in patterns. The definition
        of "leading" is related to the specification of FNM_PATHNAME. A period
        is always "leading" if it is the first character in string.
        Additionally, if FNM_PATHNAME is set, a period is "leading" if it
        immediately follows a slash.

    the pattern specified by pattern, otherwise, they return the value
    FNM_NOMATCH.
