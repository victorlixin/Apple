    The _tt_ee_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3) function is similar to _tt_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3) in that it returns a
    pointer to a pathname of a file that does not exist at the time of the
    call. Unlike _tt_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3), you can specify the directory that will contain
    the file (dir) if there is no defined temporary directory, and you can
    specify the filename's prefix, (pfx).

    The _tt_ee_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3) function also looks to use different directories by default
    than does _tt_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3). It determines the directory for the file using the
    following steps:

   1.     The directory used is the directory defined by TMPDIR if it is
          writeable.
   2.     If the previous step does not produce a usable directory, then the
          directory used is the directory specified by the dir argument if it
          exists and is writeable.
   3.     If the previous step does not produce a usable directory, then the
          directory used is the directory specified by P_tmpdir as declared in
          ssttddiioo..hh if it exists and is writeable.
   4.     If the previous step does not produce a usable directory, then the
          function attempts to use //ttmmpp.

    The argument pfx, if non-NULL, is used to specify a file name prefix,
    which will be the first part of the created file name. The pfx can be up
    to five characters long.

    _TT_ee_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3) allocates space for the string; the pointer can be used in a
    call to _ff_rr_ee_ee(3).

    The _tt_ee_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3) function returns a pointer to a file name on success, and a
    NULL pointer on error.

    The _tt_ee_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3) function may fail and set the global variable errno for
    this reason:

    [ENOMEM]
        There isn't enough memory.

  NNOOTTEESS

    Using _tt_ee_mm_pp_nn_aa_mm(3) is discouraged for these reasons:
   1.     There can be a race between file name selection and file name
          creation.
   2.     There is no specification for the minimum number of unique temporary
          names; some implementations generate as few as 26 before recycling.
   3.     Some implementations use _aa_cc_cc_ee_ss_ss(2) to determine whether the temp
          file may be created. this can cause problems for use with _ss_ee_tt_uu_ii_dd(2)
          and _ss_ee_tt_gg_ii_dd(2) programs.
