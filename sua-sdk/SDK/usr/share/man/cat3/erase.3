    The _ee_rr_aa_ss_ee(3) and _ww_ee_rr_aa_ss_ee(3) routines copy blanks to every position in the
    window, clearing the screen.

    The _cc_ll_ee_aa_rr(3) and _ww_cc_ll_ee_aa_rr(3) routines are like _ee_rr_aa_ss_ee(3) and _ww_ee_rr_aa_ss_ee(3), but
    they also call _cc_ll_ee_aa_rr_oo_kk(3), so that the screen is cleared completely on the
    next call to _ww_rr_ee_ff_rr_ee_ss_hh(3) for that window and repainted from scratch.

    The _cc_ll_rr_tt_oo_bb_oo_tt(3) and _ww_cc_ll_rr_tt_oo_bb_oo_tt(3) routines erase from the cursor to the end
    of screen. That is, they erase all lines below the cursor in the window.
    Also, the current line to the right of the cursor, inclusive, is erased.

    The _cc_ll_rr_tt_oo_ee_oo_ll(3) and _ww_cc_ll_rr_tt_oo_ee_oo_ll(3) routines erase the current line to the
    right of the cursor, inclusive, to the end of the current line.

    Blanks created by erasure have the current background rendition (as set by
    _ww_bb_kk_gg_dd_ss_ee_tt(3)) merged into them.

    All routines return the integer OK. The SVr4.0 manual says "or a non-
    negative integer if _ii_mm_mm_ee_dd_oo_kk(3) is set", but this appears to be an error.

    These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4. The
    standard specifies that they return ERR on failure, but specifies no error
    conditions.

    Some historic curses implementations had, as an undocumented feature, the
    ability to do the equivalent of

    clearok(..., 1)

    by saying

    touchwin(stdscr)

    or

    clear(stdscr)

    This will not work under ncurses.
