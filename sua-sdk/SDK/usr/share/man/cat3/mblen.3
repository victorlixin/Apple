    If s is not a null pointer, the _mm_bb_ll_ee_nn(3) function determines the umber of
    bytes constituting the character pointed to by s, Except that the shift
    state of _mm_bb_tt_oo_ww_cc(3) is not affected, it is equivalent to:

    mbtowc((whcar_t *)0, s, n)

    The behavior of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of the
    current locale. For a state-dependent encoding, this function is placed
    into its initial state by a call for which its character pointer argument,
    s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s as other than a null pointer
    cause the internal state of the function to be altered as necessary. A
    call with s as a null pointer causes this function to return a non-zero
    value if encodings have state dependency, and 0 otherwise. If the
    implementation employs special bytes to change the shift state, these
    bytes do not produce separate wide-character codes, but are grouped with
    an adjacent character. Changing the LC_CTYPE category causes the shift
    state of this function to be indeterminate.

    If s is a null pointer, _mm_bb_ll_ee_nn(3) returns a non-zero or 0 value, if
    character encodings, respectively, do or do not have state-dependent
    encodings. If s is not a null pointer, _mm_bb_ll_ee_nn(3) either returns 0 (if s
    points to the null byte), or returns the number of bytes that constitute
    the character (if the next n or fewer bytes form a valid character), or
    returns -1 (if they do not form a valid character) and may set errno to
    indicate the error. In no case will the value returned be greater than n
    or the value of the MB_CUR_MAX macro.
