    The _ff_ss_ee_ee_kk(3) function sets the file position indicator for the stream
    pointed to by stream. The new position, measured in bytes, is obtained by
    adding offset bytes to the position specified by whence. If whence is set
    to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, the offset is relative to the start of
    the file, the current position indicator, or end-of-file, respectively. A
    successful call to the _ff_ss_ee_ee_kk(3) function clears the end-of-file indicator
    for the stream and undoes any effects of the _uu_nn_gg_ee_tt_cc(3) function on the
    same stream.

    The _ff_tt_ee_ll_ll(3) function obtains the current value of the file position
    indicator for the stream pointed to by stream.

    The _rr_ee_ww_ii_nn_dd(3) function sets the file position indicator for the stream
    pointed to by stream to the beginning of the file. It is equivalent to:

    (void)fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)

    except that the error indicator for the stream is also cleared (see
    _cc_ll_ee_aa_rr_ee_rr_rr(3)).

    The _ff_gg_ee_tt_pp_oo_ss(3) and _ff_ss_ee_tt_pp_oo_ss(3) functions are alternate interfaces
    equivalent to _ff_tt_ee_ll_ll(3) and _ff_ss_ee_ee_kk(3) (with whence set to SEEK_SET), setting
    and storing the current value of the file offset into or from the object
    referenced by pos. On some systems an fpos_t object may be a complex
    object and these routines may be the only way to portably reposition a
    text stream.

    The _rr_ee_ww_ii_nn_dd(3) function returns no value. Upon successful completion,
    _ff_gg_ee_tt_pp_oo_ss(3), _ff_ss_ee_ee_kk(3), _ff_ss_ee_tt_pp_oo_ss(3) return 0, and _ff_tt_ee_ll_ll(3) returns the
    current offset. Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable errno is
    set to indicate the error.

        The stream specified is not a seekable stream.

    [EINVAL]
        The whence argument to _ff_ss_ee_ee_kk(3) was not SEEK_SET, SEEK_END, or
