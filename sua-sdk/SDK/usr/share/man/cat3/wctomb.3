    The _ww_cc_tt_oo_mm_bb(3) function determines the number of bytes needed to represent
    the character corresponding to the wide-character code whose value is
    wchar (including any change in the shift state). It stores the character
    representation (possibly multiple bytes and any special bytes to change
    shift state) in the array object pointed to by s (if s is not a null
    pointer). At most {MB_CUR_MAX} bytes are stored. If wchar is 0, _ww_cc_tt_oo_mm_bb(3)
    is left in the initial shift state.

    The behavior of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of the
    current locale. For a state-dependent encoding, this function is placed
    into its initial state by a call for which its character pointer argument,
    s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s as other than a null pointer
    cause the internal state of the function to be altered as necessary. A
    call with s as a null pointer causes this function to return a non-zero
    value if encodings have state dependency, and 0 otherwise. Changing the
    LC_CTYPE category causes the shift state of this function to be
    indeterminate.

    If s is a null pointer, _ww_cc_tt_oo_mm_bb(3) returns a non-zero or 0 value, if
    character encodings, respectively, do or do not have state-dependent
    encodings. If s is not a null pointer, _ww_cc_tt_oo_mm_bb(3) returns -1 if the value
    of wchar does not correspond to a valid character, or returns the number
    of bytes that constitute the character corresponding to the value of
    wchar.

    In no case will the value returned be greater than the value of the
    MB_CUR_MAX macro.
