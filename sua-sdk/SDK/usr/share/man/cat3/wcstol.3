    The _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_ll(3) function converts the wide-character string in nptr to a
    lloonngg value.

    The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space (as
    determined by _ii_ss_ww_ss_pp_aa_cc_ee(3)) followed by a single optional + or - sign. If
    base is zero or 16, the string may then include a 0x prefix, and the
    number will be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero base is taken as 10
    (decimal) unless the next character is 0, in which case it is taken as 8
    (octal).

    The remainder of the string is converted to a lloonngg value in the obvious
    manner, stopping at the first character which is not a valid digit in the
    given base. (In bases above 10, the letter A or a represents 10, B or b
    represents 11, and so forth, with Z or z representing 35.)

    If endptr is not NULL, _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_ll(3) stores the address of the first invalid
    character in *endptr. If there were no digits at all, however, _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_ll(3)
    stores the original value of nptr in *endptr. (Thus, if *nptr is not \0
    but **endptr is \0 on return, the entire string was valid.)

    The _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_ll(3) function returns the result of the conversion, unless the
    value would underflow or overflow. If an underflow occurs, _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_ll(3)
    returns {LONG_MIN.} If an overflow occurs, _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_ll(3) returns LONG_MAX. In
    both cases, errno is set.

    The _ww_cc_ss_tt_oo_ll(3) function can fail for any of these reasons:

    [ERANGE]
        The given string was out of range; the value converted has been
        clamped.
