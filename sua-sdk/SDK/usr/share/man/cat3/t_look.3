    This function returns the current event on the transport endpoint
    specified by fd. This function enables a transport provider to notify a
    transport user of an asynchronous event when the user is calling functions
    in synchronous mode. Certain events require immediate notification of the
    user and are indicated by a specific error, [TLOOK], on the current or
    next function to be executed.

    This function also enables a transport user to poll a transport endpoint
    periodically for asynchronous events.

    On failure, t_errno is set to one of the following:

    [TBADF]
        The specified file descriptor does not refer to a transport endpoint.

    [TPROTO]
        This error indicates that a communication problem has been detected
        between XTI and the transport provider for which there is no other
        suitable XTI error (t_errno).

    [TSYSERR]
        A system error has occurred during execution of this function.

    Upon success, tt__llooookk() returns a value that indicates which of the
    allowable events has occurred, or returns zero if no event exists. One of
    the following events is returned:

    T_LISTEN
        Connection indication received.

    T_CONNECT
        Connect confirmation received.

    T_DATA
        Normal data received.

    T_EXDATA
        Expedited data received.

    T_DISCONNECT
        Disconnection received.

    T_UDERR
        Datagram error indication.

    T_ORDREL
        Orderly release indication.

    T_GODATA
        Flow control restrictions on normal data flow that led to a [TFLOW]
        error have been lifted. Normal data may be sent again.

    T_GOEXDATA
        Flow control restrictions on expedited data flow that led to a [TFLOW]
        error have been lifted. Expedited data may be sent again.

    On failure, -1 is returned and t_errno is set to indicate the error.
