    The _rr_ee_aa_ll_pp_aa_tt_hh(3) call takes a path as an argument and returns (in the
    resolved buffer) the actual path. It resolves multiple concurrent slashes,
    directory components such as .. and .... and symbolic links. It resolves the
    path by executing _cc_hh_dd_ii_rr(2) and _ss_tt_aa_tt(2).

    The _rr_ee_aa_ll_pp_aa_tt_hh(3) call takes the following arguments:

    path
        A buffer containing the path name to be resolved.

    resolved
        A buffer to contain the resolved path name. The buffer is assumed to
        be at least {PATH_MAX} bytes in size.

    On success, the _rr_ee_aa_ll_pp_aa_tt_hh(3) call returns a pointer to resolved; on
    failure, it returns NULL and sets errno to indicate the error. The
    resolved buffer will contain the intermediate pathname which caused the
    error.

    The _rr_ee_aa_ll_pp_aa_tt_hh(3) call can fail for the following reasons:

    [EINVAL]
        Either path or resolved was NULL.

    [ELOOP]
        The pathname in path involved a links in a loop.

    [ENAMETOOLONG]
        The resolved pathname would have been more than {PATH_MAX} characters
        long.

    [ENOENT]
        The path was invalid.
