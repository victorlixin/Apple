NAME
     lgamma, lgamma_r, lgammaf, lgammaf_r, gamma, gamma_r, gammaf, gammaf_r,
     tgamma -- log gamma functions, gamma function

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     extern int signgam;

     double
     lgamma(double x);

     double
     lgamma_r(double x, int *signgamp);

     float
     lgammaf(float x);

     float
     lgammaf_r(float x, int *signgamp);

     double
     gamma(double x);

     double
     gamma_r(double x, int *signgamp);

     float
     gammaf(float x);

     float
     gammaf_r(float x, int *signgamp);

     double
     tgamma(double x);

DESCRIPTION
     lgamma(x) and lgammaf(x) return ln||¯(x)|.

     The external integer signgam returns the sign of |¯(x).

     lgamma_r(x, signgamp) and lgammaf_r(x, signgamp) provide the same func-
     tionality as lgamma(x) and lgammaf(x) but the caller must provide an
     integer to store the sign of |¯(x).

     ggaammmmaa(), ggaammmmaaff(), gamma_r(), and gammaf_r() are deprecated aliases for
     llggaammmmaa(), llggaammmmaaff(), lgamma_r(), and lgammaf_r(), respectively.
     tgamma(x) returns |¯(x), with no effect on signgam.

IDIOSYNCRASIES
     Do not use the expression ``signgam*exp(lgamma(x))'' to compute g :=
     |¯(x).  Instead use a program like this (in C):

	   lg = lgamma(x); g = signgam*exp(lg);

     Only after llggaammmmaa() or llggaammmmaaff() has returned can signgam be correct.

     For arguments in its range, ttggaammmmaa() is preferred, as for positive argu-
     ments it is accurate to within one unit in the last place.  Exponentia-
     tion of llggaammmmaa() will lose up to 10 significant bits.

RETURN VALUES
     ggaammmmaa(), gamma_r(), ggaammmmaaff(), gammaf_r(), llggaammmmaa(), lgamma_r(),
     llggaammmmaaff(), and lgammaf_r() return appropriate values unless an argument
     is out of range.  Overflow will occur for sufficiently large positive
     values, and non-positive integers.  For large non-integer negative val-
     ues, ttggaammmmaa() will underflow.

STANDARDS
     The llggaammmmaa() and ttggaammmmaa() functions are expected to conform to ISO/IEC
     9899:1999 (``ISO C99'').

HISTORY
     The llggaammmmaa() function appeared in 4.3BSD.	The ggaammmmaa() function appeared
     in 4.4BSD as a function which computed |¯(x).  This version was used in
     FreeBSD 1.1.  The name ggaammmmaa() was originally dedicated to the llggaammmmaa()
     function, and that usage was restored by switching to Sun's fdlibm in
     FreeBSD 1.1.5.  The ttggaammmmaa() function appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.


USAGE NOTES

     The ggaammmmaaff function is thread safe.
     The ggaammmmaaff function is nnoott async-signal safe.
