    The _bb_kk_gg_dd_ss_ee_tt(3) and _ww_bb_kk_gg_dd_ss_ee_tt(3) routines manipulate the background of the
    named window. Background is a cchhttyyppee consisting of any combination of
    attributes and a character. The attribute part of the background is
    combined (ORed) with all non-blank characters that are written into the
    window with _ww_aa_dd_dd_cc_hh(3). Both the character and attribute parts of the
    background are combined with the blank characters. The background becomes
    a property of the character and moves with the character through any
    scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations. To the extent
    possible on a particular terminal, the attribute part of the background is
    displayed as the graphic rendition of the character put on the screen.

    The _bb_kk_gg_dd(3) and _ww_bb_kk_gg_dd(3) routines combine the new background with every
    position in the window. Background is any combination of attributes and a
    character. Only the attribute part is used to set the background of non-
    blank characters, while both character and attributes are used for blank
    positions. To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute
    part of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the
    character put on the screen.

    The wwggeettbbkkggdd() function returns the given window's current background
    character/attribute pair.

    The routines _bb_kk_gg_dd(3) and _ww_bb_kk_gg_dd(3) return the integer OK. The SVr4.0 manual
    says "or a non-negative integer if _ii_mm_mm_ee_dd_oo_kk(3) is set", but this appears to
    be an error.

    These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4. The
    draft does not include ccoonnsstt qualifiers on the arguments. The standard
    specifies that _bb_kk_gg_dd(3) and _ww_bb_kk_gg_dd(3) return ERR on failure, but gives no
    failure conditions. The draft describes the new function wwggeettbbkkggdd(), which
    is not in SVr4.
