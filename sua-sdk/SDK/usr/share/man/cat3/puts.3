    The function _ff_pp_uu_tt_ss(3) writes the string pointed to by str to the stream
    pointed to by stream.

    The function _pp_uu_tt_ss(3) writes the string str and a terminating newline
    character, to the stream stdout.

    _ff_pp_uu_tt_ss(3) and _pp_uu_tt_ss(3) can fail and set errno to the following values:

    [EBADF]
        The stream is not a writable stream.

    [EPIPE]
        An attempt is made to write to a pipe that is not open for reading by
        any process.

    [EFBIG]
        An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the process's file
        size limit or the maximum file size.

    [EFAULT]
        Part of the data to be written to the file points outside the
        process's allocated address space.

    [EINVAL]
        The pointer associated with stream was negative.

    [ENOSPC]
        There is no free space remaining on the file system containing the
        file.

    [EIO]
        An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file
        system.

    [EAGAIN]
        The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data could be written
        immediately.
