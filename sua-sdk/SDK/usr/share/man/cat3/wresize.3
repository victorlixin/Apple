    wresize() - resize a curses window

    The _ww_rr_ee_ss_ii_zz_ee(3) function adjusts the dimensions of an nnccuurrsseess window to the
    specified values, reallocating storage as necessary.

    If either dimension is larger than the current values, the window's data
    is filled with blanks that have the current background rendition (as set
    by wwbbkkggnnddsseett()) merged into them. If the current cursor position is
    outside the retained area of the window, the cursor is moved to within the
    nearest window edge. Window data is otherwise preserved.

    This function will fail if either of the new dimensions less than or equal
    to zero, or if memory cannot be allocated or reallocated for the window.

    Note that _ww_rr_ee_ss_ii_zz_ee(3) performs non-reentrant mmaalllloocc() operations, so it
    isn't advisable to resize from within an interrupt handler. Instead, have
    your handler set an event flag to be interpreted next time around your
    program's command loop.

    This call was designed for nnccuurrsseess and is not found in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD
    curses, or any other previous version of curses. It is recommended that
    you conditionalize all code depending on it with the symbol NCURSES.

    The function returns the integer ERR upon failure and OK on success.
