    in the window; all lines below the current line are moved up one line. The
    bottom line of the window is cleared. The cursor position does not change.

    The _ii_nn_ss_dd_ee_ll_ll_nn(3) and _ww_ii_nn_ss_dd_ee_ll_ll_nn(3) routines, for positive n, insert n lines
    into the specified window above the current line. The n bottom lines are
    lost. For negative n, delete n lines (starting with the one under the
    cursor), and move the remaining lines up. The bottom n lines are cleared.
    The current cursor position remains the same.

    The _ii_nn_ss_ee_rr_tt_ll_nn(3) and _ii_nn_ss_ee_rr_tt_ll_nn(3) routines, insert a blank line above the
    current line and the bottom line is lost.

    All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an OK (SVr4 specifies
    only "an integer value other than ERR") upon successful completion.

    These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4. The
    standard specifies that they return ERR on failure, but specifies no error
    conditions.

    Note that all but _ww_ii_nn_ss_dd_ee_ll_ll_nn(3) may be a macros.

    These routines do not require a hardware line delete or insert feature in
    the terminal. In fact, they won't use hardware line delete/insert unless

    idlok(..., TRUE)

    has been set on the current window.
