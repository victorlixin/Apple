    Every form has an associated pair of ccuurrsseess windows. The form window
    displays any title and border associated with the window; the form
    subwindow displays the items of the form that are currently available for
    selection.

    The first four functions get and set those windows. It is not necessary to
    set either window; by default, the driver code uses stdscr for both.

    In the set_ functions, window argument of NULL is treated as though it
    were stsdcr A form argument of NULL is treated as a request to change the
    system default form window or subwindow.

    The function _ss_cc_aa_ll_ee____ww_ii_nn_dd_oo_ww(3) returns the minimum size required for the
    subwindow of form.

    Routines that return pointers return NULL on error. Routines that return
    an integer return one of the following error codes:

    E_OK
        The routine succeeded.

    E_SYSTEM_ERROR
        System error occurred (see errno

    E_BAD_ARGUMENT
        Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

    E_POSTED
        The form has already been posted.

    E_NOT_CONNECTED
        No items are connected to the form.
