    The rraannlliibb utility was used on many historical systems for maintaining .a
    libraries. On many current systems, including Interix, it serves no
    purpose, because _a_r(1) and lib.exe each have subsumed its functionality.

    The Interix rraannlliibb utility performs no actual function: it ignores all
    options and arguments, and it simply exits with a status of 0. It is
    provided with Interix only for the sake of maintaining compatibility with
    existing makefiles.
