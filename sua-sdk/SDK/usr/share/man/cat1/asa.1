    The aassaa(1) utility reads text with ASA carriage-control characters from
    the files specified as its command arguments, or standard input if none
    are specified, and converts them into line printer control sequences.

    These control characters are traditionally used in Fortran programs.

    The first character of every line is removed from input, and the following
    actions are performed according to which character is removed.

    If the character removed is:

    <space>
        The rest of the line is output without change

    0
        A <newline> is output, then the rest of the input line

    1
        A <form feed> is output, then the rest of the input line

    +
        An attempt is made to overstrike the previous line with the one
        following the character; this can be used for emphasis

    <any other character>
        The same actions as for a <space> are performed; this is an extension
        of the POSIX.2 standard

    The overstriking generated may be removed by piping the output through ccooll
    --bb.

    Tabs in the input file are expanded to a width of eight.

    It is not be possible to use the aassaa(1) filter for interactive use in
    Fortran programs because of the semantics of the ++ character, and because
    I/O is buffered.
