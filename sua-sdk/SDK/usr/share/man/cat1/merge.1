    The mmeerrggee(1) command combines two sets of changes from a base file into a
    single file. Suppose the original version is file2, and file1 and file3
    contain nonconflicting changes to file2. The mmeerrggee(1) utility incorporates
    all changes that lead from file2 to file3 into file1. The result goes to
    standard output if --pp is present, and into file1 otherwise. The mmeerrggee(1)
    utility is useful for combining separate changes to an original. Suppose
    file2 is the original, and both file1 and file3 are modifications of
    file2. In this case, mmeerrggee(1) combines both changes.

    An overlap occurs if both file1 and file3 have changes in a common segment
    of lines. On a few older hosts where ddiiffff33(1) does not support the --
    EE option, mmeerrggee(1) does not detect overlaps and merely supplies the
    changed lines from file3. On most hosts, if overlaps occur, mmeerrggee(1)
    outputs a message (unless the --qq option is given), and includes both
    alternatives in the result. The alternatives are delimited as follows:

    <<<<<<<<<<<<<< file1
    lines in file1
    =======
    lines in file3
    >>>>>>> file3

    If there are overlaps, the user should edit the result and delete one of
    the alternatives. If the --LL label1 and --LL label3 options are given, the
    labels are output in place of the names file1 and file3 in overlap
    reports.

    Exit status is 0 for no overlaps, 1 for some overlaps, 2 for trouble.

    Suppose you have the file hhaarrddwwaarree, which contains this text:

    Clips      $1
    Grommets   $1
    Snaps      $1

    At some point, you changed the price of grommets and saved this in a new
    file, hhaarrddwwaarree..nneeww, which contains:

    Clips      $2
    Grommets   $1
    Snaps      $1

    You also have a sale price for screws, saved in the file hhaarrddwwaarree..ssaallee:

    Clips      $1
    Grommets   $1
    Snaps      $0.5

    The mmeerrggee(1) command results in the following output (with the --pp option):

    $ merge -p hardware.new hardware hardware.sale
    Clips      $2
    Grommets   $1
    Snaps      $0.5

    Without the --pp option, the contents of hhaarrddwwaarree..nneeww would be replaced by
    the merged text.
