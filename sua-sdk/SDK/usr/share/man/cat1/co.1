    The ccoo(1) utility retrieves a revision from each Revision Control System
    (RCS) file and stores it into the corresponding working file.

    If file matches an RCS suffix, it denotes an RCS file; otherwise it
    denotes a working file. Names are paired as explained in ccii(1).

    --dddate
        Retrieve the latest revision on the selected branch whose check-in
        date and time is less than or equal to date. The date and time may be
        given in free format. The time zone LLTT stands for local time; other
        common time-zone names are understood. For example, the following
        dates are equivalent if local time is January 11, 1990, 8 P.M. Pacific
        Standard Time, eight hours west of Universal Time Coordinate (UTC):
        8:00 P.M. lt

        Most fields in the date and time can be defaulted. The default time
        zone is UTC. The other defaults are determined in order year, month,
        day, hour, minute, and second (most to least significant). At least
        one of these fields must be provided. For omitted fields that are of
        higher significance than the highest provided field, the time zone's
        current values are assumed. For all other omitted fields, the lowest
        possible values are assumed. For example, the date 2200,, 1100::3300 defaults
        to 10:30:00 UTC of the 20th of the UTC time zone's current month and
        year. The date and time must be quoted if it contains spaces.
    --ff[rev]
        Force the overwriting of the working file; useful in connection with --
        qq. (See FILE MODES.)
    --II[rev]
        Set interactive mode; the user is prompted and questioned even if the
        standard input is not a terminal.
    --jjjoinlist
        Generate a new revision, which is the join of the revisions on
        joinlist. This option is is almost obsolete because of rrccssmmeerrggee(1),
        but is retained for backwards compatibility.
        The joinlist is a comma-separated list of pairs of the form rev2::rev3,
        where rev2 and rev3 are symbolic or numeric revision numbers. For the
        initial pair, rev1 denotes the revision selected by the above options
        --ff, ..., --ww. For all other pairs, rev1 denotes the revision generated
        by the previous pair. Thus, the output of one join becomes the input
        to the next.
        For each pair, ccoo(1) joins revisions rev1 and rev3 with respect to
        rev2. This means that all changes that transform rev2 into rev1 are
        applied to a copy of rev3. This is particularly useful if rev1 and
        rev3 are the ends of two branches that have rev2 as a common ancestor.
        If rev1<rev2<rev3 is on the same branch, joining generates a new
        revision which is like rev3, but with all changes that lead from rev1
        to rev2 undone. If changes from rev2 to rev1 overlap with changes from
        rev2 to rev3, ccoo(1) reports overlaps as described in mmeerrggee(1).
        For the initial pair, rev2 may be omitted. The default is the common
        ancestor. If any of the arguments indicate branches, the latest
        revisions on those branches are assumed. The options --ll and --uu lock or
        unlock rev1.

    --kkkk
        Generate only keyword names in keyword strings; omit their values.
        (See KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION.) For example, for the RReevviissiioonn keyword,
        generate the string $$RReevviissiioonn$$ instead of $$RReevviissiioonn:: 11..1111 $$. This
        option is useful to ignore differences due to keyword substitution
        when comparing different revisions of a file.

    --kkkkvv
        Generate keyword strings using the default form, such as $$RReevviissiioonn::
        11..1111 $$ for the RReevviissiioonn keyword. A locker's name is inserted in the
        value of the HHeeaaddeerr, IIdd, and LLoocckkeerr keyword strings only as a file is
        being locked, that is, by ccii --ll and ccoo --ll. This is the default.

    --kkkkvvll
        Like --kkkkvv, except that a locker's name is always inserted if the given
        revision is currently locked.

    --kkoo
        Generate the old keyword string, present in the working file just
        before it was checked in. For example, for the RReevviissiioonn keyword,
        generate the string $$RReevviissiioonn:: 11..11 $$ instead of $$RReevviissiioonn:: 11..1111 $$ if
        that is how the string appeared when the file was checked in. This can
        be useful for binary file formats that cannot tolerate any changes to
        substrings that happen to take the form of keyword strings.

    --kkvv
        Generate only keyword values for keyword strings. For example, for the
        RReevviissiioonn keyword, generate the string 11..1111 instead of $$RReevviissiioonn:: 11..1111
        $$. This can help generate files in programming languages where it is
        hard to strip keyword delimiters like $$RReevviissiioonn:: $$ from a string.
        However, further keyword substitution cannot be performed once the
        keyword names are removed, so this option should be used with care.
        Because of this danger of losing keywords, this option cannot be
        combined with --ll, and the owner write permission of the working file
        is turned off. To edit the file later, check it out again without --kkvv.
    --ll[rev]
        Same as --rr, except that it also locks the retrieved revision for the
        caller.
    --MM[rev]
        Set the modification time on the new working file to be the date of
        the retrieved revision. Use this option with care; it can confuse
        mmaakkee(1).
    --pp[rev]
        Print the retrieved revision on the standard output rather than
        storing it in the working file. This option is useful when ccoo(1) is
        part of a pipe.
    --qq[rev]
        Quiet mode; diagnostics are not printed.
    --rr[rev]
        Retrieves the latest revision whose number is less than or equal to
        rev. If rev indicates a branch rather than a revision, the latest
        revision on that branch is retrieved. If rev is omitted, the latest
        revision on the default branch (see the --bb option of rrccss(1)) is
        retrieved. If rev is $$, ccoo(1) determines the revision number from
        keyword values in the working file. Otherwise, a revision is composed
        of one or more numeric or symbolic fields separated by periods. The
        numeric equivalent of a symbolic field is specified with the --nn option
        of the commands ccii(1) and rrccss(1).
    --ssstate
        Retrieve the latest revision on the selected branch whose state is set
        to state.
    --uu[rev]
        Same as --rr, except that it unlocks the retrieved revision if it was
        locked by the caller. If rev is omitted, --uu retrieves the revision
        locked by the caller, if there is one. Otherwise, it retrieves the
        latest revision on the default branch.
    --VVn
        Emulate RCS version n, where n may be 33, 44, or 55. This may be useful
        when interchanging RCS files with others who are running older
        versions of RCS. To see which version of RCS your correspondents are
        running, have them invoke rrlloogg on an RCS file. If none of the first
        few lines of output contain the string bbrraanncchh:: it is version 3; if the
        dates' years have just two digits, it is version 4; otherwise, it is
        version 5. An RCS file generated while emulating version 3 will lose
        its default branch. An RCS revision generated while emulating version
        4 or earlier will have a timestamp that is off by up to 13 hours. A
        revision extracted while emulating version 4 or earlier will contain
        dates of the form yyyy/mmmm/dddd instead of yyyyyyyy/mmmm/dddd and may also contain
        different white space in the substitution for $$LLoogg$$.
    --ww[logname]
        Retrieve the latest revision on the selected branch that was checked
        in by the user with login name logname. If the argument login is
        omitted, the caller's login is assumed.
    --xxsuffixes

        Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ccii(1) for details.

    Revisions of an RCS file may be checked out locked or unlocked. Locking a
    revision prevents overlapping updates. A revision checked out for reading
    or processing (such as compiling) need not be locked. A revision checked
    out for editing and later check in must usually be locked. Checkout with
    locking fails if the revision to be checked out is currently locked by
    another user. (A lock may be broken with rrccss(1)) Checkout with locking
    also requires the caller to be on the access list of the RCS file, unless
    the caller is the owner of the file or the superuser, or the access list
    is empty. Checkout without locking is not subject to access list
    restrictions and is not affected by the presence of locks.

    A revision is selected by options for revision or branch number, check-in
    date and time, author, or state. When the selection options are applied in
    combination, ccoo(1) retrieves the latest revision that satisfies all of
    them. If none of the selection options is specified, ccoo(1) retrieves the
    latest revision on the default branch (usually the trunk; see the --
    bb option of rrccss(1)).
    A revision or branch number can be attached to any of the following
    options:
    --ff
    --II
    --ll
    --MM
    --pp
    --qq
    --rr
    --uu

    The options --dd (date), --ss (state), and --ww (author) retrieve from a single
    branch, the selected branch, which is either specified by one of --ff,, ...,
    --uu, or the default branch.

    A ccoo(1) command applied to an RCS file with no revisions creates a zero-
    length working file. ccoo(1) always performs keyword substitution (see
    below).

  KKEEYYWWOORRDD SSUUBBSSTTIITTUUTTIIOONN

    Strings of the form $kkeeyywwoorrdd$ and $kkeeyywwoorrdd:......$ embedded in the text are
    replaced with strings of the form $kkeeyywwoorrdd:vvaalluuee$ where keyword and value
    are pairs listed below. Keywords may be embedded in literal strings or
    comments to identify a revision.

    Initially, the user enters strings of the form $kkeeyywwoorrdd$.. On checkout,
    ccoo(1) replaces these strings with strings of the form $kkeeyywwoorrdd:vvaalluuee$.. If
    a revision containing strings of the latter form is checked back in, the
    value fields will be replaced during the next checkout. Thus, the keyword
    values are automatically updated on checkout. This automatic substitution
    can be modified by the --kk options.

    Following are keywords and their corresponding values:

    $$AAuutthhoorr$$
        The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

    $$DDaattee$$
        The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in.

    $$HHeeaaddeerr$$
        A standard header containing the full path name of the RCS file, the
        revision number, the date (UTC), the author, the state, and the locker
        (if locked).

    $$IIdd$$
        Same as $$HHeeaaddeerr$$, except that the RCS file name is without a path.

    $$LLoocckkeerr$$
        The login name of the user who locked the revision (empty if not
        locked).

    $$LLoogg$$
        The log message supplied during check in, preceded by a header
        containing the RCS filename, the revision number, the author, and the
        date (UTC). Existing log messages are not replaced. Instead, the new
        log message is inserted after $$LLoogg::...$$. This is useful for
        accumulating a complete change log in a source file.

    $$RRCCSSffiillee$$
        The name of the RCS file without a path.

    $$RReevviissiioonn$$
        The revision number assigned to the revision.

    $$SSoouurrccee$$
        The full path name of the RCS file.

    $$SSttaattee$$
        The state assigned to the revision with the --ss option of rrccss(1) or
        ccii(1).

  FFIILLEE MMOODDEESS

    The working file inherits the read-and-execute permissions from the RCS
    file. In addition, the owner write permission is turned on, unless --kkvv is
    set or the file is checked out unlocked and locking is set to strict (see
    rrccss(1)).

    If a file with the name of the working file exists already and has write
    permission, ccoo(1) aborts the checkout, asking first if possible. If the
    existing working file is not writable or --ff is given, the working file is
    deleted without asking.

  FFIILLEESS

    ccoo(1) accesses files much as ccii(1) does, except that it does not need to
    read the working file.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS

    The ccoo(1) utility makes use of the following environment variables:

    RCSINIT
        A list of options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.
        See ccii(1) for details.

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    The RCS path name, the working path name, and the revision number that are
    retrieved are written to the diagnostic output. The exit status is zero
    only if all operations were successful.

  LLIIMMIITTSS

    Links to the RCS and working files are not preserved.

    There is no way to selectively suppress the expansion of keywords, except
    by writing them differently. In nroff and troff, this is done by embedding
    the null-character \\&& into the keyword.

  BBUUGGSS

    Sometimes the --dd option does not work properly and will accept no date
    before 1970.
