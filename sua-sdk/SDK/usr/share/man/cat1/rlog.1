  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The rrlloogg(1) utility prints information about Revison Control System (RCS)
    files.

    Path names matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all others denote
    working files. Names are paired as explained in ccii(1).

    The rrlloogg(1) utility prints the following information for each RCS file:
    RCS path name, working path name, head (that is, the number of the latest
    revision on the trunk), default branch, access list, locks, symbolic
    names, suffix, total number of revisions, number of revisions selected for
    printing, and descriptive text. This is followed by entries for the
    selected revisions in reverse chronological order for each branch. For
    each revision, rrlloogg(1) prints revision number, author, date and time,
    state, number of lines added/deleted (with respect to the previous
    revision), locker of the revision (if any), and log message. All times are
    displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Without options, rrlloogg(1)
    prints complete information. The options below restrict this output.

    NNoottee:: Options cannot be catenated: the flag --LLRR is different from --LL --RR.

    --bb
        Print information about the revisions on the default branch, normally
        the highest branch on the trunk.
    --dddates
        Print information about revisions with a check-in date and time in the
        ranges given by the semicolon-separated list of dates. A range of the
        form d1<<d2 or d2>>d1 selects the revisions that were deposited from d1
        to d2, inclusive. A range of the form <<d or d>> selects all revisions
        dated d or earlier. A range of the form d<< or >>d selects all revisions
        dated d or later. A range of the form d selects the single, latest
        revision dated d or earlier. The date and time strings d, d1, and d2
        are in the free format explained in ccoo(1). Quoting is normally
        necessary, especially for << and >>. The separator is a semicolon (;;).

    --hh
        Print only the RCS path name, working path name, head, default branch,
        access list, locks, symbolic names, and suffix.

    --LL
        Ignore RCS files that have no locks set. This is convenient in
        combination with --hh, --ll, and --RR.
    --lllockers
        Print information about locked revisions only. In addition, if the
        comma-separated list lockers of login names is given, ignore all locks
        other than those held by the lockers. For example, rrlloogg --LL --RR --llwwfftt
        RRCCSS//** prints the name of RCS files locked by the user wwfftt.

    --RR
        Print only the name of the RCS file. This is convenient for
        translating a working path name into an RCS path name.
    --rrrevisions

        Print information about revisions given in the comma-separated list
        revisions of revisions and ranges. A range rev1::rev2 means revisions
        rev1 to rev2 on the same branch, ::rev means revisions from the
        beginning of the branch up to and including rev, and rev:: means
        revisions starting with rev to the end of the branch containing rev.
        An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that branch. A
        range of branches means all revisions on the branches in that range. A
        branch followed by a .. means the latest revision in that branch. A
        bare --rr with no revisions means the latest revision on the default
        branch, normally the trunk.
    --ssstates
        Print information about revisions whose state attributes match one of
        the states given in the comma-separated list states.

    --tt
        Print the same as --hh, plus the descriptive text.
    --VVn
        Emulate RCS version n when generating logs. See ccoo(1) for more.
    --wwlogins
        Print information about revisions checked in by users with login names
        appearing in the comma-separated list logins. If logins is omitted,
        the user's login is assumed.
    --xxsuffixes
        Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ccii(1) for details.

    The rrlloogg(1) utility prints the intersection of the revisions selected with
    the options --dd, --ll, --ss, and --ww, intersected with the union of the
    revisions selected by --bb and --rr.

  EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS

    This command prints the names of all RCS files in the subdirectory RRCCSS
    that have locks:

    $$ rlog  -L  -R  RCS/*

    To print the headers of those files, use:

    $$ rlog  -L  -h  RCS/*

    To print the headers plus the log messages of the locked revisions, use:

    $$ rlog  -L  -l  RCS/*

    To print complete information about all RCS files in the subdirectory RRCCSS,
    use:

    $$ rlog  RCS/*

  BBUUGGSS

    The separator for revision ranges in the --rr option used to be -- instead of
    ::, but this leads to confusion when symbolic names contain --. For
    backwards compatibility rrlloogg --rr still supports the old -- separator, but it
    warns about this obsolete use.
