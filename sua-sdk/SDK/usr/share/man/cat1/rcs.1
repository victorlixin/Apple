  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The rrccss(1) utility creates new Revision Control System (RCS) files, or
    changes attributes of existing ones. An RCS file contains multiple
    revisions of text, an access list, a change log, descriptive text, and
    some control attributes. For rrccss(1) to work, the caller's login name must
    be on the access list, unless the access list is empty, the caller is the
    owner of the file or the superuser, or the --ii option is present.

    Path names matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all others denote
    working files. Names are paired as explained in ccii(1). Revision numbers
    use the syntax described in ccii(1).

    The rrccss(1) accepts the following options:
    --aalogins
        Append the login names appearing in the comma-separated list logins to
        the access list of the RCS file.
    --AAoldfile
        Append the access list of oldfile to the access list of the RCS file.
    --bb[rev]
        Set the default branch to rev. If rev is omitted, the default branch
        is reset to the (dynamically) highest branch on the trunk.
    --ccstring
        Set the comment leader to string. The comment leader is printed before
        every log message line generated by the keyword $$LLoogg$$ during checkout
        (see ccoo(1)). This is useful for programming languages without
        multiline comments. An initial ccii(1), or an rrccss --ii without --cc, guesses
        the comment leader from the suffix of the working file.
    --ee[logins]
        Erase the login names appearing in the comma-separated list logins
        from the access list of the RCS file. If logins is omitted, erase the
        entire access list.

    --ii
        Create and initialize a new RCS file, but do not deposit any revision.
        If the RCS file has no path prefix, try to place it first into the
        subdirectory ..//RRCCSS, and then into the current directory. If the RCS
        file already exists, print an error message.

    --II
        Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a terminal.
    --kksubst
        Set the default keyword substitution to subst. The effect of keyword
        substitution is described in ccoo(1). Giving an explicit --kk option to
        ccoo(1), rrccssddiiffff(1), and rrccssmmeerrggee(1) overrides this default. Beware rrccss
        --kkvv, because --kkvv is incompatible with ccoo --ll. Use rrccss --kkkkvv to restore
        the normal default keyword substitution.
    --ll[rev]
        Lock the revision with number rev. If a branch is given, lock the
        latest revision on that branch. If rev is omitted, lock the latest
        revision on the default branch. Locking prevents overlapping changes.
        A lock is removed with ccii(1) or rrccss --uu (see later in this topic).

    --LL
        Set locking to strict. Strict locking means that the owner of an RCS
        file is not exempt from locking for checkin. This option should be
        used for files that are shared.
    --mmrev::msg
        Replace revision rev's log message with msg.
    --nnname[::[rev]]
        Associate the symbolic name name with the branch or revision rev.
        Delete the symbolic name if both :: and rev are omitted; otherwise,
        print an error message if name is already associated with another
        number. If rev is symbolic, it is expanded before association. A rev
        consisting of a branch number followed by a .. stands for the current
        latest revision in the branch. A :: with an empty rev stands for the
        current latest revision on the default branch, normally the trunk. For
        example, rrccss --nnname:: RRCCSS//** associates name with the current latest
        revision of all the named RCS files; this contrasts with rrccss --nnname::
        $$ RRCCSS//**, which associates name with the revision numbers extracted
        from keyword strings in the corresponding working files.
    --NNname[::[rev]]
        Act like --nn, except override any previous assignment of name.
    --oorange
        Deletes (outdates) the revisions given by range. A range consisting of
        a single revision number means that revision. A range consisting of a
        branch number means the latest revision on that branch. A range of the
        form rev1::rev2 means revisions rev1 to rev2 on the same branch; ::rev
        means from the beginning of the branch containing rev up to and
        including rev, and rev:: means from revision rev to the end of the
        branch containing rev. None of the outdated revisions can have
        branches or locks.

    --qq
        Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.
    --ssstate[::rev]
        Set the state attribute of the revision rev to state. If rev is a
        branch number, assume the latest revision on that branch. If rev is
        omitted, assume the latest revision on the default branch. Any
        identifier is acceptable for state. A useful set of states is EExxpp (for
        experimental), SSttaabb (for stable), and RReell (for released). By default,
        ccii(1) sets the state of a revision to EExxpp.
    --tt[file]
        Write descriptive text from the contents of the named file into the
        RCS file, deleting the existing text. The file path name cannot begin
        with a period (..). If file is omitted, obtain the text from standard
        input, terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing .. by itself.
        Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see --II. With --ii,
        descriptive text is obtained even if --tt is not given.
    --tt--string
        Write descriptive text from the string into the RCS file, deleting the
        existing text.
    --uu[rev]
        Unlock the revision with number rev. If a branch is given, unlock the
        latest revision on that branch. If rev is omitted, remove the latest
        lock held by the caller. Normally, only the locker of a revision can
        unlock it. Somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock. This
        causes a mail message to be sent to the original locker. The message
        contains a commentary solicited from the breaker. The commentary is
        terminated by end-of-file or by a line containing .. by itself.

    --UU
        Set locking to non-strict. Non-strict locking means that the owner of
        a file need not lock a revision for checkin. This option should not be
        used for files that are shared. Whether default locking is strict is
        determined by your system administrator, but it is usually strict.
    --VVn
        Emulate RCS version n. See ccoo(1) for details.
    --xxsuffixes
        Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ccii(1) for details.

  CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY

    The --bb rev option generates an RCS file that cannot be parsed by RCS
    version 3 or earlier.

    The --kk subst options (except --kkkkvv) generate an RCS file that cannot be
    parsed by RCS version 4 or earlier.

    Use rrccss --VVn to make an RCS file acceptable to RCS version n by discarding
    information that would confuse version n.

    RCS versions 5.5 and earlier do not support the --xx option, and require a
    ,,vv suffix on an RCS path name.

  FFIILLEESS

    The rrccss(1) utility accesses files much as ccii(1) does, except that it uses
    the effective user for all accesses, it does not write the working file or
    its directory, and it does not even read the working file unless a
    revision number of $$ is specified.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    RCSINIT
        Contains a list of options prepended to the argument list, separated
        by spaces. See ccii(1) for details.

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    The RCS path name and the revisions outdated are written to the diagnostic
    output. The exit status is zero only if all operations were successful.

  BBUUGGSS

    The separator for revision ranges in the --oo option used to be -- instead of
    ::, but this leads to confusion when symbolic names contain --.. For
    backwards compatibility rrccss --oo still supports the old -- separator, but it
    warns about this obsolete use.

    Symbolic names need not refer to existing revisions or branches. For
    example, the --oo option does not remove symbolic names for the outdated
    revisions; you must use --nn to remove the names.
