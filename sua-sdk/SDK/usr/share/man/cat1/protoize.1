    The pprroottooiizzee(1) and uunnpprroottooiizzee(1) utilities convert C source files between
    the traditional (K&R) formats and the ANSI/ISO C standard format
    (including prototypes). Both tools make use of the ggcccc(1) compiler, which
    must be installed on your system.

    The pprroottooiizzee(1) utility converts existing function declarations and
    definitions into prototype form, and can insert declarations and
    prototypes for functions that are implicitly declared. The uunnpprroottooiizzee(1)
    utility reverses the process.

    The files indicated by file must be source files, not header files. The
    utilities compile the files to find the functions they define. Information
    about the functions in file is saved in the file file..XX; the ..XX files are
    normally deleted (but see --xx). The converted files replace the original
    files, which are renamed with the file extension ..ssaavvee. If the save file
    already exists, the source file is discarded.

    The pprroottooiizzee(1) and uunnpprroottooiizzee(1) utilities take the following options:
    --BB dir
        Look in directory dir for the SSYYSSCCAALLLLSS..cc..XX file.

    --CC
        Rename the files to end in ..CC instead of ..cc. This can be useful when
        converting C++ files, but will not work properly on file systems
        available across a network where case sensitivity is not available.
        This option is available in pprroottooiizzee(1) only.
    --cc compile_opts
        Pass compile_opts to ggcccc(1) when creating the ..XX file. The options
        must be passed as a single argument, and the options --gg, --OO, --cc, --SS,
        and --oo are ignored if they are part of compile_opts.
    --dd dirlist
        Search the directories in dirlist for files to be converted. Files in
        those directories named with the --xx option will not be converted.

    --gg
        Add a global declaration for each function that is called and not
        declared. The declarations are inserted at the beginning of the file
        before the first function definition that contains a call to an
        undeclared function. This option is for pprroottooiizzee(1) only.
    --ii indentstring
        Indent the old-style parameter declarations with the specified
        indentstring. This option is for uunnpprroottooiizzee(1) only.

    --kk
        Keep the ..XX files; normally they are deleted.

    --ll
        Add a local declaration for each function that is called and not
        declared. A prototype declaration is inserted into each block that
        calls the function without a declaration. This option is for
        pprroottooiizzee(1) only.

    --NN
        Do not create ..ssaavvee files; delete the originals. This is a dangerous
        option to use.

    --nn
        Do not change the files; instead, print information about the
        conversions that would have been done.
    --pp compiler
        Use the specified compiler instead of ggcccc(1). This is intended for use
        with alternate versions of ggcccc(1).

    --qq
        Quiet mode; suppress warnings about definitions and declarations that
        cannot be converted.

    --VV
        Display version number.

    --vv
        Synonym for --VV; display the version number of pprroottooiizzee(1) or
        uunnpprroottooiizzee(1).
    --xx filelist
        Exclude the files in filelist from conversion.

  DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS

    The pprroottooiizzee(1) utility exits with status 0 for success, and >0 if an
    error occurred.

  FFIILLEESS

    The pprroottooiizzee(1) utility makes use of the following file:

    //uussrr//ccoonnttrriibb//lliibb//ggcccc--lliibb//ii338866--ppcc--iinntteerriixx//ccyyggnnuuss--22..77..22--997700440044//SSYYSSCCAALLLLSS..cc..XX
        Information about system calls. Use the --BB option to specify a
        different directory for the SSYYSSCCAALLLLSS..cc..XX file.
