    The aarr(1) utility creates and maintains groups of files combined into an
    archive. After you have created an archive, you can use aarr(1) to modify
    its contents by adding new files and by deleting, extracting, or replacing
    existing files.

    NOTE:In Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications, there are two
    versions of ar: one is for x86 computers, and one is for AMD64 computers, 
    But the appropriate version is always linked to /bin/ar. On an AMD64
    computer, if you wish to create a 32-bit compilation archive, use 
    /opt/gcc.3.3/bin/ar; on an x86 computer, if you wish to create a 64-bit 
    compilation archive, use /bin/ar_amd64. Also note that the ar_amd64 
    command has limited functionality by comparison.

    The most common use of aarr(1) is to combine object files into a library
    archive. If all of the specified files are valid object files, aarr(1)
    automatically creates a library. If some of the specified files are not
    valid object files (for example, if they are text files), the library may
    not be valid.

    The first option given to aarr(1) specifies the type of action; the
    remaining options modify that action. The -- may be omitted from the type
    of action.

    *     To create an archive, use --rr.
    *     To delete an archive member, use --dd.
    *     To replace existing archive members or to add a member to the
          archive, use --rr.
    *     To print the contents of an archive, use --pp.
    *     To provide a table of contents for the archive, use --tt.
    *     To extract members from the archive, use --xx.

    The file can be a path name if the file is being added to the archive from
    the system (whether as a replacement or a new file). If the file is
    already stored in the archive (for example, when moving, deleting, or
    extracting), file should be the last component of the member's path name.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    --aa
        Add new files to the archive after the member file named by posname.

    --bb
        Add new files to the archive before the member file named by posname.

    --cc
        Suppress diagnostic message. Normally, aarr(1) writes a message to
        standard error when archive is created. This option is only useful
        with --cc and --rr.

    --CC
        When extracting files, protect existing files in the file system from
        being overwritten by members with similar names. This is particularly
        useful with the --TT option, to prevent truncated file names from being
        overwritten by files with the same prefix.

    --dd
        Delete one or more files from the archive.

    --ff
        Truncate names of files being added to the archive. Normally, names of
        any length are allowed, but this option may be used if the native
        aarr(1) on a system does not allow names of arbitrary length.

    --ii
        Insert the new files to the archive before the member file named by
        posname (identical to --bb).

    --ll
        Work locally by placing the temporary file in the current directory,
        rather than in the directory specified by TMPDIR.

    --mm
        Move the named files within the archive. Unless the --aa, --bb, or --
        ii options are given, the files are moved to the end of the archive.
    --MM mri-script
        Control the actions of aarr(1) using a script, mri-script, or
        interactively if no argument is supplied. (This is similar to the MRI
        librarian program.) The scripting language is not described here,
        since this option does not provide all of the features of the command
        line. This option is for developers who already have scripts for the
        MRI librarian program, and is intended to make the migration to aarr(1)
        easier.

    --oo
        Preserve the original dates of members when they are extracted.
        Without this option, extracted members are given time stamps based on
        the time of extraction.

    --pp
        Print the contents of the files from the archive to standard output.
        If no files are specified, print the entire contents of the archive.
        (For a list of the archive's contents, use --tt.)

    --PP
        Match the path names recorded in the archive. The LLIIBB..EEXXEE program can
        create archives that contain path names rather than file names. This
        option causes aarr(1) to match on the full path name when looking up a
        name in the archive. (If --PP is not used, only the file name component
        of any name is used for name matching, both for names on the command
        line and for member names.) When the --xx directive is used, the
        selected member is extracted to the name given on the command line,
        whether --PP is given or not.

    --qq
        Quickly append the named files to the end of the archive without
        checking to see whether the files are already members of the archive.
        This option is useful when building a large archive a piece at a time.

    --rr
        Replace or add the files to the archive. If the archive does not
        exist, create it. Files that are added (rather than replacing existing
        members) are added to the end of the archive.

    --ss
        Write (or update) an index of the object files into the archive.

    --tt
        Write the archive's table of contents to standard output. If no files
        are specified, all members are written; otherwise, only the specified
        files are written.

    --TT
        Truncate file names if they are too long for the file system.
        Normally, aarr(1) refuses to extract files if the names are too long.

    --uu
        Update files. When this option is used with --rr, aarr(1) only replaces
        files if the modification time on the file is newer than the
        modification time of the archive member.

    --vv
        Provide verbose output.

    --VV
        Display the version number of aarr(1).

    --xx
        Extract the named files from the archive. The archive itself is not
        changed. If the file name is too long for the current file system, it
        is not extracted. If no files are specified, all files are extracted.
