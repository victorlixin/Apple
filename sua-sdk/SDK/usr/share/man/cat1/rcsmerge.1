    The rrccssmmeerrggee(1) utility incorporates the changes between two revisions of
    an Revision Control System (RCS) file into the corresponding working file.

    If file matches an RCS suffix, it denotes an RCS file; otherwise, it
    denotes a working file. Names are paired as explained in ccii(1).

    At least one revision must be specified with one of the options described
    below, usually --rr. At most, two revisions can be specified. If only one
    revision is specified, the latest revision on the default branch (normally
    the highest branch on the trunk) is assumed for the second revision.
    Revisions can be specified numerically or symbolically.

    The rrccssmmeerrggee(1) utility prints a warning if there are overlaps, and
    delimits the overlapping regions as explained in mmeerrggee(1). The command is
    useful for incorporating changes into a checked-out revision.

    The rrccssmmeerrggee(1) command takes the following options:
    --kksubst
        Use subst style keyword substitution. See ccoo(1) for details. For
        example, --kkkk --rr11..11 --rr11..22 ignores differences in keyword values when
        merging the changes from 11..11 to 11..22.
    --pp[rev]
        Send the result to standard output instead of overwriting the working
        file.
    --qq[rev]
        Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.
    --rr[rev]
        Merge with respect to revision rev. Here an empty rev stands for the
        latest revision on the default branch, normally the head.
    --VVn
        Emulate RCS version n. See ccoo(1) for details.
    --xxsuffixes
        Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ccii(1) for details.

    Suppose you have released revision 2.8 of ff..cc. Then assume that after you
    complete an unreleased revision 3.4, you receive updates to release 2.8
    from someone else. To combine the updates to 2.8 and your changes between
    2.8 and 3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file ff..cc and execute

    $$ rcsmerge  -p  -r2.8  -r3.4  f.c  >f.merged.c

    Then examine ff..mmeerrggeedd..cc. Alternatively, if you want to save the updates to
    2.8 in the RCS file, check them in as revision 2.8.1.1 and execute ccoo --jj:

    $$ ci  -r2.8.1.1  f.c
    $$ co  -r3.4  -j2.8:2.8.1.1  f.c

    As another example, the following command undoes the changes between
    revision 2.4 and 2.8 in your currently checked-out revision in ff..cc.

    $$ rcsmerge  -r2.8  -r2.4  f.c"

    Note the order of the arguments, and that ff..cc will be overwritten.
