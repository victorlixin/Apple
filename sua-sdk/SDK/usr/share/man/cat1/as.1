    GNU aass(1) is really a family of assemblers. If you have use the GNU
    assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar
    environment when you use it on another architecture. Each version has much
    in common with the others, including object file formats, most assembler
    directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.

    For information on the syntax and pseudo-ops used by GNU aass(1), see aass(1)
    entry in info (or the manual Using as: The GNU Assembler).

    aass(1) is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler
    ggcccc(1) for use by the linker lldd(1). Nevertheless, we've tried to make
    aass(1) assemble correctly everything that the native assembler would. This
    does not mean, however, that aass(1) always uses the same syntax as another
    assembler for the same architecture. For example, there are several known
    incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

    Each time you run aass(1), it assembles exactly one source program. The
    source program is made up of one or more files. (The standard input is
    also a file.)

    If aass(1) is given no file names, it attempts to read one input file from
    the aass(1) standard input, which is normally your terminal. You might have
    to type CCoonnttrrooll--DD to tell aass(1) that there is no more program to assemble.
    Use two hyphens (----) if you must explicitly name the standard input file
    in your command line.

    aass(1) may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file
    (usually your terminal). This should not happen when aass(1) is run
    automatically by a compiler. Warnings report an assumption made so that
    aass(1) could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave
    problem that stops the assembly.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    --aa suboptions
        Turn on assembly listings. There are various suboptions. dd omits
        debugging directives. hh includes the high-level source code; this is
        only available if the source file can be found, and the code was
        compiled with --gg. ll includes an assembly listing. nn omits forms
        processing. ss includes a symbol listing. == file sets the listing file
        name; this must be the last suboption. The default suboptions are hhllss.

    --DD
        This option is accepted only for script compatibility with calls to
        other assemblers; it has no effect on aass(1).
    ----ddeeffssyymm SYM==VALUE
        Define the symbol SYM to be VALUE before assembling the input file.
        VALUE must be an integer constant. As in C, a leading 0x indicates a
        hexadecimal value, and a leading 0 indicates an octal value.

    --ff
        Fast. Skip preprocessing (assume source is compiler output).
    --II path
        Add path to the search list for ..iinncclluuddee directives.

    --KK
        Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long displacements.

    --LL
        Keep (in symbol table) local symbols, starting with LL.

    --MM,, ----mmrrii
        Assemble in MRI-compatibility mode.
    --oo objfile
        Name the object-file output from aass(1).

    --RR
        Fold data section into text section.

    --vv
        Announce aass(1) version.

    --WW
        Suppress warning messages.

    ----ffiilleess......
        Source files to assemble, or standard input (----)
    --AA var
        (When configured for Intel 960.)
        Specify which variant of the 960 architecture is the target.

    --bb
        (When configured for Intel 960.)
        Add code to collect statistics about branches taken.

    --nnoo--rreellaaxx
        (When configured for Intel 960.)
        Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long displacements;
        error if necessary.

    --ll
        (When configured for Motorola 68000).
        Shorten references to undefined symbols to one word instead of two.

    --mmcc6688000000||--mmcc6688001100||--mmcc6688002299
        (When configured for Motorola 68000).
        Specify which processor in the 68000 family is the target (default
        68020).

    Options may be in any order, and may be before, after, or between file
    names. The order of file names is significant.

    The option ---- (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
    explicitly, as one of the files for aass(1) to assemble.

    Except for ---- (two hyphens), any command-line argument that begins with a
    hyphen (--) is an option. Each option changes the behavior of aass(1). No
    option changes the way another option works. An option is a -- followed by
    one or more letters; the case of the letter is important. All options are,
    in fact, optional.

    The --oo option expects exactly one file name to follow. The file name may
    either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible with older
    assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU standard).

    These two command lines are equivalent:

    as  -o  my-object-file.o  mumble.s
    as  -omy-object-file.o  mumble.s
