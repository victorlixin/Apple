  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

    The lldd(1) utility combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
    their data and ties up symbol references. Often, the last step in building
    a new compiled program to run is a call to lldd(1).

    The lldd(1) utility accepts Linker Command Language files to provide
    explicit and total control over the linking process. This topic does not
    describe the command language; see the lldd(1) entry in iinnffoo or the manual
    ld: the GNU linker, for full details on the command language and on other
    aspects of the GNU linker.

    This version of lldd(1) uses the general purpose BFD libraries to operate on
    object files. This allows lldd(1) to read, combine, and write object files
    in many different formats, for example, COFF or aa..oouutt. Different formats
    can be linked together to produce any available kind of object file. You
    can use oobbjjdduummpp --ii to get a list of formats supported on various
    architectures; see oobbjjdduummpp(1).

    In addition to being flexible, the GNU linker is more helpful than other
    linkers in providing diagnostic information. Many linkers abandon
    execution immediately upon encountering an error. Whenever possible, lldd(1)
    continues executing, which allows you to identify other errors (or, in
    some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).

    The GNU linker lldd(1) is meant to cover a broad range of situations and to
    be as compatible as possible with other linkers. As a result, you have
    many choices to control its behavior through the command line and through
    environment variables.

  OOPPTTIIOONNSS

    The command-line options to lldd(1) can be specified in any order, and can
    be repeated at will. Usually, repeating an option with a different
    argument will either have no further effect, or it will override the prior
    occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of an option.

    The exceptions that can meaningfully be used more than once are --AA, --bb (or
    its synonym --ffoorrmmaatt), --ddeeffssyymm, --LL, --ll, --RR, and --uu.

    The list of object files to be linked together, shown as objfile, can
    follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options, except that an
    objfile argument cannot be placed between an option flag and its argument.

    Usually, the linker is invoked with at least one object file. Other forms
    of binary input files can also be specified with --ll, --RR, and the script
    command language, however. If no binary input files are specified, the
    linker does not produce any output, and it issues the message "No input
    files."

    Option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
    white space, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
    option that requires them.
    --AA architecture
        In the current release of lldd(1), this option is useful only for the
        Intel 960 family of architectures. In that lldd(1) configuration, the
        architecture argument is one of the two-letter names identifying
        members of the 960 family. The option specifies the desired output
        target, and warns of any incompatible instructions in the input files.
        It also modifies the linker's search strategy for archive libraries,
        to support the use of libraries specific to each particular
        architecture, by including in the search loop names suffixed with the
        string identifying the architecture.
        For example, if your lldd(1) command line included --AACCAA and --llttrryy, the
        linker would look (in its built-in search paths and in any paths you
        specify with --LL) for a library with the names
        try
        libtry.a tryca libtryca.a
        The first two possibilities would be considered in any event; the last
        two are due to the use of --AACCAA.
        Future releases of lldd(1) might support similar functionality for other
        architecture families.
        You can meaningfully use --AA more than once on a command line if an
        architecture family allows combination of target architectures. Each
        use will add another pair of name variants to search for when --
        ll specifies a library.
    ----aarrcchhiitteeccttuurree==architecture
        Equivalent to --AA.
    --bb input-format
        Specify the binary format for input object files that follow this
        option on the command line. You do not usually need to specify this
        because lldd(1) is configured to expect as a default input format the
        most usual format on each computer. input-format is a text string, the
        name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries. Using --
        ffoorrmmaatt input-format has the same effect, as does the script command
        TTAARRGGEETT.
        You might want to use this option if you are linking files with an
        unusual binary format. You can also use --bb to switch formats
        explicitly (when linking object files of different formats) by
        including --bb input-format before each group of object files in a
        particular format.
        The default format is taken from the environment variable GNUTARGET.
        You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
        TTAARRGGEETT.

    --BBssttaattiicc
        Do not link against shared libraries. This is only meaningful on
        platforms for which shared libraries are supported.

    --BBddyynnaammiicc
        Link against dynamic libraries. This is only meaningful on platforms
        for which shared libraries are supported. This option is normally the
        default on such platforms.

    --BBssyymmbboolliicc
        When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to
        the definitions within the shared library, if there are any. Normally,
        it is possible for a program linked against a shared library to
        override the definition within the shared library. This option is only
        meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared libraries.
    --cc commandfile
        Directs lldd(1) to read link commands from the file commandfile. These
        commands will completely override the lldd(1)default link format (rather
        than adding to it); commandfile must specify everything necessary to
        describe the target format.
        You can also include a script of link commands directly in the command
        line by bracketing it between { and } characters.
        This is not a way to extend the command line, that is, to bypass the
        command line-length limitation imposed by ARG_MAX. The script
        here describes link commands in built-in language, MRI. The --cc option
        is also known as ----mmrrii--ssccrriipptt.

    ----ccrreeff
        Output a cross reference table. If a linker map file is being
        generated, the cross-reference table is printed to the map file.
        Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.
    --dd, -ddcc, --ddpp
        These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
        compatibility with other linkers. Use any of them to make lldd(1) assign
        space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is specified
        (--rr). The script command FFOORRCCEE__CCOOMMMMOONN__AALLLLOOCCAATTIIOONN has the same effect.
    --ddeeffssyymm symbol--expression
        Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute
        address given by expression. You can use this option as many times as
        necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line. A limited
        form of arithmetic is supported for the expression in this context:
        you can give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing symbol
        or use ++ and -- to add or subtract hexadecimal constants or symbols. If
        you need more elaborate expressions, consider using the linker command
        language from a script.

    --ddllll
        Link with a dynamic-link library (DLL). Note that the entire option
        must be spelled out completely, due to a conflict with the --dd option.
    --ee entry
        Use entry as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
        program rather than using the default entry point.

    --eemmbbeeddddeedd--rreellooccss
        This option is only meaningful when linking MIPS embedded PIC code,
        generated by the --mmeemmbbeeddddeedd--ppiicc option to the GNU compiler and
        assembler. It causes the linker to create a table that can be used at
        run time to relocate any data that was statically initialized to
        pointer values.

    --EE,, ----eexxppoorrtt--ddyynnaammiicc
        When creating an ELF file, add all symbols to the dynamic-symbol
        table. Normally, the dynamic-symbol table contains only symbols that
        are used by a dynamic object. This option is needed for some uses of
        _dd_ll_oo_pp_ee_nn(3).
    --ff name
    ----aauuxxiilliiaarryy name
        When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY
        field to the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the
        symbol table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary
        filter on the symbol table of the shared object name.
    --FF name
    ----ffiilltteerr name
        When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field
        to the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
        table of the shared object should be used as a filter on the symbol
        table of the shared object name.
    ----ffoorrmmaatt input-format
        Synonym for --bb input-format.

    --gg
        Accepted, but ignored; this is provided for compatibility with other
        tools.
    --GG size
        Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
        to size under MIPS ECOFF. Ignored for other object file formats.
    --hh name
    --ssoonnaammee name
        When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field
        to the specified name. When an executable is linked with a shared
        object that has a DT_SONAME field, and the executable is run, the
        dynamic linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the
        DT_SONAME field rather than the using the file name given to the
        linker.

    ----hheellpp
        Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard output and
        exit. This option and ----vveerrssiioonn begin with two dashes instead of one
        for compatibility with other GNU programs. The other options start
        with only one dash for compatibility with other linkers.

    --ii
        Perform an incremental link (same as option --rr).
    --ll ar
        Add an archive file ar to the list of files to link. This option can
        be used any number of times. The lldd(1) utility will search its path
        list for occurrences of libaarr.a for every ar specified.
    --LL searchdir
        This command adds path searchdir to the list of paths that lldd(1) will
        search for archive libraries. You can use this option any number of
        times.
        The default set of paths searched (without being specified with --LL)
        depends on which emulation mode lldd(1) is using, and in some cases, how
        it was configured. The paths can also be specified in a link script
        with the SSEEAARRCCHH__DDIIRR command.

    --MM
        Print (to the standard output file) a link map—diagnostic information
        about where symbols are mapped by lldd(1), and information on global
        common storage allocation.
    --MMaapp mapfile
        Print to the file mapfile a link map—diagnostic information about
        where symbols are mapped by lldd(1), and information on global common
        storage allocation.
    --mm emulation
        Emulate the emulation linker. You can list the available emulations
        with the ----vveerrbboossee or --VV options. This option overrides the compiled-
        in default, which is the system for which you configured lldd(1).
    ----mmrrii==ssccrriipptt==MRI-commandfile
        Equivalent to --cc.

    --NN
        Specifies readable and writeable tteexxtt and ddaattaa sections. If the output
        format supports traditional magic numbers, the output is marked as
        OOMMAAGGIICC.
        When you use the --NN option, the linker does not page-align the data
        segment.

    --nn
        Sets the text segment to be read only, and NNMMAAGGIICC is written, if
        possible.

    --nnooiinnhhiibbiitt--eexxeecc
        Normally, the linker will not produce an output file if it encounters
        errors during the link process. With this flag, you can specify that
        you want the output file retained even after non-fatal errors. In some
        versions of ggcccc(1) and gg++++(1), this option is always passed to the
        linker, but not with Interix.

    --nnoo--kkeeeepp--mmeemmoorryy
        The linker normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching
        the symbol tables of input files in memory. This option tells the
        linker to optimize for memory usage instead by rereading the symbol
        tables as necessary. This might be required if the linker runs out of
        memory space while linking a large executable.
    --oo output
        output is a name for the program produced by lldd(1); if this option is
        not specified, the name aa..oouutt is used by default. The script command
        OOUUTTPPUUTT can also specify the output file name.
    --ooffoorrmmaatt output-format
        Specify the binary format for the output object file. You do not
        usually need to specify this, as lldd(1) is configured to produce as a
        default output format the most usual format on each computer. output-
        format is a text string, the name of a particular format supported by
        the BFD libraries. The script command OOUUTTPPUUTT__FFOORRMMAATT can also specify
        the output format, but this option overrides it.
    --RR filename
        Read symbol names and their addresses from filename, but do not
        relocate it or include it in the output. This allows your output file
        to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
        programs.

    --rr
        Generates relocatable output; that is, generates an output file that
        can, in turn, serve as input to lldd(1). This is often called partial
        linking. As a side effect, in environments that support traditional
        magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
        OOMMAAGGIICC. If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.
        When linking C++ programs, this option will not resolve references to
        constructors; --UUrr is an alternative.
        This option does the same as --ii.

    --rreellaaxx
        An option with computer-dependent effects. Currently this option is
        only supported on the H8/300.
        On some platforms, you can use this option to perform global
        optimizations that become possible when the linker resolves addressing
        in your program, such as relaxing address modes and synthesizing new
        instructions in the output object file.
        On platforms where this is not supported, --rreellaaxx is accepted, but has
        no effect.

    --rrppaatthh ddiirreeccttoorryy
        Add a directory to the run-time library search path. This is used when
        linking an ELF executable with shared objects. All --rrppaatthh arguments
        are concatenated and passed to the run-time linker, which uses them to
        locate shared objects at run time. The --rrppaatthh option is also used when
        locating shared objects that are needed by shared objects explicitly
        included in the link; see the description of the --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option.
        If --rrppaatthh is not used when linking an ELF executable, the contents of
        the environment variable LLDD__RRUUNN__PPAATTHH will be used if it is defined.
        The --rrppaatthh option can also be used on SunOS. By default, on SunOS, the
        linker will form a run-time search patch out of all of the --LL options
        it is given. If a --rrppaatthh option is used, the run-time search path will
        be formed exclusively using the --rrppaatthh options, ignoring the --
        LL options. This can be helpful when using ggcccc, which adds many --
        LL options that might be on NFS mounted file systems.

    --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk ddiirreeccttoorryy
        When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library might require another.
        This happens when an lldd --sshhaarreedd(1) link includes a shared library as
        one of the input files.
        If the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
        non-relocateable link, it will automatically try to locate the
        required shared library and include it in the link, if it is not
        included explicitly. In such a case, the --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option specifies
        the first set of directories to search. The --rrppaatthh--lliinnkk option can
        specify a sequence of directory names, either by specifying a list of
        names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple times.
        If the required shared library is not found, the linker will issue a
        warning and continue with the link.

    --SS
        Omits debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the
        output file.

    --ss
        Omits all symbol information from the output file.

    --sshhaarreedd
        Create a shared library. This is currently only supported on ELF and
        SunOS platforms (on SunOS, it is not required because the linker
        automatically creates a shared library when there are undefined
        symbols and the --ee option is not used).

    --ssoorrtt--ccoommmmoonn
        Normally, when lldd(1) places the global common symbols in the
        appropriate output sections, it sorts them by size, starting with the
        one-byte symbols, followed by the two-byte symbols, then the four-byte
        symbols, and then everything else. This prevent gaps between symbols
        that result from alignment constraints. This option disables that
        sorting.
    --sspplliitt--bbyy--rreelloocc count
        Tries to create extra sections in the output file so that no single
        output section in the file contains more than count relocations. This
        is useful when generating huge relocatables for downloading into
        certain real-time kernels with the COFF object-file format because
        COFF cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.
        Note that this will fail to work with object-file formats that do not
        support arbitrary sections. The linker will not split up individual
        input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section
        contains more than count relocations, one output section will contain
        that many relocations.

    --sspplliitt--bbyy--ffiillee
        Similar to --sspplliitt--bbyy--rreelloocc but creates a new output section for each
        input file.
    --TTbbssss org
    --TTddaattaa org
    --TTtteexxtt org
        Use org as the starting address for the bbssss, ddaattaa, or tteexxtt segment of
        the output file. The org argument is a hexadecimal integer that
        specifies an address relative to the image base, not an absolute
        address.
    --TT commandfile
        Equivalent to --cc commandfile; supported for compatibility with other
        tools. The language used for --TT is the default language, rather than
        MRI. The --TT option is also known as ----ssccrriipptt.

    --tt
        Prints names of input files as lldd(1) processes them.
    --uu sym
        Forces sym to be entered in the output file as an undefined symbol.
        This might, for example, trigger linking of additional modules from
        standard libraries. --uu can be repeated with different option arguments
        to enter additional undefined symbols.

    --UUrr
        For anything other than C++ programs, this option is equivalent to --rr:
        it generates relocatable output; that is, an output file that can, in
        turn, serve as input to lldd(1). When linking C++ programs, --UUrr will
        resolve references to constructors, unlike --rr.

    ----vveerrbboossee
        Display the version number for lldd(1) and list the supported
        emulations. Display which input files can and can not be opened.

    --vv
        Display the version number for lldd(1).

    --VV
        Display the version number and the supported emulations for lldd(1).

    ----vveerrssiioonn
        Display the version number for lldd(1) and exit.

    --wwaarrnn--ccoommmmoonn
        Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or
        with a symbol definition. Traditional linkers allow this somewhat
        inefficient practice, but other linkers may not not. This option
        allows you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.

    --wwaarrnn--ccoonnssttrruuccttoorrss
        Warn if any global constructors are used. This is only useful for a
        few object-file formats. For formats like COFF or ELF, the linker
        cannot detect the use of global constructors.

    --wwaarrnn--mmuullttiippllee--ggpp
        Warn if the output file requires multiple global-pointer values. This
        option is meaningful only for certain processors, such as those that
        are Alpha-based.

    --wwaarrnn--oonnccee
        Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
        which refers to it.

    --wwaarrnn--sseeccttiioonn--aalliiggnn
        Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
        alignment. Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
        The address will be changed only if it not explicitly specified; that
        is, if the SECTIONS command does not specify a start address for the
        section.

    ----wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee
        For each archive mentioned on the command line after the ----wwhhoollee--
        aarrcchhiivvee option, include every object file in the archive in the link,
        rather than searching the archive for the required object files. This
        is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared library,
        forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared library.

    ----nnoo--wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee
        Turn off the effect of the ----wwhhoollee--aarrcchhiivvee option for archives that
        appear later on the command line.
    ----wwrraapp symbol
        Use a wrapper function for symbol. Any undefined reference to symbol
        will be resolved to __wrap_ssyymmbbooll. Any undefined reference to
        __real_ssyymmbbooll will be resolved to symbol.

    --XX
        Delete all temporary local symbols. For most targets, this includes
        all local symbols whose names begin with LL.

    --xx
        Delete all local symbols.

  EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT

    You can change the behavior of lldd(1) with the environment variable
    GNUTARGET.

    GNUTARGET determines the input-file object format if you do not use --bb (or
    its synonym --ffoorrmmaatt). Its value should be one of the BFD names for an
    input format. If there is no GNUTARGET in the environment, lldd(1) uses the
    natural format of the host. If GNUTARGET is set to default, BFD attempts
    to discover the input format by examining binary input files. This method
    often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities because there is no
    method of ensuring that the magic number used to flag object-file formats
    is unique. The configuration procedure for BFD on each system, however,
    places the conventional format for that system first in the search-list,
    so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
