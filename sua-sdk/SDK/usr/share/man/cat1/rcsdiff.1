    The rrccssddiiffff(1) utility runs ddiiffff(1) to compare two revisions of each
    Revision Control System (RCS) file given.

    Path names matching an RCS suffix denote RCS files; all others denote
    working files. Names are paired as explained in ccii(1).

    The rrccssddiiffff(1) utility takes all the options of ddiiffff(1) that apply to
    regular files, with the same meaning as for ddiiffff(1). In addition,
    rrccssddiiffff(1) accepts the following:

    --kksubst
        Control keyword substitution when extracting revisions, as described
        in ccoo(1); for example, --kkkk --rr11..11 --rr11..22 ignores differences in keyword
        values when comparing revisions 11..11 and 11..22. To avoid excess output
        from locker name substitution, --kkkkvvll is assumed if:
       1.     At most, one revision option is given
       2.     No --kk option is given
       3.     --kkkkvv is the default keyword substitution
       4.     The working file's mode would be produced by ccoo --ll.

    --qq
        Suppress diagnostic output.
    --rrrev
        Specify a particular revision, rev. Zero, one, or two revisions can be
        specified with --rr. If both rev1 and rev2 are omitted, rrccssddiiffff(1)
        compares the latest revision on the default branch (by default the
        trunk) with the contents of the corresponding working file. This is
        useful for determining what you changed since the last checkin.
        If rev1 is given, but rev2 is omitted, rrccssddiiffff(1) compares revision
        rev1 of the RCS file with the contents of the corresponding working
        file.
        If both rev1 and rev2 are given, rrccssddiiffff(1) compares revisions rev1
        and rev2 of the RCS file.
        Both rev1 and rev2 can be given numerically or symbolically.
    --VVn
        Emulate RCS version n, where n can be 33, 44, or 55. This can be useful
        when interchanging RCS files with others that are running older
        versions of RCS. To see which version of RCS your correspondents are
        running, have them invoke rrlloogg on an RCS file; if none of the first
        few lines of output contain the string bbrraanncchh it is version 3; if the
        dates' years have just two digits, it is version 4; otherwise, it is
        version 5. An RCS file generated while emulating version 3 will lose
        its default branch. An RCS revision generated while emulating version
        4 or earlier will have a time stamp that is off by up to 13 hours. A
        revision extracted while emulating version 4 or earlier will contain
        dates of the form yyyy/mmmm/dddd instead of yyyyyyyy/mmmm/dddd, and might also
        contain different white space in the substitution for $$LLoogg$$.
    --xxsuffixes
        Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ccii(1) for details.
