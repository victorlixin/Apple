    The aaddddrr22lliinnee utility translates program addresses into file names and
    line numbers. Given an address and an executable, it uses the debugging
    information in the executable to figure out which file name and line
    number are associated with a given address.

    The executable to use is specified with the --ee option. The default is the
    file a.out.

    The aaddddrr22lliinnee utility has two modes of operation.

    In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command line, and
    aaddddrr22lliinnee displays the file name and line number for each address.

    In the second, aaddddrr22lliinnee reads hexadecimal addresses from standard input,
    and prints the file name and line number for each address on standard
    output. In this mode, aaddddrr22lliinnee may be used in a pipe to convert
    dynamically chosen addresses.

    The format of the output is FFIILLEENNAAMMEE::LLIINNEENNOO. The file name and line number
    for each address is printed on a separate line. If the --ff option is used,
    then each FFIILLEENNAAMMEE::LLIINNEENNOO line is preceded by a FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNNNAAMMEE line which is
    the name of the function containing the address.

    If the file name or function name can not be determined, aaddddrr22lliinnee will
    print two question marks in their place. If the line number can not be
    determined, aaddddrr22lliinnee will print 0.

    The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
    equivalent.
    --bb bfdname
    ----ttaarrggeett==bfdname
        Specify that the object-code format for the object files is bfdname.
    --CC
    ----ddeemmaannggllee[[==style]]
        Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
        Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
        makes C++ function names readable. Different compilers have different
        mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to
        choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.
    --ee filename
    ----eexxee==filename
        Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be
        translated. The default file is a.out.
    --ff
    ----ffuunnccttiioonnss
        Display function names as well as file and line number information.
    --ss
    ----bbaasseennaammeess
        Display only the base of each file name.
